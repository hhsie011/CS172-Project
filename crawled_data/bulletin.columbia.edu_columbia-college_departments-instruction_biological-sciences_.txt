Students have many opportunities to participate in ongoing projects in research laboratories. All the biology-related majors require one year of introductory biology, plus additional courses as detailed in the major requirements and listed on the websites provided above. For the first term of their introductory biology sequence, students may take either BIOL UN2005 INTRO BIO I: BIOCHEM,GEN,MOLEC, which has a prerequisite of chemistry, or EEEB UN2001 Environmental Biology I: Elements to Organisms, which does not require chemistry. EEEB UN2001 Environmental Biology I: Elements to Organisms may be taken in the first year. BIOL UN2005 INTRO BIO I: BIOCHEM,GEN,MOLEC should be taken later, after general chemistry. For more details, see Introductory Courses under Requirements—Major in Biology. All students interested in biology are encouraged to take BIOL UN1908 First Year Seminar in Biology in the fall semester of their first year. Premedical students should consult with their advising dean or the preprofessional office for relevant details of medical school requirements. Students interested in graduate school should consult the biology career adviser, Dr. Molly Przeworski Nonscience majors who wish to take a biology course to fulfill the science requirement are encouraged to take BIOL UN1130 Genes and Development. Interested students should consult listings in other departments for courses related to biology. Advanced Placement The department grants 3 credits for a score of 5 on the AP Biology exam. Placement is determined by the department. Students with a 5 on the AP are encouraged to take BIOL UN2005 INTRO BIO I: BIOCHEM,GEN,MOLEC and BIOL UN2006 INTRO BIO II:CELL BIO,DEV/PHYS, but are not required to do so. For details, visit http://www.columbia.edu/cu/biology/ug/advice/faqs/firstyr.html. Transfer Credit Transfer credits granted toward the degree are not automatically counted toward the major. The department determines which transfer credits can be counted toward the major. For most majors, at least four biology or biochemistry courses and at least 18 credits of the total (biology, biochemistry, math, physics, and chemistry) must be taken at Columbia. Barnard courses may not be substituted for the required Columbia courses without advance permission from the adviser. For neuroscience and behavior, one of the five biology course and one of the psychology courses may be transferred. Students who wish to count a course from outside Columbia toward their major must receive written approval from their adviser or the director of undergraduate studies. Students must supply a syllabus and/or course description to receive approval.

This program is competitive; the department cannot assure every eligible student a place in any given summer. Students apply to the program early in the spring term. A faculty committee headed by Dr. Alice Heicklen then matches selected students to appropriate labs. The deadline for SURF applications is at the beginning of the spring semester. SURF students must submit a report on their work at the end of the summer session and participate in the following year’s annual Undergraduate Research Symposium. Although it does not carry any academic credit, SURF can be used toward the lab requirement for majors and toward graduation with honors. For detailed information on all summer research programs and how to apply, please visit the SURF website. Current detailed descriptions of the SURF program and the application procedure are available at SURF's website, https://www.biology.columbia.edu/programs/surf. For more information on the Amgen Scholarship Program, please visit https://www.biology.columbia.edu/programs/amgen-scholars-program. Applications to all of these programs are through SURF. Departmental Honors Students must apply for departmental honors. Applications are due no later than one day before spring break of their senior year.

See especially undergraduate updates and list of department courses. All major and concentration requirements are detailed on the website and links provided below. Exceptions to Requirements Students must get written permission in advance for any exceptions to the requirements listed below. For the exceptions to be applied toward graduation, the student must notify the biology department in one of the following two ways: The student can file a completed paper planning form, signed by a faculty adviser, in the biology department office at 600 Fairchild; The faculty member approving the exception can send an e-mail explaining the exceptions to mes2314@columbia.edu. Grade Requirements for the Major A grade of C- or higher must be earned and revealed on your transcript for any course – including the first – to be counted toward the major or concentration requirements. The grade of P is not acceptable. A course that was taken Pass/D/Fail may be counted if and only if the P is uncovered by the Registrar's deadline. Courses Courses with the subject code HPSC or SCNC do not count toward the majors or concentrations. Major in Biology General Information The requirements for the biology major include courses in biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics. The required biology courses are one year of introductory biology, two core courses in biology or biochemistry, two 3-point electives in biology or biochemistry, and an appropriate lab experience. See below for details. The required courses outside the biology department are chemistry through organic (plus labs), one year of college-level physics (plus lab), and the completion of one year of college-level mathematics (usually calculus). Alternative sequences to the above may be arranged in special circumstances, but only with the permission of the director of undergraduate studies or a departmental adviser obtained in advance; for example, certain courses listed in the Summer Term Bulletin, the School of General Studies Bulletin, and the Barnard College Bulletin may be applied toward the major. In addition, selected courses at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center are open to advanced undergraduates. Credit toward the major for courses not listed in the Columbia College Bulletin must be discussed in advance with the director of undergraduate studies or a departmental adviser. Students are responsible for notifying the department of all exceptions either in writing or by e-mail as explained above. Alternative programs must be arranged in advance with the director of undergraduate studies. Students planning graduate work in biology should keep in mind that physical chemistry and statistics are important for many graduate programs. Introductory Courses The usual one-year introductory biology sequence is BIOL UN2005 INTRO BIO I: BIOCHEM,GEN,MOLEC-BIOL UN2006 INTRO BIO II:CELL BIO,DEV/PHYS, taken in the sophomore year, or EEEB UN2001 Environmental Biology I: Elements to Organisms-BIOL UN2006 INTRO BIO II:CELL BIO,DEV/PHYS, which may be taken in the first year. Other sequences require permission in advance from the director of undergraduate studies or departmental advisers. Students with a strong background in chemistry or molecular biology may take BIOL UN2005 INTRO BIO I: BIOCHEM,GEN,MOLEC-BIOL UN2006 INTRO BIO II:CELL BIO,DEV/PHYS in their first year; the permission of one of the instructors is required. Premedical students usually take BIOL UN2005 INTRO BIO I: BIOCHEM,GEN,MOLEC-BIOL UN2006 INTRO BIO II:CELL BIO,DEV/PHYS after a year of general chemistry; premedical students interested in the environmental sciences may take EEEB UN2001 Environmental Biology I: Elements to Organisms followed by BIOL UN2006 INTRO BIO II:CELL BIO,DEV/PHYS. Students with advanced placement in biology are expected but not required to take EEEB UN2001 Environmental Biology I: Elements to Organisms or BIOL UN2005 INTRO BIO I: BIOCHEM,GEN,MOLEC as their initial biology course, because BIOL UN2005 INTRO BIO I: BIOCHEM,GEN,MOLEC-BIOL UN2006 INTRO BIO II:CELL BIO,DEV/PHYS is taught at a level of detail and depth not found in most advanced placement courses. Students who wish to skip BIOL UN2005 INTRO BIO I: BIOCHEM,GEN,MOLEC and start with a higher-level biology course may do so, but they must obtain permission in advance from the director of undergraduate studies. For additional information, see FAQs for first-year students at http://www.columbia.edu/cu/biology/ug/advice/faqs/firstyr.html.

Prerequisites: one year each of Introductory Biology and General Chemistry. Corequisites: Organic Chemistry. Primarily aimed at nontraditional students and undergraduates who have course conflicts with BIOC UN3501. Biochemistry is the study of the chemical processes within organisms that give rise to the immense complexity of life. This complexity emerges from a highly regulated and coordinated flow of chemical energy from one biomolecule to another. This course serves to familiarize students with the spectrum of biomolecules (carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, nucleic acids, etc.) as well as the fundamental chemical processes (glycolysis, citric acid cycle, fatty acid metabolism, etc.) that allow life to happen. In particular, this course will employ active learning techniques and critical thinking problem-solving to engage students in answering the question: how is the complexity of life possible? NOTE: While Organic Chemistry is listed as a corequisite, it is highly recommended that you take Organic Chemistry beforehand.

Students will be expected to watch a weekly lecture, either in-person or via recording. Lab activities are designed to be highly interactive and collaborative to reflect the realities of biological research. Small groups of students will work together on in-class activities, as well as on a long-term student-designed biological research project BIOL UN2700 Past and future of the human genome. 3 points. CC/GS: Partial Fulfillment of Science Requirement We can now determine the genetic makeup of any person in a matter of days and at a cost already within reach for many millions of people. For the past few years a movement has emerged to provide detailed genetic information directly to ordinary people, in some cases with the explicit aim of helping prospective parents to “eliminate preventable genetic disease” or, as one newspaper put it, to promote “genetically flawless babies.” But our technical capacity to both interrogate and manipulate the human genome has raced far ahead of serious consideration of the societal implications of doing so. This course will provide students with the background necessary to understand what has and will be done with the human genome and ultimately to help society formulate appropriate policies for wise stewardship of the human genome. To help illustrate the information available in the human genome and how it may influence individuals' lives, the instructors' will share and discuss their own and other public genomes in ways both molecular and personal.

Prerequisites: (BIOL UN2005 and BIOL UN2006) This course provides an introduction to Neurogenetics, which studies the role of genetics in the development and function of the nervous system (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurogenetics). The course will be focused on teaching classic and contemporary concepts in genetics and neuroscience, rather than cataloguing mere facts. The course will emphasize the discovery processes, historical figures involved in these processes and methodologies of discovery. Primary research papers will be discussed in detail. A central organizational theme of the course is the presence of a common thread and narrative throughout the course. The common thread is an invertebrate model system, the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, which serves as a paradigm to show how simple genetic model systems have informed our view on the genetics of nervous system development and function. The ultimate goal of this course is to gain an understanding of the underlying principles of how the nervous system of one specific animal species forms, from beginning to end. The course is intended for neuroscience-inclined students (e.g. neuroscience majors) who want to learn about how genetic approaches have informed our understanding of brain development and function and, vice versa, for students with an interest in molecular biology and genetics, who want to learn about key problems in neuroscience and how genetic approaches can address them.

Open to PhD candidates in the biomedical and chemical sciences, and to other qualified graduate, undergraduate, and continuing education students with the instructor's permission. This course has three interrelated goals: (i) to develop an intuitive understanding of the thermodynamic forces that control the structure of biological macromolecules and the evolution of life, (ii) to learn how to apply that understanding to experimental analyses of macromolecular interactions, and (iii) to master the use of molecular graphics software for understanding and interpreting macromolecular structures and interactions. The lectures develop the essential thermodynamic theory from the ground up, starting from a review of the relevant physical forces (Newton's and Coulomb's Laws) and culminating with an intuitive explanation of how complex biological organisms can evolve spontaneously, in a universe in which all natural processes are driven by increasing randomness or entropy, as specified by the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics. Subsequent lectures elaborate how these thermodynamic principles govern the formation and interaction of macromolecular structures, which represent the physical foundation for the evolution of life, and how the same principles are applied to analyze related experimental data. The problem sets for the course focus on practical applications of these principles to the analysis of data from common experiments used by molecular biologists to characterize macromolecular interactions. Extensive use is made of molecular graphics software throughout the semester, including in the problem sets, based on instruction provided in both the lectures and recitation sections. The course is designed to develop a deep understanding of the physical mechanisms controlling macromolecular interactions while simultaneously empowering students to critically read related literature and rigorously design and analyze related experiments themselves.

Systems biology approaches are rapidly transforming the technological and conceptual foundations of research across diverse areas of biomedicine. In this course we will discuss the fundamental developments in systems biology with a focus on two important dimensions: (1) the unique conceptual frameworks that have emerged to study systems-level phenomena and (2) how these approaches are revealing fundamentally new principles that govern the organization and behavior of cellular systems. Although there will be much discussion of technologies and computational approaches, the course will emphasize the conceptual contributions of the field and the big questions that lie ahead. Lectures and discussions of primary literature will enable students to scrutinize research in the field and to internalize systems biology thinking in their own research. To make this a concrete endeavor, the students will develop mini-NIH-style grant proposals that aims to study a fundamental problem/question using systems biology approaches. The students will then convene an in-class NIH-style review panel that will assess the strengths and weaknesses of these proposals. In addition, the students will have the opportunity to defend their proposals in a live presentation to the class. The course is open to graduate students in Biological Sciences. Advanced undergraduates in biological sciences, and other graduate students with background in biology from other disciplines, including physics, chemistry, computer science, and engineering may also attend after consulting with the instructor Fall 2022: BIOL GU4036 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment BIOL 4036 001/10363 W 2:10pm - 4:00pm 1000 Fairchild Life Sciences Bldg Saeed Tavazoie 3.00 3/16 BIOL GU4065 Molecular Biology of Disease. 3 points.

The basic thesis of the course is that all viruses adopt a common strategy. The strategy is simple: 1. Viral genomes are contained in metastable particles. 2. Genomes encode gene products that promote an infectious cycle (mechanisms for genomes to enter cells, replicate, and exit in particles). 3. Infection patterns range from benign to lethal; infections can overcome or co-exist with host defenses. Despite the apparent simplicity, the tactics evolved by particular virus families to survive and prosper are remarkable. This rich set of solutions to common problems in host/parasite interactions provides significant insight and powerful research tools. Virology has enabled a more detailed understanding of the structure and function of molecules, cells and organisms and has provided fundamental understanding of disease and virus evolution. The course will emphasize the common reactions that must be completed by all viruses for successful reproduction within a host cell and survival and spread within a host population. The molecular basis of alternative reproductive cycles, the interactions of viruses with host organisms, and how these lead to disease are presented with examples drawn from a set of representative animal and human viruses, although selected bacterial viruses will be discussed.

Prerequisites: BIOT GU4160 BIOTECHNOLOGY LAW (BIOT W4160) This course – the first of its kind at Columbia – introduces students to a vital subfield of ethics focusing on patent and regulatory law in the biotech and pharmaceutical sectors. The course combines lectures, structured debate, and research to best present this fascinating and nuanced subject. Properly exploring this branch of bioethics requires an in-depth understanding of biotech and pharmaceutical patent and regulatory law. Students can gain this understanding by first completing Biotechnology Law (BIOT GU4160), formerly the prerequisite for this course. Now, they can also gain it by reading the appropriate chapters of Biotechnology Law: A Primer for Scientists (the textbook for BIOT GU4160 published earlier this year) prior to each class. A number of students in the biotechnology fields (such as those in biotechnology, biomedical engineering, and bioethics programs) have shown a keen interest over the years in taking this course, yet were unable to do so because they hadn’t taken BIOT GU4160. Given the recent publication of Biotechnology Law and the desirability of making BIOT GU4161 accessible to more students having the appropriate science background, BIOT GU4160 has been removed as a prerequisite Spring 2022: BIOT GU4161 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment BIOT 4161 001/14049 W 6:10pm - 8:00pm 401 Hamilton Hall Alan Morrison 3.00 11/16 BIOT GU4200 Biopharmaceutical Development & Regulation. 3 points.
