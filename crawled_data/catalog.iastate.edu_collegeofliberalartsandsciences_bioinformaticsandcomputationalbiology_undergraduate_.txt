The undergraduate B.S. degree is offered through the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. Bioinformatics and Computational Biology is an interdisciplinary science at the interfaces of the biological, informational and computational sciences. The science focuses on a variety of topics. These include gene identification, expression, and evolution; RNA, protein, and genome structure; and molecular and cellular systems and networks. The large group of participating faculty provides students with a multidimensional perspective on bioinformatics and computational biology and presents them with broad range of possibilities to get involved in research. This major will prepare students for careers at the interfaces of biological, informational and computational sciences. BCBio graduates with a B.S. seeking direct employment will find ready markets for their talents in agricultural and medical biotechnology industries, as well as in academia, national laboratories, and clinics. Although some students find employment directly after their baccalaureate training, many students will continue their education in one of the many excellent graduate programs in bioinformatics and computational biology that now exist. Participation in this field requires that students achieve a high level of competence not only in biology, but also in mathematics, computer science, and statistics. As a result, the program includes required courses from many different disciplines. Graduates demonstrate an above-average ability to synthesize methods from these different disciplines to solve problems. Student Learning Outcomes By completing their studies, students earning the BS degree in BCBio are expected to: 1. Develop critical thinking skills by implementing the scientific method through bioinformatics data analysis. 2. Explain and complete simple applications of the common bioinformatics and computational biology methods used for DNA, RNA, and protein analysis. 3. Understand the central dogma of biology and how bioinformatic analyses of high throughput biological next-generation sequencing proteomics datasets can help answer fundamental questions about the biology of DNA, RNA, and proteins. 4. Define systems biology and explain its importance in understanding biology; undertake basic data analyses in systems biology. 5. Identify common formats for biological data and be able to convert among different formats. 6. Summarize fundamental bioinformatics software tools, know when to apply them, and be able to use them. 7. Combine existing software tools into bioinformatic data processing pipelines. 8. Evaluate the limits of traditional algorithms and data analysis techniques as they apply to big data in biology. 9. Identify and appraise noise in high throughput biological datasets and uncertainty in the conclusions of data analysis. 10. Interpret bioinformatics and computational biology analyses individually and in collaborative learning environments. In addition to basic degree requirements listed in the Curriculum in Liberal Arts and Sciences, BCBio majors must satisfy the following requirements: A.

The Com S 227/228 course series is required for the BCBio minor. However, students transferring into the minor who have already earned credit for Com S 207/208 can substitute those courses for the Com S 227/228 series. Students will need permission of the instructors to enroll in any upper level course that requires a pre-req in Com S 227/228. Most students pursuing a minor in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology will be biology, genetics, computer science, computer engineering, statistics, or mathematics students who have already taken some of these courses for their major. The minor must include at least 9 credits that are not used to meet any other department, college, or university requirement. Graduate Study Work is offered for the master of science and doctor of philosophy degrees with a major in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB). Faculty are drawn from several departments: Agronomy; Animal Science; Astronomy and Physics; Biochemistry, Biophysics and Molecular Biology; Biomedical Sciences; Chemical and Biological Engineering; Chemistry; Computer Science; Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology; Electrical and Computer Engineering; Entomology, Genetics, Development and Cell Biology; Materials Science and Engineering; Mathematics; Plant Pathology; Statistics; Veterinary Microbiology and Preventive Medicine; and Veterinary Pathology. The BCB program emphasizes interdisciplinary training in nine related areas of focus: Bioinformatics, Computational Molecular Biology, Structural and Functional Genomics, Macromolecular Structure and Function, Metabolic and Developmental Networks, Integrative Systems Biology, information Integration and Data Mining, Biological Statistics, and Mathematical Biology. Additional information about research areas and individual faculty members is available at: www.bcb.iastate.edu. BCB students are trained to develop an independent and creative approach to science through an integrative curriculum and thesis research projects that include both computational and biological components. First year students are appointed as research assistants and participate in BCB 697 Graduate Research Rotation, working with three or more different research groups to gain experience in both “wet” (biological) and “dry” (computer) laboratory environments. In the second year, students initiate a thesis research project under the joint mentorship of two BCB faculty mentors, one from the biological sciences and one from the quantitative/computational sciences. The M.S. and Ph.D. degrees are usually completed in two and five years, respectively. Before entering the graduate BCB program, prospective BCB students should have taken courses in mathematics, statistics, computer science, biology, and chemistry. A course load similar to the following list would be considered acceptable: MATH 265 Calculus III 4 STAT 341 Introduction to the Theory of Probability and Statistics I 4 COM S 207 Fundamentals of Computer Programming 3 COM S 208 Intermediate Computer Programming 3 COM S 230 Discrete Computational Structures 3 CPR E 310 Theoretical Foundations of Computer Engineering 3 CHEM 163 College Chemistry 4 CHEM 231 Elementary Organic Chemistry 3 BBMB 301 Survey of Biochemistry 3 BIOL 313 Principles of Genetics 3 BIOL 315 Biological Evolution 3 During the first year, BCB students are required to address any background deficiencies in calculus, molecular genetics, computer science, statistics and discrete structures, with specific courses determined by prior training. Among the total course requirements for Ph.D. students are four core courses in Bioinformatics, three of which are mandatory in the BCB program: BCB 567 Bioinformatics Algorithms (mandatory) 3 BCB 568 Statistical Bioinformatics (mandatory) 3 BCB 569 Structural Bioinformatics 3 BCB 570 Systems Biology (mandatory) 3 And also should include GDCB 511 Advanced Molecular Genetics BCB 690 Student Seminar in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology BCB 691 Faculty Seminar in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology BCB 593 Workshop in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology M.S. students take the above background and core courses, take at least 6 credits of advanced coursework, and may elect to participate in fewer seminars and workshops. Additional coursework may be selected to satisfy individual interests or recommendations of the Program of Study Committee. All graduate students are encouraged to teach as part of their training for an advanced degree. (For curriculum details and sample programs of study, see: www.bcb.iastate.edu.)
