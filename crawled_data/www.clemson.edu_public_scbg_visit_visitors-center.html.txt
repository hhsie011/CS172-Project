A collaborative work of architect Keith Summerour and garden designer Ryan Gainey, the house design won awards and attracted visitors from around the country. The home was originally decorated with 85 works of art from 48 local artists, and designer Ann Platz decorated the home with furniture, antiques and decor from local shops. For the first few years of operation, the Wren House served as a Discovery Center for the Mountain Lakes Region of the South Carolina Heritage Corridor. Today, it stands as the Fran Hanson Visitor's Center, welcoming Garden and Museum visitors and showcasing destinations throughout the Upstate. Pick up a garden map, a cold drink or a garden souvenir at the Garden Gift Shop located inside of the Visitor's Center. The Fran Hanson Visitor's Center staff will help you get started on your adventure through our 295 acres of woodlands, streams, paths, niche gardens and the Bob Campbell Geology Museum.
