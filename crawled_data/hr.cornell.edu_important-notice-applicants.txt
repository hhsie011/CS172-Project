By applying for a job you agree to hold any and all of your reference sources harmless and free of any liability for releasing such information.

If you have concerns about having your current employer contacted, please communicate those concerns to the person who conducts your initial interview to determine what, if any, alternatives exist.)

If a pre-employment medical examination or immunization(s) is required, it will be stated in the recruitment advertising. By applying for a specific job, you acknowledge your understanding and agreement that failure to successfully complete a required post-offer, pre-employment medical examination or immunization(s) will result in Cornell University rescinding the employment offer or terminating your employment.
