What we missed most during lockdowns and quarantines was being in a room or space together to connect with each other and collectively experience the joy that the arts bring. With masks and proof of vaccinations and negative tests, you safely joined us for more than 100 events and adventures in the arts and humanities. We kicked off the season in August at “SPARK!,” with 5,000 students eager to begin the school year in person with music, dance, the visual arts, and more. Find yourselves in photos from this event and others that were presented during the 2021-22 season HERE. We are hard at work on the 2022-23 season of events, which will be announced in June, so watch for details. Have a wonderful summer. We look forward to seeing you again soon!
