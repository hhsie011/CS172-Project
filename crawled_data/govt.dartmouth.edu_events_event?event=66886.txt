Although varied in their form and creation, deep fakes refer to text, image, audio, or video that has been automatically synthesized by a machine-learning system. Although deep fakes add to a long line of techniques for manipulating reality, their introduction poses new opportunities and risks because of the democratized access to what would have historically been the purview of Hollywood-style studios. I will provide an overview of how synthetic media is created, how it is being used and misused, and if and how it can be perceptually and forensically distinguished from reality.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Government About Why Government?
