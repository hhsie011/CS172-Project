Image source: 1966-67 La Ventana Yearbook In 1966, four Texas Tech University "Flying Professors" started delivering a Master of Engineering program in Borger, Pampa and Midland to 78 students. The attached article from the 1966-1967 La Ventana yearbook describes this groundbreaking program which was the precursor for the Western Information Network (WIN). WIN was established in 1967 to deliver programs by closed circuit television among 18 institutions in West Texas. The first authorization to deliver instruction at an off-campus site was in 1971. Land in Kimble county near Junction was transferred from Texas A&M to Texas Tech for academic use. In 1993 Texas Tech received authority to add videotape technology for the Master of Engineering. Texas Tech University's first official Distance Learning authority was approval of the Master of Education in Educational Technology program in 1996. Kaitlin Bain, a reporter for Texas Tech's Daily Toreador newspaper, wrote an in-depth article about the "Flying Professors," interviewing Milton Smith, one of the Flying Professors from the late 1960s.
