Students in either of these populations are required to meet with an ASC academic advisor in order to access course registration. Click the links below to learn more about each student population we support.: Former Students Returning: Includes students who previously attended Clemson and have been readmitted to Clemson. AAH Undeclared Students: Includes first semester and continuing students in this pre-major who are officially assigned to us. While most other students should meet with their assigned academic advisor to discuss course registration and other academic advising needs, resources for the AAH Undeclared population may benefit students who are considering a change of major.
