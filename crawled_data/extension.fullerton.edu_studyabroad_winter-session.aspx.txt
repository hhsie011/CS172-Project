For students looking to complete course or internship credit this winter, several virtual international programs are being offered. Why do a virtual program? According to Forbes, "Even if you can’t show up in person, you can still show up—ready to learn, work and grow as a professional. With many predicting that the future of work after the pandemic will be remote, a virtual internship [or program] can be a bootcamp for the skills you’ll need—communicating effectively, operating as part of a team, meeting deadlines, asking for help, and more—for the rest of your career." For a list of virtual international programs, visit the CSUF Study Abroad Program Portal.
