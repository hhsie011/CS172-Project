Our research into networking and cybersecurity addresses both extremes. In networking, we explore novel communication service architectures to ensure correctness and scalability. To protect this infrastructure, we focus on topics including cryptocurrency, production isolation for risk mitigation, contextual authentication and authorization. Research in cybersecurity is driven by our fundamental need to protect systems and information from malicious actors and events. It focuses on a combination of network security, data analytics, and policies and procedures for dealing with potential threats.
