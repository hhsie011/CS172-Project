Two 30-seat Windows computer classrooms, iClass A and iClass B, may be reserved by faculty and staff for academic use when individual computers for class attendees are needed. Each classroom also includes an instructor's computer, which connects to a projector for classroom demonstrations, and a networked printer. Priority is given to academic special or time-critical sessions, such as testing, followed by other types of academic sessions. The classrooms can be used by faculty and staff for non-academic special sessions, but only if the classrooms are not needed for academic use. During finals week each semester, both classrooms are reserved for final exams, and cannot be used for any other purpose without special consideration. These classrooms are not available for semester-long use as a classroom, nor are they available for recurring sessions, except in exceptional cases. Students may not schedule sessions in these classrooms. Note: Food is not allowed in the classrooms, but drinks with lids are permitted. Reserve an iClassroom To reserve a classroom, faculty and staff please complete this form, with the following information: Type/topic of session Date Time Session length Number of attendees anticipated Any special needs, such as software installation. (Please note: Software will only be installed in the classrooms if requested in advance and provided by the scheduling faculty or staff member. Software must be appropriately licensed and compatible with the technology in the classrooms. Faculty and staff may not install software in the classrooms themselves.) iClassroom Coordinator Contact Janet Cairns for any questions regarding the iClassrooms. janet-cairns@utulsa.edu Last Updated: Feb 21, 2020 8:42 AM URL: https://libraries.utulsa.edu/iClass Print Page Login to LibApps Report a problem.
