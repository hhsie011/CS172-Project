After logging into the portal with your O-Key information, click on the Self-Service icon to access Self-Service. From there, you can access advisor information by clicking the Faculty Services tab in Self-Service. Alternatively, as an advisor you may click on the advisor tab rather than the Self-Service icon to access advisor links. You can also click on other tabs in the portal to access student information. One browser window will remain open for the Portal. When you click on a link from the Portal (ex: Self-Service), another browser window will open for that link. Your portal login remains active for a specified amount of time.
