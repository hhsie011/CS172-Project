We do expect that you, the applicant, however, will not participate in the drafting of your letter of recommendation. All application content is subject to verification and adherence to the above requirements. OFFERS OF ADMISSION WILL BE RESCINDED SHOULD ANY MISREPRESENTATION AND/OR OMISSION OCCUR. Transcripts A bachelor’s degree or its equivalent from an accredited institution is required for admission to Columbia Business School. Applicants should scan and submit PDF versions of transcripts from each undergraduate and graduate institution which they have attended.

Offers of admission are not binding until academic records have been verified. Back to top GPA Applicants should report their grade point average as it appears on their transcript. Back to top GMAT, Executive Assessment, or GRE Score All applicants must submit a self-reported valid GMAT, Executive Assessment, or GRE score when submitting an application. Columbia Business School considers scores to be valid for five years after your test date. Please be sure to send your score report and submit your application at least one day before the scores expire.

Columbia Business School’s GMAT and Executive Assessment code is QF8-N6-52, and its GRE code is 6442. The Admissions Committee will consider only your highest score when reviewing your application and will not combine subscores from multiple exams into a single composite score. Back to top Resume Applicants should upload their current professional resume or CV to the online application. Your professional resume or CV should ideally be one-page in length, but one-to-two pages is also acceptable. Essays Applicants must complete one short answer question and three essays. Short Answer Question: What is your immediate post-MBA professional goal? (50 characters maximum) Examples of possible responses: “Work in business development for a media company.” “Join a strategy consulting firm.” “Launch a data-management start-up.” Essay 1 Through your resume and recommendation, we have a clear sense of your professional path to date. What are your career goals over the next three to five years and what is your long-term dream job? (500 words) Essay 2 We believe Columbia Business School is a special place. CBS proudly fosters a collaborative learning environment through curricular experiences like our clusters and learning teams, co-curricular initiatives like the Phillips Pathway for Inclusive Leadership, which aims to equip students with the skills and strategies necessary to lead in an inclusive and ethical manner, and career mentorship opportunities like our Executives-in-Residence program.

Question 1 Why are you interested in obtaining a Columbia MBA in the future? (300 words maximum) Question 2 Who is a leader you admire, and why? (300 words maximum) Back to top Recommendation First-time applicants require one recommendation. Reapplicants are required to submit one new recommendation. If you have been working full-time for at least six months, your recommendation should ideally be from your current supervisor. If you are unable to secure a recommendation from your direct supervisor, please submit a statement of explanation in the Employment section of your application. Beyond your direct supervisor, other recommender options include: a former direct supervisor or another professional associate, senior to you, who can share their insights on your candidacy. If you have worked full-time for fewer than six months, your recommendation should be from a person who can comment on your managerial abilities. You may ask a summer employer or another person whom you feel can objectively assess your professional promise. If you are a college senior, we encourage you to apply for the Deferred Enrollment Program. Please note that Columbia Business School and several of our peer institutions use similar, if not identical, recommendation questions. This is an effort on our part to make the process easier for your recommender. We expect that you, the applicant, will not participate in the drafting of your recommendation. Applications are not considered complete until all required information is submitted; this includes your recommendation. We ask the recommender to consider the following guidelines when writing their recommendation (recommended limit - 1000 words): Full-Time Program How do the candidate's performance, potential, background, or personal qualities compare to those of other well-qualified individuals in similar roles? Please provide specific examples. Please describe the most important piece of constructive feedback you have given the applicant. Please detail the circumstances and the applicant's response. Deferred Enrollment Program Please share how you feel the applicant will contribute to the Columbia Business School classroom and community. Back to top Application Submitted/Received Keep in mind applications cannot be reviewed until they are complete. Missing required materials, such as your recommendation letter, must be received by the Admissions Office within two weeks of your application submission. Once we have received all required application components your application will begin the review process. During this stage, your application is reviewed by at least two admissions officers, after which you will be either invited to interview or denied admission. Please note that August-entry Regular Decision applications will not be reviewed until all January and Early Decision applications are completed, which is typically in late November. For all terms of entry, our goal is either to invite applicants for an interview or deny admission within six weeks of a completed application being received. Our goal for interviewed applicants is to render a final decision within two weeks of the interview report being completed. Back to top Interview Applicants may be invited to interview with one of our alumni. In most cases, interviews are offered in the applicant’s geographic area, and invitations to interview can be sent at any time after a completed application has been received by the Admissions Office. Interviews are by invitation only and cannot be requested. Back to top Application Fee The nonrefundable application fee for the Columbia Business School MBA Program is US$250. Applicants are strongly encouraged to pay this fee via credit card (Visa or MasterCard only) within the online application system in order to expedite the processing of their application. Applicants unable to pay by credit card should contact the Admissions Office at [email protected] for directions regarding alternative methods of payment. Fee waivers are available to full-time students, active duty US military personnel, eligible displaced persons (view this website for displaced eligibility criteria), and members of the Peace Corps or Teach For All network partners who are currently in service. Proof of current service is required. Applicants who qualify for a fee waiver should create or log into the application and navigate to the "Review" page. Upon accessing the Fee Waiver Request form, applicants will provide proof of service and explain their need for a fee waiver. Qualified applicants who have already submitted an application should email [email protected] to request a Fee Waiver Request form. Please allow up to one week for an update to your online status regarding a fee waiver request. The Application fee is automatically waived for our Deferred Enrollment Program. Back to top Re-applicant Checklist Please note that candidates may only apply once to a given term of entry. Candidates may not apply twice to the same term of entry. To reapply to the MBA Program at Columbia Business School, please use the following checklist to ensure smooth processing. Please note, information and requirements are subject to change without notice. The Admissions Office retains all applications for one year after a decision is rendered. If you are reapplying no more than 12 months from your initial term of entry to Columbia Business School, the checklist below will help ensure that you submit everything the Admissions Committee will need to reassess your candidacy. For example if you applied for August 2021 you will be considered a reapplicant for January 2022 or August 2022. If you are reapplying more than 12 months after the initial term of entry, you must submit a new, fully complete application. Please submit the following to the Admissions Committee for your reapplication. If you have trouble starting a new application, please contact the Admissions Office for assistance. Reapplication fee: US$250. One new recommendation letter, preferably from your current employer.

Submit transcripts of any additional courses you have taken since your previous application.
