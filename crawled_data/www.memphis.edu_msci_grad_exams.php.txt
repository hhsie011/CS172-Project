Exams are typically administered at the beginning of the Fall and Spring semesters. Students are expected to take Abstract Algebra (MATH 7261-7262) and Real Analysis (Math 7350-7351) before attempting the qualifying exams. Exceptions may be granted by the Graduate Committee in very special situations. Students wishing to take the qualifying exams should consult with their advisors who will make the necessary arrangements with Dr. Pei-Kee Lin. The Ph.D. comprehensive exam in Mathematics consists of two parts: the completion of the qualifying exam (both the algebra and the analysis components) and a talk on a topic with potential for advanced research. This talk must be announced to the department and evaluated by a committee of at least three faculty members. Upon completion of these two parts, the comprehensive exam results form should be sent to the Graduate School.

Students are strongly advised to identify suitable faculty members early on. Students wishing to present a project should submit the title and a brief description of the project (one paragraph) to Prof. Gisèle Goldstein by September 30 in the fall semester and January 30 in the spring semester. Statistics Concentration: The comprehensive master’s exam is a written exam covering the following topics: MATH 6636 - Intro Statistical Theory, MATH 7654 - Inference Theory plus two additional courses as described in the Graduate Catalog Teaching of Mathematics Concentration: The comprehensive master’s exam is a written exam covering topics from four courses, each consisting of at least three credit hours of course work as described in the Graduate Catalog. Students wishing to take the written comprehensive master’s exam in the Statistics or Teaching of Mathematics concentrations should consult with their advisors who will make the necessary arrangements with Prof. Pei-Kee Lin.
