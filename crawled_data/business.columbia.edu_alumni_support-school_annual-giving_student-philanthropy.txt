Through participation in University-wide events, such as Columbia Giving Day, and School-wide initiatives, such as gift campaigns and donor stewardship events, current students witness firsthand the impact that alumni giving has on the ability of the School to realize its greatest ambitions. By interacting with donors and professional fundraising staff, students develop a philanthropic mindset that will persist long after graduation.
