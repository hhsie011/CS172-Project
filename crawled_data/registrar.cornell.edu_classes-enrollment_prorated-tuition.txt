The student must: Be enrolled in nine or fewer credit hours. Be in the ninth (or equivalent) and final semester of their degree program. Be in good academic standing with their school or college. Clear holds that prevent registration by the end of the third week of classes. Have completed the residency requirements for their degree program. College and department specific conditions, policies, and exceptions may apply. Students who meet these criteria may contact their college registrar regarding the application process. Applications must be submitted no later than the end of the third week of classes in the semester in which proration is requested. Applications received after that time will not be considered. Students cannot exceed the number of credits approved or full-time tuition will be charged. No refund will be allowed if the student takes fewer than the approved number of credits. Approval of the student's advisor and college registrar is required for all requests. Approval is conditional until grades are finalized for the semester immediately preceding the semester for which prorated tuition is requested. If final grades indicate more than the approved number of credits is required for graduation, the application to prorate tuition must be reconsidered. In the case where graduation requirements are not met during the semester of prorated tuition, full tuition will be charged for subsequent study at Cornell during the fall or spring semester. All applicants for prorated tuition should be aware of the possible impact that this enrollment status may have on financial aid, student loans, scholarships, on-campus employment, health insurance, or other considerations. It is the responsibility of the student to resolve these situations prior to submitting this application. For each credit hour taken, the student will be charged one-twelfth of the full tuition for the semester. Students should direct questions about eligibility for proration of tuition to their school or college registrar.
