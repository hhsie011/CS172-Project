We value scholastic environments and opportunities that enhance academic success. Recognizing that academic and student affairs collaborations support such success, we encourage intentional interactions or integration of residential education efforts with student persistence and success efforts. Types of partnerships Support Exchange Cooperation Collaboration Commencing engagement at a lower level, focus is on the immediate rather than the long-term in services, facility use, and/or funding. Types of programs include use of academic spaces for student organization meetings, one-time space or facility usage, and sponsorship of on-campus students to attend a program/event. Units engage in a partnership that results in a mutually beneficial exchange beyond facilities and funding, but does not constitute a long-term, coordinated relationship between the units. Types of programs include inviting faculty/staff to speak at/attend events, inviting student affairs staff to speak at/attend other events, and other one-time uses of someone’s expertise. Units engage in a coordinated relationship where roles are designated by independent expertise and responsibilities are shared over a long-term, recurring relationship between units. Types of programs include advisory boards, advisory committees, and task forces. Units share full responsibility in an integrated partnership that includes planning and researching, financing, decision-making, coordinating, and assessing a project or experience. This partnership is often a long-term and sustained coordinated relationship that is mutually beneficial for the units. Types of programs include study-abroad programs, internships/assistantships, joint research and project engagement, and shared staff with academic areas. Current partnerships Our campus collaborators make transformative experiences possible in our residential communities. Below are our current campus collaborators and their respective collaborations.
