Students become generalist social work professionals able to work with individuals, families, groups, communities, and organizations in enhancing the health, well being, and empowerment of disadvantaged communities across the lifespan. Graduates may pursue social work practice jobs, or graduate education in social work, or a range of other fields (e.g., law, medicine, public policy, international development). Students receive an interdisciplinary liberal arts education, drawing on a range of social science courses which prepare them to promote human welfare and deal with complex social problems. Students are involved in both academic coursework (gaining intellectual knowledge and critical thinking skills) and a field placement experience ("lived" or "on the ground" experience). The following outcomes define the BASW program: Preparation of entry-level baccalaureate social workers for generalist practice in a multicultural context. Education and training of generalist social workers who are informed, engaged, and responsive practitioners, able to understand and take action in enhancing human welfare and in promoting social and economic justice. Education of students within the context of an interdisciplinary liberal arts education, to foster a comparative and critical examination of social welfare and social work through the study of its history, policies, research, and practice interventions. Preparation for graduate education. In addition, the School of Social Work houses a number of centers and projects. For more information on these research activities, see department website.

Back to Top Program of Study: Master Of Social Work Program Overview The School of Social Work offers a Master of Social Work degree with three options: a two-year full-time program; a one-year advanced-standing program for qualified students with a degree in social work/social welfare from a Council on Social Work Education accredited undergraduate program; and a three-year part-time extended degree program. All program options prepare students for advanced professional practice with a culturally diverse range of at-risk populations in publicly funded social services. The curriculum encompasses two distinct but interconnected areas: the beginning content or professional foundation, and opportunities for advanced content in areas of policy, services, and methods. The professional foundation provides instruction in the basic knowledge and skills required for effective, generalist social work practice, as well as socialization to the profession, its value orientation, ethics, and history. The advanced curriculum provides in-depth knowledge and skills needed for advanced practice in the social work profession. The advanced curriculum is being revised.
