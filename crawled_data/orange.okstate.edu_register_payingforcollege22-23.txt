Student Information Student First Name Student Last Name Email Please indicate your residency status for tuition purposes. In-state ResidentOut of State Step 1. Costs OSU creates cost estimates to be used for student financial aid purposes and is not necessarily the amount you will pay out of pocket. Some costs (such as tuition and fees) are set; others are influenced by personal choices, so be sure you know your anticipated costs and plan accordingly. Estimate your costs for nine months (August to May). All cost figures are average estimates. Tuition/fee figures reflect final rates approved by the OSU A&M Board of Regents and the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education in June 2021. If you would like to estimate your own costs, you can enter values in the My Estimates column to see how they compare against the OSU estimate. Housing & Meal Options Do you plan to live on-campus or off-campus? Entering freshmen are required to live on-campus during their first year at OSU. I plan to live in the residence halls.I plan to live off-campus or in a Greek chapter. Do you plan to purchase an OSU meal plan? YesNo Your housing and meal costs vary by your personal choices. Use the options below to select different housing/meal options to populate the "My Estimate" fields below. Housing and meal plan costs reflect the 2020-2021 approved rates and are subject to change.

Be sure you know the store’s buy-back policy on textbooks. Bring your bike to college or use “The Bus” (OSU’s FREE bus system on-campus and in-town). Treat your Student ID card like a bank card. Review your OSU Student Account online at least once a week. You can control how much you spend on internet, video games, vacations, Netflix/Hulu, and coffee and other optional items. Create a budget and stick to it!
