Each survey offers household-based HIV counseling and testing conducted by trained survey staff, with return of results. The surveys also ask questions about access to preventive care and treatment services for adults and children. The results measure national and regional progress toward UNAIDS’ 90-90-90 goals and guide policy and funding priorities.
