This core series is supported by electives in biomedical mechanics, imaging and instrumentation, biomaterials and tissue engineering. An introductory freshman course (BME 1310) provides an overview of the breadth of BME. The core courses for the minor are taught by tenure-track faculty in BME. Instruction for associated laboratories is performed by a senior lecturer (Dr. Shivaun Archer). This minor allows students to build expertise in quantitative engineering analysis of human biology, physiology, and pathology that complements their major discipline training for a broad range of industrial, academic, and professional careers. To apply to the BME minor, contact the BME Undergraduate Coordinator in 121 Weill Hall, bmeugrad@cornell.edu.

The recommended sequence for admission to the M.Eng. BME will be two courses from Category 1 and 2, as well as BME 3010, 3020, 4010, and 4020. The M.Eng. BME program will require a knowledge of molecular and cellular BME, and of BME analysis of physiological systems.
