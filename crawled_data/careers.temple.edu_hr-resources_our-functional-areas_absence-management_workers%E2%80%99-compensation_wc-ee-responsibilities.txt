Every occupational illness and/or injury must be reported, regardless of how minor. These reports will be investigated to ensure the receipt of medical and/or disability benefits due the employee. Injured at Work If you are injured while working, you are required to report your injury to your supervisor immediately, even if you do not require medical treatment. You will be asked to complete an incident report form outlining the specifics of the incident. Complete your portion of the Workers’ Compensation Incident Report Form. You can get the form from your supervisor, Employee Health Services, Occupational Health Services or by reaching out to the Absence Management Department. Reporting the Incident Employees must report any work-related illness or injury to their supervisor so that the supervisor can arrange for immediate medical care if needed (including transportation), complete all required reports and documents in a timely and accurate manner, and report the incident to the Absence Management Department. The employee is required to complete the following Temple University forms. Your supervisor will provide you these forms. Incident Report Form, and Employee Rights and Responsibilities Form. The Employee Rights and Responsibility form can also be accessed via the University Forms channel under the Staff Tools tab in TUportal. Using the search function, you can search by form name, office, department, school/college and/or category. The completed forms can be returned to the Absence Management Department via fax at (215) 926-2274 or email workcomp@temple.edu.
