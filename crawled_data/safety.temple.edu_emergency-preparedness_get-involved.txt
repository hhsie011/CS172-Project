Join us in our effort to build a culture of preparedness and a disaster-resilient university. The Building Emergency Management Team (BEMT) is a critical force of staff, faculty and students who guide the community during emergency procedures. Anyone can become part of the BEMT, and we host special skills training, social events and an annual banquet to develop relationships and enhance collaboration. During real-world emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, we sometimes need to look to our campus community for volunteers. Temple University would need volunteers for various kinds of emergency activations, such as mass sheltering, vaccine or medical distribution, and disaster mental health outreach. We welcome faculty, staff and students to learn more about how to join a roster of volunteers for disasters and emergencies that impact Temple. Other opportunities to get involved with the TUready community at Temple include volunteering for preparedness events, such as the TUready Fair or Resilience Fair, being part of emergency functional exercises, including active assailant scenarios and public health emergency simulations, and joining in on other special sessions. Building Emergency Management Team (BEMT) The BEMT is made up of university staff and faculty volunteers who help guide members of the Temple community during emergency procedures such as evacuation, shelter-in-place, and lockdown. Emergency Volunteers Volunteers are called upon during real-world emergencies, including mass vaccination, mass sheltering or disaster responses. All members of the Temple community are welcome to volunteer with us.
