Breadcrumb Home Benefits Savings & Perks Sub Navigation In This Section Insurance Banking & Credit Cards Branded Items Maddock Alumni Center Brick Walkway Leave your mark on campus. Literally. Amid the gardens of the Maddock Alumni Center grounds is an elegant brick walkway centerpiece. When you add your name—or the name of any alumnus or alumna you wish to honor—you are making a $250 tax-deductible gift to the Brown Alumni Association. Your gift will directly support programs and services that enrich the lives of Brown alumni. How it works Orders are accepted throughout the year. We are restricted to one name per brick and a maximum of 18 characters per line. (Long names may appear on two lines). The final line contains the class year(s). Sorry, no nicknames allowed! Any student can be approved for a brick as long as they matriculated. Parents or grandparents of a student may also buy a brick. Bricks for Brown alums who are related to one another can be placed together upon request, so long as it doesn’t mean moving others. All bricks are mapped on a grid, kept in a binder at the Maddock Alumni Center. To see your brick in person after it’s installed, simply stop by Maddock and ask for help finding it. Or better yet, call +1 (401) 863-3307 or email brickwalkway@brown.edu ahead of time and Alumni Relations staff will give you the location and a map. Celebrate your connection to College Hill You left a piece of your heart at Brown University. Now leave your name. Use our secure online order form and purchase your brick today.
