Previously, Dr. Pennell was Chair of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Tufts University, and the Bernard M. Gordon Senior Faculty Fellow in Environmental Engineering. Prior to moving to Tufts, Dr. Pennell was a Professor in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology and held an adjunct faculty appointment in the Department of Neurology at the Emory University School of Medicine. Dr. Pennell’s research addresses soil and groundwater remediation, engineered nanomaterials, and environmental toxicology. His current research projects focus on the remediation of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), environmental exposure metabolomics, and the use of engineered nanomaterials for subsurface characterization. Dr. Pennell has published over 160 referred journal articles and book chapters, is a registered Professional Engineer (PE), a Board Certified Environmental Engineer (BCEE), a Fellow of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), and a Fellow of the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors (AEESP). Dr. Pennell served on the review committee for the Orica Botany Groundwater Cleanup Project in Sydney Australia (2020) and the United Nations Compensation Committee for the 1st Gulf War (2008-2014). He was a member of the National Research Council Committee on the Nation’s Groundwater (2010-2013), which authored “Alternatives for Managing the Nation's Complex Contaminated Groundwater Sites”. Dr. Pennell currently serves as co-chair on the organizing committee for the Remediation Technology Summit (RemTec) (2019-), and recently served as a panelist on the National Academy of Science Engineering and Medicine, and the Environmental Health Matters Initiative workshop on PFAS (2019).
