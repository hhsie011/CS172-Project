The health promotion and education minor provides students with a basic framework of knowledge and skills regarding the health promotion and education profession. The minor allows students with an interest in health promotion to incorporate formal coursework into their existing major. Health educators work to improve the health of individuals or communities, depending on their work setting and job responsibilities. For example, health educators working in health departments often are concerned with the health of the community they serve and may develop programs to impact people living in the community. Health educators working in business/industry may be working one-on-one with individuals to help them modify and improve their diet, increase their physical activity, reduce their stress levels, stop smoking, etc. The seven basic responsibilities of health educators include: assessing individual and community needs for health education planning health education strategies, interventions and programs implementing health education strategies, interventions and programs conducting evaluation and research related to health education administering health education strategies, interventions and programs serving as a health education resource person communicating and advocating for health and health education Admission Requirements Students must be matriculated and seeking a bachelor's degree to obtain this minor. At least 50 percent of the minor curriculum must be completed through CECH. Students must have a 2.0 university GPA to be admitted to the minor. Success right arrow down arrow Students pursuing a minor in health promotion and education have a wide variety of academic interests and talents. Many of our students want to combine their existing major such as social work, psychology, dietetics, Africana studies, or organizational leadership with a background in health promotion and education. Having this additional knowledge base in health promotion theory and practice provides another avenue for students to put their passions and ideas into action and increase career opportunities. Careers right arrow down arrow Health educators work in a variety of settings including public health departments, non-profit organizations, fitness centers, hospitals, and insurance companies.
