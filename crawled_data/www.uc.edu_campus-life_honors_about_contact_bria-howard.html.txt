Student Affairs in Higher Education, Miami University B.S. Family & Child Studies, Miami University A little about me... Hello! I was born in Warren, Ohio, but grew up in Columbus, and I currently reside in Finneytown! I received my B.S and M.S at Miami University where I studied Family & Child Studies and Student Affairs in Higher Education. I did a short stint of 2 years in Indiana at Taylor University where I worked with a scholarship program called Act Six in the Office of Intercultural Programs. College students and campuses bring me joy because there is so much life and the spirit of endless possibilities present. It is a place of growth, the broadening of perspectives and the continuation of one’s story that happens. For that, I am thankful I get to call this cultivation my work. I enjoy reading books and having conversations about food (specifically cheese), intersectionality, feminism, systematic disruption/change and racial identity development. When people ask me what I do for fun, I panic because fun to me is re-watching old episodes of the Golden Girls and hanging out with my retired parents. I LOVE pop culture, more specifically The Shade Room’s Instagram account, and I think/feel in memes. I strongly believe that Cardi B is the people’s champion and that Blue Ivy (Beyoncé’s daughter) will be the President one day. I currently advise DAAP, CCM, and CAHS students! Stop in and say hi! Ask me about...
