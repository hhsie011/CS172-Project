The primary objective of the business continuity program is to identify and protect the critical operational functions that allow the University to accomplish its mission of educating students and conducting research. By developing detailed recovery plans, departments identify processes and recovery strategies that minimize or eliminate the amount of time and expense required to resume normal operations following an unexpected disruption. Business continuity planning is facilitated by the Office of Risk Management and Safety. For more information contact 574-631-5037.
