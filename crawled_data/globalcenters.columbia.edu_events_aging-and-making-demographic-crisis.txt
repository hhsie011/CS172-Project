8:00 PM Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai, 12-13, Maker Chambers VI, First floor, Jamnalal Bajaj Road, Nariman Point, Mumbai 400 021 Show Map As part of its ongoing Public Health Series, Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai invites you to a presentation on the politics of aging, featuring Professor Kavita Sivaramkrishnan from the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. The aging of populations worldwide is being projected as a 'grey Tsunami' and socio-economic crisis. Just as fears of a 'population explosion' in the 1980s revealed a concern about too many dependent children on the planet to feed; population aging is projected as the burden of caring for large numbers of dependent, aged persons. For non-western societies like India, where life expectancy has increased over a few decades, longevity was traditionally considered a mark of progress, and of successful public health and welfare provisions; it is now being viewed as a challenge, even 'peril’ for a growing economy. Based on her new book, As the World Ages: The Making of a Demographic Crisis, Dr. Sivaramakrishnan’s presentation will challenge these assumptions from a historical and policy perspective, and explore a recent history of how old age and aging populations began to be defined, represented and projected by researchers and international experts in the West and at the United Nations. She will discuss how Western gerontological knowledge and practices have circulated and been recast by local experts and activists in India and parts of the Global South. The presentation will be followed by a panel discussion, featuring leading experts in the field of Gerontology, Dr. Mohan Rao and Dr. Perianayagam Arokiasamy. The panel will address challenges that lie ahead, and how we can shape aging in our societies and make it meaningful through local priorities, norms, and experiences.
