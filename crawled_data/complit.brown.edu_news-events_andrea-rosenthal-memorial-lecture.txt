Dr. Young H. Moon, father of Edward ’92 and Gerald ’94, made a further gift to underwrite this endowment. About Andrea Rosenthal Andrea Rosenthal graduated from Brown University in 1988, with a degree in Art History. She also took many courses in Comparative Literature, and inspired by her studies of Japanese literature, she went to Japan after graduation. On the evening of December 21, 1988, Andrea was on her way home for Christmas vacation. Along with 269 others, including three other Brown undergraduates, she was killed in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
