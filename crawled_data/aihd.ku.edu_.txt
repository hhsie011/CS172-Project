American Indian Health and Diet Project since 2006 The goals of the AIHDP are to bring to light the health problems faced by indigenous peoples, to understand how we came to our unhealthy situations and what we can do about them. You will find no fry bread recipes here! This site also focuses on connecting with the natural world, how to extablish backyard and butterfly gardens, and how to prepare delicious meals with nutritious ingredients you can grow yourself, or purchase from farmers' markets. You do not have to be a chef! Historically, we ate simply and we should continue that tradition. This website is based on my book, Recovering Our Ancestors’ Gardens: Indigenous Recipes and Guide to Diet and Fitness. University of Nebraska Press, 2005. Now being revised and expanded, including a curriculum guide! This book won the Special Award of the Jury of the Gourmand World Cookbook Awards (along with Martha Stewart and Maya Angelou) and was Finalist for Best in the World Cookbook. Also see my Facebook page, Indigenous Eating, for more food ideas. Lots of new dishes!
