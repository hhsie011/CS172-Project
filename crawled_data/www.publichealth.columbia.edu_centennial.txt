Celebrating the Centennial A century ago, Columbia University made a bold commitment to help shape the study and practice of public health. In 1922, we began with a single student, in a single room on West 59th Street. Since then, the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health has educated generations of leaders, led groundbreaking scientific discovery, and delivered solutions to protect and improve the health and wellbeing of people everywhere. Recent events have made clear what many of us have long known. The work of the Columbia Mailman School is indispensable. From navigating the COVID-19 crisis and understanding the health effects of climate change to reducing health inequities in this country and around the world, Mailman’s experts are leading the way on the issues that matter. As we mark this centennial, let us celebrate the school and its students, faculty, and staff for their tireless and courageous efforts to protect our collective health. Lee C.
