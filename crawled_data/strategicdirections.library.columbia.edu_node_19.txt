In all, we convened more than a dozen Provost’s Advisory Committee on the Libraries meetings, two Student Library Advisory Committee meetings, thirteen Ear-to-the-Ground meetings for all CUL staff, and an All-Staff Gathering. We had conversations with the Senate Libraries Committee and the Senate Student Affairs Committee, and we devoted more than half of our CUL Management Committee meetings to Strategic Directions discussion. Taken together, the comments of hundreds of staff, faculty, and students resulted in a rich outpouring of thought about CUL today as well as our ambitions for CUL's future. We thank all of our staff and constituencies for their enthusiastic interest and contributions to our Strategic Directions process and especially the following individuals and groups who were instrumental in the success of our yearlong process.
