It thereby provides a powerful tool to assess key aspects of brain metabolism and function. The repertoire of measurable compounds along with the quantitative character of the derived information makes MRS a versatile tool for the identification of clinical conditions, for longitudinal patient monitoring and for treatment control and monitoring of virtually all disorders with a metabolic signature.
