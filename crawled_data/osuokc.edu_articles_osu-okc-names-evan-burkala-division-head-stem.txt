Dr. Burkala grew up in Perth, Australia, where he completed a B.Sc. in Biotechnology at Murdoch University. He went on to complete a Ph.D. in Veterinary Studies at Murdoch studying viral infections of cattle. In 2001, he moved to the USA and performed research at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln on HIV infection. He then moved to Montana to perform research at the University of Montana in Missoula on viral infections in cougars and other genetic studies. The move to Oklahoma brought him to the University of Oklahoma Health Science Center to research HIV and immunity until he gained employment at OSU-OKC in the Science Department. Dr. Burkala has been teaching Microbiology at OSU-OKC for 11 years and was the Department Head of Science since 2012. Dr. Burkala loves to travel and has been to many places around the globe. Europe and Asia are some of his favorite parts of the world, but he still calls Australia home. He doesn't get to go back as often as he’d like, especially since COVID, and he misses Australia. "Despite what most people around here think, not everything in Australia is trying to kill you," Burkala said. He encourages everyone to travel to places they thought they’d never go. "A world perspective is important for everyone and you’ll see that people are people, no matter where you go," Burkala said. Burkala is excited to help move the STEM Division forward as the new Division Head. "Student success is the central role of OSU-OKC, and the opportunity to lead the STEM Division to help students find rewarding careers is exciting," he said. "The programs we have, including Power Transmission and Distribution Technology, Construction, and Surveying, give students a 'work-ready' education. Our science classes are led by highly educated people that know how to reach our students and are invested in their education. I will work hard to fight for our students, faculty, and staff to keep OSU-OKC a quality institution that makes employers seek out our graduates."
