Each year, more than 350 million dollars in aid is awarded to students. Students receive aid in the form of scholarships, grants, work study, and loans. FSU offers admission on a need-blind basis. To be considered for financial aid you must complete the 2022-2023 Free Application for Student Aid (FAFSA). The application opened October 21, 2021. You should complete it no later than December 1 for priority consideration. Students admitted for the summer term should complete the 2021-2022 AND the 2022-2023 FAFSA. Resources to help students navigate the financial aid process can be found on the Financial Aid and Student Business Services websites. Once the FAFSA is processed by the government, you will be sent a document called a Student Aid Report (SAR). It's important that you check your SAR for accuracy. This data will be used to determine your eligibility for need-based aid.
