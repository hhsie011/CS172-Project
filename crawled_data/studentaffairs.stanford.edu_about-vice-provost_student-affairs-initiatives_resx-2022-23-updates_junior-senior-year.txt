So far, it is working! This year, the Row is 93% juniors and older as opposed to 75% in the 2019-2020 academic year (84% when you look at non-fraternity and sorority houses for 2019-2020). 80% of residents in apartment housing (EVGR-A, Suites, and Mirrielees) are juniors and older. What’s Next More Flexibility: We will be switching this year’s all-soph housing to upperclass housing to give you more options to live in your neighborhood. If you are assigned to apartment style housing (EVGR-A or Mirrielees) next year, you will be able to select any apartment within the building instead of being restricted to specific floors/ floor segments. This will allow seniors to have access to the best apartments in all of EVGR-A and Mirrielees (after disability accommodation assignments). Friends from other neighborhoods are also able to be neighbors. (Apartments will be assigned by neighborhood.) Also, as we are able, we will work to decrease the number of triples in Mirrielees and EVGR-A.
