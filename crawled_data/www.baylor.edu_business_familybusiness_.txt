The course explores the complexities of small/privately held firm management and introduces some unique challenges of mixing family and business. A variety of research-based and practitioner-tested best practices are offered. Students are exposed to numerous case studies and guest speakers. Internships We also seek a wide range of internship opportunities with family businesses. Internships are typically semester-long relationships that afford students valuable experience working in successful family business environments. Family firms may benefit from the program by using the internship program to prescreen employees, participate in family to family exchanges, have their next generation experience another family business or to gain fresh ideas and insights from a newly minted Baylor Bear! Future In the future, we will expand our undergraduate course offerings, add graduate level courses at the MBA and EMBA level, continuing education courses to benefit family business owners and advisors, and eventually offer online modules. Students will be able to earn a certificate of family business management. Entrepreneurship majors will be able to earn a family business concentration.
