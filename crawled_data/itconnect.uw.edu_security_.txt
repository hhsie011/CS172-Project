Your personal UW NetID verifies who you are, ensures the privacy of your personal information, and restricts the use of UW resources to authorized users. Faculty and staff can use Shared UW NetIDs to further their research, collaborate on group projects, and expedite any academic or administrative work at the UW. Shared UW NetID accounts are designed to supplement your individual account for facilitating your work activities. Some people may need an Admin UW NetID, which is used to provide a more limited context for an ID used for administering a set of workstations, servers, or a domain. While UW NetIDs are based on an affiliation with the University of Washington, individuals who are not otherwise eligible for a UW NetID may be able to get a Sponsored UW NetID if they are sponsored by a current UW faculty or staff member.
