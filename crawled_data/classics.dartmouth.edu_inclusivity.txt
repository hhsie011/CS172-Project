This commitment is linked to our belief in the value of ensuring the creative power of everyone, of making sure that diverse talent is represented and fully voiced in our community. This, we believe, makes us better, makes us stronger. It helps foster richer classroom experiences and better scholarship. We also believe it contributes to creating a better and more inclusive society, one in which everyone has the opportunity to participate fully. We recognize that diversity is complex and intersectional, including ethnic, racial, gender, class, and religious identities as well as diverse life and career experiences. We further recognize that diversity does not necessarily correlate with or produce equality; nevertheless, we commit to a more diverse field in our Departmental practices and in our curriculum. We commit to a curriculum that reflects our values. Most of our courses are designed with a view to developing an analytical engagement with and recognition of historically and culturally different peoples. Such analytical perspective is required for the successful study of the ancient world – an ethnically, racially, religiously diverse cultural composite. The study of the ancient world, we believe, provides an apt opportunity for our students to think carefully about cultural differences and how to understand them also in our time – both in our own society and globally, where respectful engagement with culturally diverse peoples is a given and the capacity to engage respectfully and learn from diverse peoples is a necessity for success. The Department has a historical commitment to expanding the curriculum to engage with the ancient world in its complexity and to explore the influence of classical culture in contemporary contexts. Our faculty regularly teach in the general, global Humanities program for first-year students, the Women and Gender Studies Program; our faculty participate in the Feminist Inquiry Seminar, the Comparative Slavery Reading group, and the Race and Migration Studies group. Our scholarship and teaching have addressed issues of gender and sexuality, of slavery and enforced cultural subordination, and of the appropriation of classical culture by subordinated groups. The Department has long-term participation with professional associations and groups working for social justice, particularly Women's Classical Caucus, Classics and Social Justice, and Lambda Classical Caucus. Faculty have received national recognition for community outreach work, bringing our expertise out of the academy and into the community in the service of social good. The Department is committed to continued revisions of our curriculum and research priorities to broaden the viewpoints and experiences represented in our intellectual community. We are also devoted to continued work for a more diverse field in our commitment to our students.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Classics Curriculum Overview Course Offerings by Term Fall 2021 Winter 2022 Spring 2022 Summer 2022 Fall 2022 Winter 2023 Spring 2023 2023-24 Classical Studies Courses Entry points for Classical Studies Literature, Philosophy, Religion Ancient History Classical Archaeology Language Study -- Latin Latin Classes Placement in Latin Language Study -- Ancient Greek Courses in Ancient Greek Placement in Ancient Greek Majors and Minors Classical Studies track Ancient History track Classical Archaeology track Classical Languages and Literature track Culminating Experience Foreign Study NEW Classics FSP in Spring 2022 Greece Foreign Study Program Rome Foreign Study Program Projects & Awards Classics-Related Projects and Awards Student Research Archaeological Fieldwork Reid/Wiencke Funding for Research Senior Honors Projects Awards & Prizes Faculty Media Projects Annual Lecture Programs Faculty Books Inclusivity News & Events People Our graduates Graduating with a Classics Degree Alumni Support Tell Us Your Story Alumni Stories My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
