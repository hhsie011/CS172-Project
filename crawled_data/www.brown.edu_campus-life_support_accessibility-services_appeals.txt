Disability Discrimination: Reporting Concerns, Informal Resolution and Formal Appeal Procedures Students may appeal the denial of an accommodation request through the University's ADA/Section 504 Coordinator as soon as practicable upon receipt of the denial. The appeal must detail, in writing, a full description of the individual's concern, including the facts that support an accommodation approval, efforts made to resolve the concern through Student Accessibility Services and any other information relevant to the determination (including supporting documentation). Through the submission of an appeal, the appealing party authorizes the release of their accommodation related health information to the ADA/Section 504 Coordinator (or their designee). Please note, this is a confidential process and health information will not be shared beyond what is nessecary to process the appeal. Upon receipt of the appeal, the ADA/Section 504 Coordinator will review the denial by evaluating all relevant information and will make a determination regarding the matter. At their discretion, the ADA/Section 504 Coordinator may meet with the appealing party or other individuals with knowledge of the relevant facts. The ADA/Section 504 Coordinator will issue a written decision in response to the appeal. Brown University's ADA/Section 504 Coordinator can be reached at: [email protected] The ADA/Section 504 Coordinator will consider the following factors during their review: · whether designated procedures were followed; · if the appropriate information was utilized, reasonably considered, and supports the denial; · whether the individual and the University engaged in an interactive dialogue; · whether the requested accommodation poses an undue burden on the University; · and any other factors the ADA/Section 504 Coordinator determines to be relevant to the matter. The ADA/Section 504 Coordinator will have the final determination in all appeals cases and if applicable will notify all relevant parties.
