On 17 November 2016, nearly 200 countries attending the COP22 to the UNFCCC adopted the Marrakech Action Proclamation for Our Climate and Sustainable Development, calling for the highest political commitment to fight against global warming. The achievement in climate change has provided a major breakthrough in global governance. However, the world’s change of political landscape adds to the uncertainty in the implementation of the Paris Agreement and challenges facing by international cooperation, demanding a reevaluation of the future of international climate governance. Is progress still possible for the U.S. under the new administration? Could the Paris Agreement withstand the risk of a possible global diplomatic backlash? Would there be a new world order in climate governance? On November 30, the Brookings-Tsinghua Center, Caixin Video and Columbia Global Center | Beijing will co-host a public event on The future of global governance and climate action in a changing political landscape. The event will be in Chinese with simultaneous translation. We warmly welcome you to join us for the discussion.
