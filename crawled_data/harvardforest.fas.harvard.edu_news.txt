Thus began their 11-week Summer Research Program internships, during which they will pursue mentored team projects on topics ranging from amplifying Indigenous voices in STEM to understanding controls on forest carbon sequestration. The program, now April 3, 2022 New Study and Interactive Map Point to Environmental Justice Disparities (and Solutions) in Land Conservation A new study in Environmental Research Letters shows striking disparities in the distribution of conserved land across multiple dimensions of social marginalization in New England – and creates a tool to help address them. In a New England-wide analysis, the researchers found that communities in the lowest income quartile, and communities with the highest proportions of people of color February 16, 2022 Study: Forest Edges Store More Carbon than We Knew Explore the Boston University research feature: City Trees and Soil Are Sucking More Carbon Out of the Atmosphere Than Previously Thought Read the WBUR story: Urban Forests May Store More Carbon than We Knew Photo of Luca Morreale collecting data at a forest edge in the Arnold Arboretum, by Sarah Garvey February 16, 2022 2/22 Webinar on Open Positions in Lab Management, Education The Forest is accepting applications for 2 open positions in education and laboratory coordination. The full-time Higher Education and Laboratory Coordinator will manage the year-round work of the Forest's Summer Research Program and also coordinate activities across multiple laboratories, a greenhouse, and experimental gardens. The part-time Schoolyard Ecology Program Coordinator will manage the year-round work of the Forest's K-12 Schoolyard Ecology February 15, 2022 Museum Panorama Honors Nipmuc Land Stewardship & Collaboration A new panorama in the Fisher Museum is the culmination of a year-long collaboration between community organizer Nia Holley of the Nipmuc Nation, multimedia artist Roberto Mighty, HF Director of Outreach & Education Clarisse Hart, the Vermont-based design company Shadows & Light, and the Wilmington-based printing company Advanced Imaging. The photograph, spanning a 24-foot wall in the museum, February 15, 2022 Video Series Offers Snapshots of Long-Term HF Research A new video series showcases current field research by senior scientists, post-doctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduates in the Harvard Forest Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Program. The series was filmed in summer 2021 by filmmaker and longtime Harvard Forest collaborator, Roberto Mighty.

Watch February 15, 2022 Even in Retirement, Ellison Achieves Aaron Ellison retired from Harvard Forest in July 2021 after 20 years as Harvard's Senior Research Fellow in Ecology. From 2018 - 2021, he also served as the Deputy Director of the Harvard Forest. In retirement, Ellison has continued to achieve high honors in ecology, in August 2021﻿ accomplishing his career-long goal of publishing a Princeton Monograph in his January 31, 2022 Winter Interns Explore US Forest Cover, Indigenous Partnerships, Museum Communication Four Harvard students completed intensive winter internships at the Forest this January, working virtually on a range of projects and presenting their findings to community partners and Harvard faculty and staff on January 19. Nina Chung, a junior studying Integrative Biology, worked with mentors Jonathan Thompson and Valerie Pasquarella to compare the sensitivity of remote sensing products January 19, 2022 Study Tracks Seasonal Growth and Water Shortage in Trees By Anna Christensen A paper published this past summer in Tree Physiology finds that tree species of varying wood-porosity experience peak growth at different times of the year, exposing some species to more intense water shortages than others. The wood-porosity of a tree refers to the structure of its vessels—pipelines within the trunk that carry sap throughout the tree. Some trees such as January 7, 2022 Study Reveals Impact of Colonial Land Use on Current Forest Composition By Anna Christensen A study just published in PeerJ Life and Environment examines how anthropogenic and natural disturbances from past decades, and even centuries, affect the spatial and species composition of woody plants within a forest plot.
