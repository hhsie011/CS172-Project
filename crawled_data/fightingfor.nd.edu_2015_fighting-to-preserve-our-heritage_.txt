Across the globe, many important cultural heritage monuments face the real threat of ruin by human or natural disaster. Scholars at Notre Dame are helping to ensure the preservation of these treasures. Architecture professor Krupali Krusche has launched a Digital Historical Architecture Research and Material Analysis (DHARMA) initiative, which is mapping World Heritage Sites like the Taj Mahal and the Roman Forum with unprecedented precision and detail. The digital assessments will be translated into 3-D models which will provide essential information to best preserve and restore these sites in the future. Professor Krusche’s comprehensive mapping technology and expertise have led her to be recognized as a leading expert on the construction of the Taj Mahal. After earthquakes devastated much of nearby Nepal last spring, authorities called on Professor Krusche to assess the condition of the Taj Mahal and identify any deterioration to ensure the future of the Indian landmark.
