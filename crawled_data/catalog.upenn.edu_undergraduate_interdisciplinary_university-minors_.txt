Nursing and Health Services Management School of Nursing/The Wharton School Increasingly, the delivery of health care involves decisions that entail considerations beyond clinical or medical issues. With the rise of managed care in the United States, it is critical for health professionals to understand not only the clinical factors that affect patients but also the business environment in which healthcare institutions function. This program, a partnership between the School of Nursing and The Wharton School, helps students understand both the nature of the economic and managerial constraints that healthcare organizations face, as well as how these constraints can be effectively managed to provide the best possible health care for patients.
