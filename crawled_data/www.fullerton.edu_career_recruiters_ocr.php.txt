If you have any questions regarding these policies please contact Stephanie Reyes sreyes@fullerton.edu Overview On-Campus Interviewing (OCI) at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) is a convenient and cost-effective way for employers to select and interview candidates for full-time career employment or career-related paid internship opportunities. Company information, job descriptions, resume submissions and interview schedules are all managed through our Online Employer Services program (Titan Connection). OCI services are available upon a consultation with a team member from the Employer Relations unit. Update**Our On-Campus Interview (OCI) Program has transitioned to a virtual format for our fall 2020 semester. Our Virtual Campus Interview Program will allow you to recruit CSUF students for your paid internship and full-time career opportunities all through our Titan Connection (Symplicity) platform. The types of interview options listed below will still be available with exception to "room reservation" only during our virtual semester. The process of recruiting students for your interview opportunities will take place via the Titan Connection platform, while the actual virtual interview(s) will take place on a virtual platform of your preference. For additional questions please email Stephanie Reyes at sreyes@fullerton.edu.

How to Request an OCI Schedule Video Tutorial <p>Your browser does not support frames.</p> Schedule Logistics OCI Model Choose the schedule that best meets your recruitment needs. Pre-Select: Allows the employer to view resumes prior to the campus visit and invite selected students to participate in the on-campus interview. Pre-select to Alternate: Allows the employer to view resumes prior to the campus visit and make primary (preselect) and secondary selections (alternate). Preselected students will sign up for an interview time slot first. After preselect sign up has closed alternate candidates will then have the opportunity to select a time slot. This type of selection process will almost ensure a full schedule. Open: The open schedule allows qualified candidates to sign up for the interview on a first-come, first-serve basis and does not allow the employer to pre-screen. Room Reservation Only (not applicable during Virtual OCI): Can only be used in conjunction with one of the schedule types above. Interview Time Schedule Choose the appropriate schedule based on the number of students you want to interview and your desired interview length. 30-Minute Interviews 12 interview slots per schedule 45-Minute Interviews 8 interview slots per schedule 60-Minute Interviews 6 interview slots per schedule Changes in Interview Schedules Once you have invited students to interview, they will sign up for one of the open time slots that you have made available. Occasionally, there will be gaps in your interview schedule. Please understand that students have selected their time slot around their other academic and work commitments and often find it difficult to reschedule at the last minute. If you must alter your schedule after student sign up is open, it is your responsibility to inform our office and to personally contact each student on your interview schedule. Schedules will freeze at 12:00 am the day before the interview date. You will receive the most up-to-date version of your schedule at the Career Center on the day of your visit. Policies Positions On-Campus Interviewing is open to employers with entry-level, full-time positions and career-related paid internships. Campus interviewing is not available to employers with commission only or draw against salary positions. Career Center facilities are to be used solely to speak with students and alumni from CSUF or individuals eligible for CSUF Career Center services. No Lobby Representatives/"Greeters" (not applicable during Virtual OCI) Due to limited space in our Career Center we do not have offices or lobby space available for greeters. You are welcome to reach out to students prior to their interview time to set up a greeter meeting outside of our office. Cancellations/No Shows Should you need to cancel your OCR date/schedule we request that you contact Stephanie Reyes at sreyes@fullerton.edu no less than two business days prior to your actual visit. We will notify students of your cancellation. Fees may be assessed in the event of a no show. This site is maintained by Career Center.
