We are firmly committed to providing high quality, reliable and timely service to you. At OADDL, we make every effort to charge reasonable fees for our diagnostic services and to avoid hidden fees.

We also publish a quarterly electronic Newsletter that contains information on current diseases in Oklahoma, updates from OADDL and educational articles.
