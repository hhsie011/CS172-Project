Close Search / Sustainability / Recycling Recycling SUSTAINABILITY Sustainability Projects Recycling Initiatives Ways To Conserve Transportation & Parking Classes, Programs & Opportunities Investment Priorities Single stream recycling, also known as “fully commingled,” is practiced on TU’s campus. The single stream system mixes all paper fibers and every type of container (glass, metal, etc.) together in a collection truck, eliminating the need to sort recyclables into separate containers for newspaper, cardboard, plastic, glass, etc. The single stream process makes recycling easy since there are only two containers needed —trash and recyclables. Current Efforts Major efforts have been made campus wide to make recycling options available. Below are details about where specific items can be recycled. In addition to the locations listed below in the On-Campus Recycling Center section, TU has the following initiatives: Yard waste collected in the West Yard is taken to the City of Tulsa’s collection site where it is turned into mulch. Dell Computer Recycling Program – TU electronics recycling averages 43,025 lbs. annually through Dell’s Asset Recovery Services. Approximately 25-32% waste diverted from traditional waste including cardboard, batteries, glass, plastic, aluminum, steel, antifreeze, waste oil and fluorescent lights (including 5% for grease) One part-time sustainability officer – 5 part-time staff and 2 students to sort recycling- recycling pick up done by janitorial staff West Yard of Facilities Management (2006) and bike shop (2006) dedicated to sustainability 100% of buildings have designated recycling areas Recyclemania participation On-Campus Recycling Center Recycling receptacles are located in all buildings and events centers on campus. Single stream collection of plastics (1-7), aluminum cans, paper and glass bottles in targeted areas. Paperboard/cardboard, motor oil/antifreeze, fluorescent bulbs and batteries in the Facilities Management. The University Recycling Center collects approximately 200,000 lbs./year.

It’s a friendly competition and benchmarking tool for college and university recycling programs to promote waste reduction activities to their campus communities. Over an 8-week period each spring, colleges report the amount of recycling and trash collected each week and are ranked based on who recycles the most on a per capita. National recognition is provided to the winning school in each category. Terracycling What is Terracycling? TerraCycle is a highly awarded, international up-cycling and recycling company that collects difficult-to-recycle packaging and products that it repurposes into affordable, innovative products. TerraCycle is considered the world’s leader in the collection and reuse of non-recyclable, post-consumer waste. A user joins a “brigade” that is a specific set of recyclables, and they begin collecting. Once the collection has reached the specific brigade requirements, the recyclables can be mailed back.
