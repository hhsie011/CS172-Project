In addition, we offer three other admission routes for qualified applicants, which results in a remarkably talented and diverse medical student body. Each route has special characteristics, application requirements, and deadlines that are program specific. PLME Route The second-largest cohort begins at Brown as undergraduates in the Program in Liberal Medical Education (PLME), a combined 8-year baccalaureate/MD program in which students obtain a liberal arts education while completing their premed requirements. Exceptionally strong candidates currently in high school can apply through the PLME route. Program in Liberal Medical Education (PLME) Brown’s Program in Liberal Medical Education (PLME) combines undergraduate education and professional studies in medicine in a single 8-year program. Program in Liberal Medical Education Postbac Linkage Route Another group of students consists of our career changers who completed an undergraduate degree and then eventually enrolled in a postbaccalaureate program at one the following four institutions with whom we maintain a consortial agreement: Bryn Mawr College, Columbia University, Goucher College, and Johns Hopkins University. Advisers at these four linkage schools nominate students from within their program to apply to The Warren Alpert Medical School. EIP Route The Early Identification Program (EIP) offers provisional admittance to promising Rhode Island residents who are enrolled at Providence College, Rhode Island College, or the University of Rhode Island.
