Our mission is to provide innovative research, education, training, and technological solutions to address the challenges of substance abuse prevention and other social issues among Florida's population. FCPR history On August 25, 1997, the State of Florida won a landmark lawsuit against the tobacco industry and was awarded an $11.3 billion settlement. The first $200 million received by the State was earmarked to fund a pilot program to reduce youth tobacco use. The Florida Center for Prevention Research (FCPR) was created at Florida State University to support the Florida Tobacco Pilot Program from its inception in February 1998 until its termination on June 30, 2003. Since 2003, the 20 person FCPR team expanded its depth and breadth in substance abuse prevention capabilities under contracts and grants from the Office of the Governor, Department of Children and Families, Department of Education, the U.S. Department of education and others. Located at 2200 Old St Augustine Road in Tallahassee (Off-Campus), FCPR has managed projects in excess of $21 million, ranging from health care to youth programs. Project Managers come with a variety of experience and skills to partner with agencies, through their unique talents they provide sound services and products. Agencies find that while working with FCPR, they work with a team - a successful team that is mission focused! Contact Cynthia B.
