To investigate these processes, she primarily uses marine active-source seismology. Her research at Lamont has mainly focused on the study of the Alaska Peninsula and Hellenic subduction zones with an emphasis on assessing specific risks such as large earthquakes and associated tsunamis and the development of the Eastern North American continental rifted margin. Education B.S. in Physics-Geophysics from the University of Rennes I (France) M.S. and PhD in Geophysics from the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP; France, 2006).
