If you are interested in developing a Lactation Room in your department or school, the following guidelines will help you arrange a space that will fit the needs of lactating mothers. The set-up for an adequate Lactation Room can be accomplished with minimal investment in space and cost. Lactation Room Features An adequate lactation room should be a private room (not a bathroom) and should have the following features: ✓ A door that locks from the outside, for which access can be arranged by ID card reader, key pad, or other mechanism. ✓ A door that locks from the inside, if it is a single occupancy room ✓ A comfortable chair, made of a material that is easy to clean (not cloth covered), that provides sufficient back support and sized so that an average person's feet can touch the floor ✓ An electrical outlet for plugging in a breast pump ✓ Multi-user, hospital-grade breast pump (can be provided by the Office of Work/Life) ✓ A table, on which to rest a breast pump and other supplies, in front of the chair ✓ A sink located in the room or in proximity to the room, along with soap and paper towels ✓ Small refrigerator for storing breast milk ✓ Cleaning wipes and hand sanitizer ✓ Soft light, pictures, and decorations that encourage relaxation Office of Work/Life staff will be responsible for managing access to the room and will work with a designated building representative to ensure that the room is properly maintained and on a regular cleaning schedule. Please contact the Office of Work/Life if you would like to discuss setting up a room in your building or department.
