One of the more common is telephone harassment. Repetitive hang-ups, anonymous obscene phone calls are all examples of telephone harassment. Telephone harassment is defined as an offense with the intent to harass, annoy, alarm, abuse, torment or embarrass by telephone or writing. Telephone harassment may also be communication which is obscene or threatening. Individuals who receive harassing, annoying or threatening telephone calls are encouraged to contact UHPD for assistance at 713-743-3333. If at all possible maintain a telephone log that documents the dates and times of the calls. This will be helpful in determining what measures the Police may pursue. A more insidious form of harassment is sexual harassment. Sexual harassment of students is a real and serious problem in education at all levels, including colleges and universities. It can affect any student, regardless of sex, race, or age. Sexual harassment can threaten a student's physical or emotional well-being, influence how well a student does in school, and make it difficult for a student to achieve his or her career goals. Moreover, sexual harassment is illegal--Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) prohibits sex discrimination, including sexual harassment. Preventing and remedying sexual harassment in schools is essential to ensure nondiscriminatory, safe environments in which students can learn. If you would like more information, or feel you may have been the victim of sexual harassment, contact the UH Office of Equal Opportunity Services.
