Our curriculum builds the practice of medicine on a foundation of basic science. We develop outstanding clinical skills through experiential learning that spans all four years of training. Geisel students are trained in compassionate, patient- and family-centered care that addresses the “whole” patient. Community service is an integral part of the medical student experience and our students participate in a remarkable array of opportunities to serve our communities. Health care delivery science is integral to our curriculum and is taught throughout the first two years of the curriculum. Our students learn in and are part of a strong, supportive community. Message from the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education Our medical education program is administered and delivered by a close-knit community of dedicated faculty and staff who aspire to help our students reach their fullest potential in their professional development. We highly value the one on one relationships we build with our diverse student body and embrace the opportunity to continuously adapt to address their expectations and needs, implement the latest in learning theory, and assure our graduates will be prepared to address the evolving health needs of the patients and populations they will serve.
