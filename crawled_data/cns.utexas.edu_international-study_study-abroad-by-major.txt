International Study Research & Internships Study Abroad by Major Premier Partners Faculty Led Programs Contact PAI 3.04 (512) 232-9358 Texas Institute for Discovery Education in Science College of Natural Sciences The University of Texas at Austin 103 W. 24th St., G2550 Austin, TX 78712 Home International Study Study Abroad by Major Santiago Benavides in ParisStudying abroad for a semester or full academic year is an excellent way to immerse yourself in another culture, learn different perspectives on science and gain the cross-cultural skills that will prepare you for your career. Exchange Programs Through exchange programs, CNS students are able to attend foreign partner institutions and take regular university courses alongside students from the host university. This is an ideal option for students looking to live abroad for an extended period while taking a full load of courses that will help them stay on track for graduation at UT. (Students seeking shorter-term experiences should explore UT faculty-led programs.) Programs for Science Majors UT Austin has exchange programs with over 150 of the world’s most respected universities, giving students access to some of the best institutions around the world. Carol ReyesTo take the guesswork out of selecting the right exchange program, we have created study abroad guides specifically for science majors. Each guide provides a list of 12-15 CNS Premier Partner Universities, highly-ranked exchange programs that have been carefully pre-screened and selected by our faculty. Pre-Approved Coursework CNS Premier Partners offer a wide selection of pre-approved courses that you need to complete your UT science degree.
