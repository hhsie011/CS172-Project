As you get started, it may be helpful to look at examples of finished posters. Below are a number of sample posters created by UT undergraduates. There is a brief discussion of each poster highlighting its greatest strengths and areas where there is room for improvement. Strengths More than one type of visual aid Logical order for sections Acknowledgments Room for improvement Background may be distracting, or detract from content Sections and images are not aligned Too many visual components clutter poster Strengths White space Legible text and graphics Reports preliminary results All participants listed as authors, with affiliations provided Room for improvement Lacks Citations and Acknowledgements Labeling of images/graphics Inconsistent text alignment Color-saturated background Strengths Clearly defined research questions Effective use of visual aids Clear organizational structure Bullets break up text Room for improvement Technical language/undefined acronyms (accessible to limited audience) Narrow margins within text boxes Too many thick borders around boxes Uses UT seal instead of college or university wordmark Strengths Clear introductory material Use of bullet points Logical flow Color-coding in graphics Room for improvement Lacks references section May not be accessible to all audiences (some technical language) No need for borders around sections (the blue headers are sufficient) Strengths Compelling visual aids Strategic use of color Clear sections Font sizes Room for improvement Inconsistent fonts in body text Editing Abstract section mislabeled Bullet points are great, but only if they’re used judiciously Strengths Parameters of study well defined Clearly defined research question Simple color scheme Clear sections Use of white space Room for improvement Discussion of Results Minor formatting misalignments Long title Unauthorized use of UT seal (use wordmark instead) Strengths Venn diagram in discussion Consistent graphics Multiple types of visual aids Room for improvement Light text on dark background Color backgrounds should be avoided, especially dark ones Unlabeled, non-credited photos Strengths Easy to read Clearly defined research question Use of white space Simple color scheme Use of shapes, figures, and bullets to break up text Compelling title (and title font size) Clean overall visual impression Room for improvement Many sections without a clear flow between them Lacks acknowledgements Strengths Logical flow Simple color scheme Use of images/graphics Clear title Accessible but professional tone Room for improvement Length/density of text blocks Tiny photo citations Connections between images and descriptive text Vertical boxes unnecessary Strengths Easy to read Strategic use of color Use of white space Compelling title Font sizes throughout (hierarchy of text) Simple graphics Room for improvement Lacks clear Background section Relationship of Findings and Conclusion to Research questions Bullet points are great, but only if they’re used judiciously Strengths Font sizes Simple color scheme Use of visual aids Room for improvement Uneven column width Center-justfied body text Lacks “Methods” section Strengths Font sizes Clear sections Logical flow Simple graphics Use of white space Use of bullets Room for improvement Too many different font styles (serif and sans serif, bold and normal) Concise interpretation of graphics Strengths Accessible visual structure Clear, simple graphics Use of white space Fonts and font sizes Room for improvement Analysis of graphic data Discussion of significance Lacks author’s affiliation and contact information Strengths Balance among visuals, text and white space Data presented in visual format (SmartArt) Simple color scheme Font sizes Accesible to many audiences (simple enough for general audience, but enough methodological detail for experts) Room for improvement Some more editing needed When targeting an expert audience (as in the methodology section), should also report statistics (r, p, t, F, etc.) References Strengths Large, clear title Creative adaptation of sections Use of lists (rather than paragraphs) Accessible to diverse audience Room for improvement Logical flow Connection between visuals (sheet music) and content Narrow margins within text boxes Strengths Clear sections Strategic use of color for section headers Labeling and citation of images Accessible to a broad audience Clearly defined research question Wide margins around poster edges Room for improvement Slightly text-heavy Data referenced (“Methodology”) but not discussed What is my next step?
