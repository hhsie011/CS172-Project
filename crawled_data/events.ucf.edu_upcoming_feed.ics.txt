The question is usually not "Does the government buy what you are selling?"...it is more "Can you be competitive enough and relentless enough to position your business to win government contracts?" If you think you can be competitive, then government contracting may be a good growth opportunity for your business.\n\nThe "Government Contracting Overview" seminar, presented by the Florida PTAC at UCF in partnership with the Florida SBDC at UCF, is designed for established small business owners with some commercial momentum that are curious about government contracting, as well as business owners that may already be involved in government contracting.\n\nThis workshop will present government contracting in three components:\n\n 1. Positioning for Government Contracting\n 2. Developing Reactive Business Development Strategies\n 3. Developing Proactive Business Development Strategies\n\n\n\nSpecifically, we will discuss registration requirements, social-economic certification opportunities, market research tools, Florida PTAC's "Bid-Match" system, and what we refer to as the initial "Marketing Tool Kit" for government contractors.\n\nJoin us for this great learning opportunity!\n\nVirtual Location URL: https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/rt/8168161251519057931?source=ucfcal\nRegistration Link: https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/rt/8168161251519057931?source=ucfcal END:VEVENT BEGIN:VEVENT UID:https://events.ucf.edu/event/2437104/interviewing-strategies-presented-by-ocps-crmsummer22/ DTSTAMP:20220601T100000 DTSTART:20220601T100000 DTEND:20220601T110000 LOCATION:Virtual SUMMARY:Interviewing Strategies, presented by OCPS #CRMSummer22 URL:https://events.ucf.edu/event/2437104/interviewing-strategies-presented-by-ocps-crmsummer22/ DESCRIPTION:Orange County Public Schools will share helpful tips for virtual and in-person interviews!\n\n * Participate in Career Readiness, May 31 - June 7.
