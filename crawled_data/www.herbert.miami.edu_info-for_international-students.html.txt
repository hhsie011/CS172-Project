Most private programs require a credit-worthy U.S. citizen or permanent resident as a co-signer and other restrictions apply. International Education Financial Aid website offers a comprehensive listing of grants, scholarships, loan programs and other information to assist students in their quest to study abroad. STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR FORM I-20 All international students who require a student visa (F-1) must submit a bank verification statement or an official letter of sponsorship in English from their government or agency. The bank verification must include the student’s name and relationship to the sponsor, if other than the student, and verify that there are sufficient funds to cover the estimated expenses of two semesters of graduate studies listed on the enclosed estimated expense sheet. International students should begin this process as soon as possible. If you wish to include your family, we will require the following: 1) in the bank verification or letter of sponsorship, list each family member’s name, date of birth, country of citizenship and relationship to you, and 2) financial support of $13,124 for your spouse or first dependent and $4,973 for each child per year. The Certificate of Eligibility (I-20 Form) will be issued only once the above documentation is on file and the required enrollment fee has been received to reserve your place in the program. The bank verification or sponsorship letter must be dated no more than 6 months prior to enrollment. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us at (305) 284-2510 or email mba@miami.edu.
