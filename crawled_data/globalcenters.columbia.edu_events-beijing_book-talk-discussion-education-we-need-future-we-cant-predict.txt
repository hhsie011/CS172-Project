10:00 PM Online Time: 8:30 - 10:00 PM (Beijing) | 8:30 - 10:00 AM (New York) This event will feature a conversation between Professor Thomas Hatch and leading education experts in China on why efforts to change and reform conventional schools fail so often and what concrete steps we can take to transform the education system over the long term. Points to be covered: Why do schools need to change? Why is it so hard to change conventional schooling on a large scale? What does it take to create new schools and more powerful learning experiences? How can we transform education altogether? About the Book In order for educational systems to change, we must reevaluate deep-seated beliefs about learning, teaching, schooling, and race that perpetuate inequitable opportunities and outcomes. In his new book, drawing on his experiences as an observer, researcher, educator, and an involved parent in the past 30 years in the U.S. as well as in other countries like Norway, Professor Hatch shows how to challenge the conventional structures, practices, and beliefs that define educational experiences for so many children and casts a new vision of what school could be. This provocative book addresses current systemic problems and solutions as it: Highlights global examples of successful school change Describes strategies that improve educational opportunities and performance Explores promising approaches to developing new learning opportunities Outlines conditions for supporting wide-scale educational improvement Author Thomas Hatch is a Professor at Teachers College, Columbia University and Director of the National Center for Restructuring Education, Schools, and Teaching (NCREST). His research includes studies of school improvement efforts at the school, district, and national levels.
