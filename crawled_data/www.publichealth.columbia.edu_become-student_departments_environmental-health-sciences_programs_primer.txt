PrIMER is funded by the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences and provides research trainees the opportunity to gain valuable research experience in environmental health sciences. Students from Colleges and Universities in the New York City area are eligible to participate.

Trainees are paired with a Columbia University faculty member who serves as a research and academic mentor throughout the program. Trainees conduct research in environmental health sciences, attend weekly professional development workshops, and interact closely with Columbia University faculty. Each fall, trainees present their summer research experience at the PrIMER Research Symposium that takes place during our departmental seminar and is attended by faculty, students, and research staff. Trainees work with their mentor to continue research during the academic year.
