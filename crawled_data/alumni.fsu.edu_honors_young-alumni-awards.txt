Before joining The Weather Channel, Lowry worked at the National Hurricane Center, where he led the design and development of a new storm surge forecast graphic that will become public in 2015. Joe O'Shea (B.S. '08) As an FSU undergraduate, O’Shea co-founded the Lower Ninth Ward Health Clinic, which raised funds and constructed free health clinics after Hurricane Katrina. He helped construct a school in Rwanda and championed community healthcare in Leon County. For those efforts and more, O'Shea was recognized with a Rhodes Scholarship and obtained his M.Sc. and Ph.D. from Oxford University. Today he is back at FSU as director of undergraduate research.
