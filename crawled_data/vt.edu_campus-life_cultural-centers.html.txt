As you begin your time at Virginia Tech, there a few terms, groups, and places you’ll come to know by heart. InclusiveVT is the institutional and individual commitment to Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) in the spirit of community, diversity, and excellence. Find out more about what we offer students. Our Cultural and Community Centers represent six important, culture-specific spaces within the Squires Student Center. These six centers aim to create the conditions for underrepresented student success and to develop the cultural competence of every Virginia Tech student. The Women’s Center at Virginia Tech upholds a mission of promoting a community that is safe, equitable, and supportive for women and that celebrates their experiences, achievements, and diversity. The Interfaith Network was created with a purpose of fostering appreciative and meaningful relationships across the dozens of faiths — from Christians to freethinkers to Muslims to atheists — who live together at Virginia Tech. Cranwell International Center exists to articulate, advocate, and act in support of international students. And we also have resources for students with young children and families of their own. The Virginia Tech Graduate School supports three child-care and family-support-focused programs for graduate and undergraduate students, associated with the university’s commitment to a work-life friendly atmosphere.
