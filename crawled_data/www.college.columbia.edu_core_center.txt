This support includes weekly faculty luncheons and pedagogical seminars, as well as annual conferences, course-wide lectures and other events. The Center also oversees--and continuously develops--teaching resources for Core faculty that are available on-line and in its faculty library. The intellectual leadership for each course is the responsibility of its Chair, a faculty member with extensive Core teaching experience, serving a three year term. In close collaboration with the faculty and partners around and off campus, the Center administers Core Programming, a robust schedule of extra-curricular activities that enhance the curriculum with the bustling cultural life of New York City. Under the leadership of the Dean of Alumni Education, the Center also provides opportunities for continued engagement for loyal Core alumni all over the U.S. and the world. Center for the Core staff work closely with the offices of Academic Affairs and Student Affairs to resolve student issues that are particular to the Core experience.
