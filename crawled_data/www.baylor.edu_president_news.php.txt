May 19 2022 Presidential Perspective - May 19, 2022 This is my first official Presidential Perspective of the summer. While the foot traffic on campus is a little lighter this week, the University is still quite active with the minimester underway and students in the Law School and graduate and professional programs continuing their academic work. May 12 2022 Presidential Perspective - May 12, 2022 Commencement is always a special time on the Baylor campus, and this year has added significance for the First Gent and me.

May 5 2022 Presidential Perspective - May 5, 2022 It's hard to believe that today is the last class day of the spring semester!

I would love to see you and wish you well as we conclude the spring semester and enter the summer season. Apr 28 2022 Presidential Perspective - April 28, 2022 We enjoyed a wonderful night with Baylor faculty and staff Monday to say “thank you” to everyone who helped Baylor achieve R1 recognition as a research university.

Apr 14 2022 Happy Easter from Baylor University We rejoice this Easter in the resurrection of Jesus Christ and give thanks for His overwhelming love for us. Apr 7 2022 Presidential Perspective - April 7, 2022 I don’t think we could have asked for a better combination of warm sunshine and a full slate of activities for this week’s return of Diadeloso, or “Day of the Bear,” as we celebrated this great tradition’s 90th anniversary. Mar 31 2022 Presidential Perspective - March 31, 2022 Dia is back! After two years without this annual spring celebration, I can't wait to enjoy a day of fun on campus with you this Tuesday, April 5. Mar 24 2022 Presidential Perspective - March 24, 2022 The Baylor campus is a busy place during the spring semester, buzzing with students and visitors who come together for a variety of reasons. Sometimes the occasion is a lecture, a social gathering or a musical or theatrical performance. Sometimes the reason people gather here is an athletics event. Mar 17 2022 Presidential Perspective - March 17, 2022 Welcome back from Spring Break – March Madness is finally here! I am sending this week’s email a little early, as I am en route to Dickies Arena in Fort Worth to watch Coach Scott Drew and our defending national champion men’s basketball team take on Norfolk State at 1 p.m. in the opening round of the NCAA Tournament. Then I will be back in Waco tomorrow for Coach Nicki Collen’s NCAA Tournament debut as our Bears face Hawaii at 3 p.m. in the Ferrell Center. Best wishes to our student-athletes, coaches and staffs as they shine in the spotlight, and let’s Sic ’em, Bears! Mar 3 2022 Presidential Perspective - March 3, 2022 It was such a joy last week to experience the musical and dance talents of the more than 1,500 students who participated in Sing this spring. Feb 24 2022 Presidential Perspective - February 24, 2022 One outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic is that we have the ability to temporarily pivot to remote instruction and operations when winter weather conditions threaten. Gone are the days of waking up at 5 a.m. to see if it will be an ice or snow day. Of course, I fondly remember those snow days from when I was in college! Feb 17 2022 Presidential Perspective - February 17, 2022 Today we are announcing the rescission of the University's facemask policy for classrooms and labs when used in academic settings. In other words, facemasks will be optional at Baylor – other than when requested in private offices – effective this Monday, Feb. 21. Feb 10 2022 Presidential Perspective - February 10, 2022 What an exciting time for Baylor as we’ve surpassed the $1.1 billion fundraising goal of the Give Light campaign! Feb 8 2022 Ad Unitatem: Toward Unity When Black historian Carter Woodson initiated the first Negro History Week in 1926, he did so with the hope that it would eventually no longer be necessary. He hoped that education about Black history would become so mainstream that a week would become redundant.
