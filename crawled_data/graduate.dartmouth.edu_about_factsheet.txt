The Guarini School supports more than 1,000 graduate students, doctoral candidates, and postdoctoral scholars in 35 programs—all graduate students at Dartmouth except Tuck's MBA students and Geisel's MD students. "Education is the most important word in our language, in any language," said Congressman Guarini. "It's how we create leaders, grow our economy, and learn about other people, which nurtures peace. Education is the key to a better world."
