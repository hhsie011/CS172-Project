Jyotika Ramaprasad, Department of Journalism and Media Management Indian Journalists’ Views in a Time of Uncertainty: Risks, Threats, and Consequences. This study of Indian journalists is part of a 110+ country, open source project, the Worlds of Journalism Study (WJS), with scheduled data collection between March 1, 2020 and December 31, 2022. Within WJS, India occupies a major position as the largest world democracy with a free expression constitutional clause. Despite this promise, today Indian journalists face several threats including attacks on journalistic epistemologies and physical/emotional harm, the latter growing under a conservative government implementing a fundamentalist ideology. The India project will collect and analyze data on threats and develop a localized theoretical understanding of how Indian journalists negotiate them. William Rothman, Department of Cinema and Interactive Media The Holiday in His Eye. The Holiday in His Eye is a book about Stanley Cavell, the only major American philosopher who made the subject of film a central part of his work. Although appreciation of the singular value of his work is far more widespread than it was through most of his career, within the field of film studies the usefulness of philosophy as he practiced it remains widely unrecognized. The goal of this book is to make Cavell’s thought accessible to readers unfamiliar with his writings and, for readers to whom his work is already important, offer a deeper understanding of Cavell’s vision of film and philosophy.
