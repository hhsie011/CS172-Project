Dedicated to inventing the future of the humanities, Texts and Technology is an interdisciplinary doctoral program that integrates fields such as writing, rhetoric, philosophy, technical communication, and public history with digital methods and practices in coding, game design, and archiving. The program supports engagement with digital practices in dialectical, rhetorical, procedural, and critical-cultural fields. The T&T program considers literacy in a broad sense, from traditional notions of writing and communication to more contemporary notions of computational and procedural literacy (e.g., using programming and new media installations as inventive methods for production, critique, and analysis). Since 2001, UCF's Texts and Technology doctoral program has excelled in supporting its students with an internationally recognized faculty and by offering a rigorous curriculum in a friendly environment. Students bring knowledge of a specific discipline and deepen their understanding of the subject through a digital lens.

Admission to Candidacy 3 Total Credits Candidacy Examination Earn at least 3 credits from the following types of courses: ENC 7919 Doctoral Research 3 credit hours Students are admitted to doctoral candidacy status upon completion of a written examination with three parts—one part based on a reading list reviewed biennially by the Texts and Technology faculty and the other two parts based on reading lists prepared by each student and approved by the examination committee. The candidacy examination for each student is written and evaluated by a committee of three UCF Texts and Technology graduate faculty members chosen by the student. Students must be registered for ENC 7919 during the semester in which they take their candidacy examination and they must find a Texts and Technology core faculty member to serve as the chair of their examination during the semester before enrolling in ENC 7919. Students cannot register for dissertation credit (ENC 7980) until the semester after they have successfully passed the candidacy examination. Students who fail the candidacy examination a second time cannot continue in the program. The following are required in order to be admitted to candidacy and enroll in dissertation hours: Successful completion of all coursework, except for dissertation hours. Successful completion of the candidacy examination. Completion of College of Graduate Studies CITI and Academic Integrity Training. An approved dissertation advisory committee is on file, consisting of approved graduate faculty and graduate faculty scholars. A current, approved program of study is on file. Dissertation and Oral Defense 15 Total Credits Earn at least 15 credits from the following types of courses: ENC 7980 Students choose their dissertation adviser and committee from among the faculty in the Texts and Technology PhD program and must have one member from outside the College of Arts and Humanities. Students choose the adviser after they have completed approximately 27 credit hours toward the degree or after the first year-and-a-half of coursework. All dissertation committee members, including outside readers, must hold a PhD or another relevant degree or, if serving as a UCF Graduate Scholar, the external member must have documented evidence of exceptional relevant experience and/or scholarly or creative productivity. Students must write a dissertation on their research that will explain and defend a significant original contribution to the field of Texts and Technology. It may be of a theoretical, historical or pragmatic nature, but must meet conventional academic standards. Students are required to submit and defend a written dissertation proposal (the prospectus) during the first year in dissertation. The dissertation committee administers the candidate's oral defense of the dissertation, with passing determined by acceptance by a majority of the committee. The dissertation adviser, the dissertation committee and the dean of the college or designee must approve the final dissertation. Format approval is required from the Thesis and Dissertation Office and final approval of degree requirement completion by the College of Graduate Studies (Millican Hall 230). Students will submit at least one substantial scholarly article to a national and/or international peer-reviewed journal or proceedings conference with the approval and assistance of the dissertation chair and the director of the doctoral program.

Applicants must hold an earned master's degree from an accredited institution recognized by UCF or recognized foreign institution prior to entering the Texts and Technology program. Fields with a technological and/or textual theory component, such as digital humanities, public history, technical communication, digital media, cultural studies, philosophy, rhetoric, or linguistics, are especially applicable. The total Texts and Technology doctoral program is a combination of an earned master's degree and the Ph.D. core, Area of Specialization, and interdisciplinary elective coursework, and dissertation hours. The Texts and Technology (T&T) PhD requires a minimum of 42 credit hours of coursework beyond the master's degree, including a minimum of 3 hours of doctoral research and 15 hours of dissertation. Eighteen credit hours are required in seven core courses. These core courses provide an interdisciplinary framework for all students. The remaining credit hours consist of additional courses in an Area of Specialization, interdisciplinary electives, and research hours. Earned Master's Degree (minimum 30 credit hours) + 42 UCF Graduate Credit hours = 72 graduate credit hours. The GRE is not required for admission to this program. Three letters of recommendation. These should be from faculty members, university administrators, or employers. The letters should be current to the application and should address the relevant skills of the applicant, the aspirations of the candidate, and an assessment of the applicant's ability to perform graduate-level research. Letters that provide specific examples are more helpful than those that speak about the applicant's abilities in vague generalities. Confidential letters are preferred. Statement of Purpose: The statement should explain the motivation behind the pursuit of an interdisciplinary doctoral degree in Texts and Technology and discuss future career goals. The statement should discuss all relevant professional background and any previous research experience. The statement should address why the interdisciplinary composition of Texts and Technology is appropriately aligned with the applicant's future research goals. The applicant must clearly describe the particular area(s) of research interest and identify any UCF faculty members who share a similar research focus and with whom the applicant would like to work.

The statement should be between 500 and 1,200 words. A substantial academic writing sample (between 10 and 25 double-spaced pages) and an optional digital portfolio illustrating the applicant's ability to engage in advanced academic work should be submitted as part of the application materials. Acceptable writing samples may include a chapter from a master's thesis, a conference paper, a term paper for a seminar, or other research projects that demonstrate the applicant's ability to pursue the type of research that could possibly lead to a completed dissertation. The optional digital portfolio may include examples of digital humanities or interactive media projects that are annotated appropriately to explain the applicant's contribution to the design and development process. Résumé or CV. Applicants to this program, except those that have earned or will earn a Masters or Doctoral degree from an accredited U.S. institution recognized by UCF, who have attended a college/university outside the United States must provide a course-by-course credential evaluation with GPA calculation. Credential evaluations are accepted from World Education Services (WES) or Josef Silny and Associates, Inc. only. Meeting minimum UCF admission criteria does not guarantee program admission. Final admission is competitive and is based on a comparative evaluation of each applicant's proficiencies, past performance, recommendations, as well as the match of this program and faculty expertise to the applicant's career/academic goals, and the applicant's potential for completing the degree.
