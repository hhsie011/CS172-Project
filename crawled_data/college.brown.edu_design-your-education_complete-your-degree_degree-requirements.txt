Breadcrumb Home Design Your Education Complete Your Degree Sub Navigation In This Section Degree Requirements Writing Requirement Degree Options Culminating Experiences Commencement Degree Requirements Four basic obligations must be fulfilled to graduate from Brown. Requirements to Graduate from Brown Earn at least 30 course credits You are required to earn a minimum of 30 Brown course credits, or the equivalent in approved transfer courses. A combined maximum of 15 transfer course credits and no more than four summer course credits (at Brown or elsewhere) or winter course credits (taken at Brown) may count toward this requirement. Complete a concentration Brown offers nearly 80 standard concentrations that lead to either the Bachelor of Arts or the Bachelor of Science degree. You also have the option of creating an independent concentration, with the approval of the College Curriculum Council. Comprehensive information on all concentration programs is available on brown.edu. Learn about the resources for exploring your concentration options at Brown and the process of declaring a concentration. Demonstrate competence in writing Learning to write well is a developmental process that occurs over time. You are therefore required to work on your writing at least twice: once in your first two years of study, and a second time as a junior or senior. You must complete an approved writing course at Brown in your first two years of study. Exceptions are made at the time of credit articulation if you are a transfer student; you may meet this part of the requirement with an appropriate course (transferred in the subjects of English, comparative literature, or literary arts) from your prior institution. As a junior and senior, you must demonstrate that you have worked on your writing a second time in a course you have taken at Brown. You may take another approved writing course to meet this part of the requirement, or if approved by the concentration, you may upload a substantial piece of writing developed within the concentration. Writing completed in courses taken away from Brown will not meet Part 2 of the writing requirement. If you have an uncleared writing check, you will not be able to graduate, even if you have completed at least two writing-designated or approved (English, comparative literature, literary arts) courses. Learn more about the University Writing Requirement. Fulfill eight-semester enrollment requirement You must be enrolled for the equivalent of eight full-time semesters of instruction, four of which must be in residence at Brown during fall and/or spring semesters. Tuition payments are based on the norm of 32 courses, four courses in each of eight semesters, whereby standard tuition charges result in the accrual of 32 enrollment units. Students who have questions about meeting this requirement without eight semesters of full-time enrollment at Brown should meet with a Degree Completion Dean (degreecompletiondeans@brown.edu).
