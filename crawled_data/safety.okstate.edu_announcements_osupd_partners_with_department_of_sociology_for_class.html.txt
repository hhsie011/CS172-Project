The Oklahoma State University Police Department first joined with the Department of Sociology to offer the course in the fall, introducing students to the realities faced by modern law enforcement. The course explores the fundamentals of policing in a college setting, applying both theoretical knowledge and practical experience. The class covers the organizational structure, function and goals of the OSUPD, a sociological perspective based on case law and modern policing principles and topics, and issues and terminology used in law enforcement. A portion of the class includes hands-on learning including crime-scene preservation, traffic stops and time on a training simulator that provides real-life scenarios in a safely controlled environment. “For several years we have hosted a Citizens Police Academy that provides OSU employees with a glimpse into the efforts taken to protect the campus community,” OSU Police Chief Leon Jones said. “We have taken it one step further and provided this opportunity for our students as well. It’s another opportunity to provide insight and introduce transparency into what we do.” Back To Top Back To Top Oklahoma State University Stillwater, OK 74078 Campus & Parking Maps (405) 744-5000 Careers at OSU Hire OSU Grads OSU Institutions Stillwater (Main) Oklahoma City Tulsa Center for Health Sciences (Tulsa) Institute of Technology (Okmulgee) Veterinary Medicine (Stillwater) Follow OSU NewsEventsInside OSU Social Media Directory Facebook Twitter Instagram Linkedin Snapchat OSU Athletics >> © Oklahoma State University.
