Applications completed by this deadline will be given preference; however, applications received after the posted deadline will be reviewed and considered on a rolling basis until February 1. Please contact the Graduate Office with any questions about the deadline. The MLA II is not a LAAB accredited degree. International students interested in pursuing licensure in the United States should apply to the MLA I degree. Pre reqs Prerequisites for admission include a professional 5-year baccalaureate degree in landscape architecture from an LAAB accredited school or its international equivalent. Application information [ ] Follow the application instructions for all SOA graduate programs. [ ] See below for MLA II application requirements. Graduate School requirements [ ] Follow the Graduate School instructions to submit the application, application fee, transcripts and test scores. Applicants should submit a GRE score. The GRE is **WAIVED** for Fall 2022 MLA applications. It may take 72 hours to be removed from your MyStatus after you submit your application. There is no reason to reach out in the interim. Statement of purpose [ ] Upload your statement through MyStatus. + A 1,000-1,500 word essay that addresses your interest in the MLA II program with respect to your academic and professional objectives, the factors that led you to apply to the SOA, a situation or job that helped you define your interest, your most substantial professional contribution and why you view it as such, and/or any other factors related to your academic or professional experience that you wish to convey to the admissions committee. + You may submit your ApplyTexas online application before finishing your statement of purpose. You can later upload your statement through MyStatus. Three letters of recommendation [ ] Manage and track your letters through MyStatus. [ ] Provide recommenders' emails as part of the ApplyTexas online application. + Recommenders may include former instructors and professional employers. + Letters should include comments on the applicant’s intellectual, communicative, and leadership abilities as well as his or her capacity for creativity and relevant personal characteristics. + After you submit your application and pay your application fee, notification emails will be sent to your recommenders. Any delay in submitting your application or application fee will delay the notifications to your recommenders. Résumé or curriculum vitae [ ] Upload through MyStatus. Studio Supplement [ ] Upload the studio supplement as a single pdf through the studio supplement credential on MyStatus. The Studio Supplement consists of a number of creative exercises to be completed by the applicant over a period of 3-4 weeks. These exercises do not presuppose a background in art or design. They are intended to provide all applicants with an equal opportunity to demonstrate skill in critical making, visual thinking, creative experimentation, and material exploration. The Studio Supplement will be distributed to each applicant via email after the application deadline (December 14, 2021) and materials will be due on date to be determined. If you do not receive the Studio Supplement, please contact the Graduate Office. Portfolio [ ] Upload portfolio as a single pdf through the portfolio credential on MyStatus. The portfolio helps the reviewers determine your potential to perform successfully in a studio-based design curriculum. In order to review each application fairly and accurately, the reviewing committee requires evidence in one or more categories: The level of creative skill you possess in any medium. The extent of your interest in the proposed degree program, made evident through your abilities in composition, physical form-making, or perception of the environment. Your ability to translate ideas into physical form, even if in simple terms such as drawing. FORMAT Portfolios should be designed and formatted for on-screen viewing. Maximum file size is 25 MB. ATTRIBUTION For each project, list the applicant’s name, the project’s date, and an indication as to whether the project was academic, office-related, or personal. In the case of collaborative or professional work, the contribution by the applicant must be precisely described. ORGANIZATION The organization of the portfolio is a design exercise. It should be clear, succinct, and thoughtfully composed to best reflect your interests and skills. The quality of the work is of greater importance than quantity. CONTENT The portfolio must show work in the visual arts or design that has been executed by the applicant. The work should include examples of freehand drawings, three-dimensional work, and design process. The committee place emphasis on drawing skills. Those applying for the post-professional or second professional degree are expected to submit examples of work demonstrating their ability to pursue study at an advanced level. Applicants are expected to present a high-quality portfolio showing well-developed graphic skills and a well-developed sense of design, space, form, and volume. Show at least three steps of design development in a specific project and your progression/thought process. Photographs of models help and should be used when possible. A portfolio helps the reviewers associate your desire to enter graduate landscape architecture school with your potential to perform successfully in a studio-based design curriculum. Photographs of landscapes (including travel photographs) as examples of creative work are not acceptable except from studio arts applicants with a major in photography. The committee assumes your portfolio and its format represent your best abilities in design.
