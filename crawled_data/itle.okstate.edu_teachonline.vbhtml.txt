Whether the content is taught synchronously (live) or asynchronously (on your own time), faculty can present information to students, demonstrate processes, facilitate large or small group discussions, assess student learning, and provide feedback on assignments and assessments. Models of Online Course Delivery Overview Video - PDF ITLE supports instructors in their dedication to provide quality learning experiences for all students, whether they occur in physical classroom spaces, online, or through a blend of the two approaches. We encourage instructors to select an approach that best meets their course and program goals, as well as the individual needs of their students. Recognizing the updated definitions of the various models of course delivery provided by the Online Learning Consortium (OLC), we offer the following descriptions as examples of the most commonly occurring learning environments, as well as information related to our support for each approach. The methods fall along a continuum, with approaches that prioritize face-to-face experiences positioned at one end and approaches that take place fully online at the other.
