including summer — for financial aid purposes. Enrollment status for financial aid purposes may differ from enrollment status as defined by other University offices such as the Office of the Registration and Records, the Graduate School, or the Office of International Services. Students who enroll less than full-time may have their aid adjusted after the add/drop period. Enrollment is confirmed on the last day to drop/add a class. Students enrolled less than half-time may be placed on a loan repayment schedule by a lender or guarantor if the student is the recipient of federal financial aid. Full Time 3/4 Time Half Time Less than Half Time Undergraduate credit hours 12+ 9-11 6-8 1-5 Graduate credit hours 9+ 7-8.5 4.5-6.5 1-4 Note: Audit hours are not used in determining enrollment status. Graduate Students Graduate students enrolled in programs requiring completion of a dissertation or thesis may qualify to be classified as enrolled at least half time when they have reached the semester in which a load between 3 and 8 hours will reach an accumulated total equal to the minimum number of hours required by the program, provided they enroll for at least 3 credit hours. The Graduate Plan of Work must be on file to confirm the dissertation or thesis requirement. Courses Required for Degree A student’s enrollment status for financial aid purposes is based on the courses that are applicable to a student’s degree program. If a student is enrolled in courses that do not count toward the degree program, they are not included in the enrollment status for financial aid purposes. Frequently Asked Questions What is a degree-applicable course? A course that is required for a degree program. Why do my classes have to be required for my degree in order to receive financial aid? Federal and state regulations require that funding be applied only to those courses that are applicable to your degree program. How do I ensure that my classes are required for my degree? Review your degree audit in MyPack Portal to ensure that the courses in which you plan to enroll meet one of your degree requirements. Graduate students should review your Graduate Plan of Work or consult with your advisor to ensure classes meet degree requirements. What if I have an intended major or minor? As long as the intended major or minor has been saved as an intention on your degree audit, your enrollment will be mapped against your intention. If you are an undergraduate student and plan to add another major or a minor, it is important to submit a CODA and/or minor declaration as early as possible. Do certificates count? No. Financial aid can only be applied toward completion of a major or a minor. What if I plan to change majors and my Change of Degree Application (CODA) is not yet approved? As long as your CODA request has been submitted, your enrollment will be mapped against both your current major and your intended major. Are pre-requisite courses classified as degree-applicable courses? Yes. If you are required to take a course before you can enroll in a course required for a degree or minor, the course is considered a pre-requisite and counts in your enrollment status for financial aid purposes. If I am a double-major or dual-degree student, what program requirements will be used to verify my enrollment? Both majors/degrees will be used to verify your enrollment in degree-applicable courses. However, once the requirements for one major are complete, you are considered to have graduated, even if you have not formally applied to graduate yet. Students in more than one degree program should ensure that degree requirements for both programs are completed simultaneously; otherwise, financial aid may be adjusted in the term in which one major has been completed. I am an undergraduate student enrolled in 15 credits, 6 of which are not degree applicable. What is my enrollment status for financial aid purposes? Your enrollment status for financial aid purposes is 3/4-time enrollment (9-11 credits). I am an undergraduate student enrolled in 15 credits, 3 of which are not degree applicable. What is my enrollment status for financial aid purposes? Your enrollment status for financial aid purposes is full-time, as long as you remain enrolled in at least 12 degree-applicable credit hours. I have a scholarship. Does this policy apply to me? You should check the requirements for your scholarship with your scholarship provider or contact the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid for clarification. For most scholarship programs, this policy does not apply. I am or will be studying abroad. Does this policy affect me? Your enrollment abroad must also be degree-applicable if you will be receiving financial aid. The Study Abroad Enrollment Agreement form signed by you and your academic advisor serves to ensure that the enrollment plan you make will satisfy this policy. Your foreign transcript will be evaluated upon your return to confirm that all courses completed abroad are degree-applicable. If they are not, your aid may be negatively impacted retroactively. As an advisor, how should I advise my students about this requirement? If an advisee has planned to enroll in a course that does not satisfy a degree requirement, mention this policy for financial aid recipients. If the student is unsure of how the policy applies to them specifically, you may refer them to the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid.
