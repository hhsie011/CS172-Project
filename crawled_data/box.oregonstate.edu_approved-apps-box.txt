For more information about Box apps check out the "What are Box Apps" on our FAQ page. Are there other Apps available? Yes, there are hundreds of apps available through Box's App marketplace. You may use any app you wish with your personal data. Apps listed in the Approved Apps list can be used with institutional data not classified as protected. However, before using any app not listed as approved it is important that you read and understand the following: You are responsible for data sent or stored on computers, devices, and services you use Before using any third party apps be sure you understand and comply with OSU's Information Security Data Classification policies. Third-party applications that work with Box may take the data out of the protected Box environment and onto that company's application servers. OSU's contract with Box does not extend to those companies or applications, so their use for sensitive or protected institutional data is not permitted. Third party applications may also store data unencrypted on their servers. Any app using Web integration is required to use secure (SSL) connections. Some app require licensing and fees. Any fees charged for third party apps are the responsibility of the requesting user or department unless specifically funded by OSU. Apps not in the list of approved apps are not supported by OSU's Service desk. Support requests will need to be sent to the app vendor. Having trouble? If you have an app you would like to use and you find that you cannot grant access to your Box account it is likely an unpublished app. In order to get it to work you will need to do several things before contacting the help desk: Make sure you are authenticating to your Box account from the app using SSO. Contact the vendor and request the ClientID from the Box Developer app's Configuration/OAuth 2.0 Credentials section. Then submit that with your support request, or In some cases you will see a URL when granting access to Box. In that URL is embedded the ClientID. Copy that ID and submit with your support request. clientid.png Box for Research Box for Instruction Box for Students Contact Info Box for OSU Support Students: IS Service Desk Instructors: Box for Instruction Faculty & Staff: Your IT support team Copyright Â©2022 Oregon State University Disclaimer
