Since March 23rd, 2020 the Division of Student Engagement and Well-Being and Office of Financial Aid has provided more than 4,300 grants totaling $6,687,437.00 to Georgia Tech students. These efforts were supported by partners all over campus and were focused on making sure that Georgia Tech students had the resources they needed to succeed throughout the COVID 19 pandemic. However, the HEERF III Student Relief Grant was always designed to be temporary and the funding reflected that. Therefore, it is no longer accepting new applications. If you have applied for a HEERF III Student Relief grant and are awaiting a decision, your application will be processed as normal. If you are still in need there are several resources on campus to help you. For more information on the resources available through the Division of Student Engagement and Well-Being, please visit our website here: https://studentlife.gatech.edu/content/get-help-now.
