Jerry was draped across his couch with care In hopes that Melissa would never be there. Rochelle was nestled all snug in her bed With visions of poetry dancing in her head. And Jeff with his guitar and I with my cat Had just settled down for overdue nightcaps. When out on the quad there arose such a clatter Jerry sprang from his couch to see what was the matter. Away to the window he flew like a flash Tore open the shades and took a deep gasp. The heat from the room escaped with a blow And melted the snow over objects below. When what to his wondering eyes should appear But a miniature keyboard and eight tiny paper shears. With a nice young typist with a head like a babe He know in a moment it must be our Gabe. More rapid than eagles those documents they came And he whistled and shouted and called them by name! Now Compliance! Now, Assessment! Now, Learning Experience! On, Standards! On Planning! On Student Experience! To the trash can you go! I want to shred you all! Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all! As dry leaves before the wild hurricane fly, When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky, So up to the clouds the papers they flew, With Katie in tow, and our Gary too.
