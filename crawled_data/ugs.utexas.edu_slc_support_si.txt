You are invited to attend one of two identical, voluntary SI sessions each week at any point in the semester. Please check your course’s Canvas page to view session times. SI leaders plan collaborative activities and you should expect to actively participate, working together with your peers and SI leaders to discover and construct knowledge and understanding in a relaxed and engaging setting. Students who regularly attend SI sessions typically score a half to a full letter grade higher than those who don’t! Spring 2022 update: Supplemental Instruction sessions will be conducted remotely via Zoom at least through January 31. Find information about the dates, times, and accessing the SI Session on your course’s Canvas page.
