September 10, 2019 AFP Habitat, the largest pension fund manager in Chile by assets managed, has enlisted a group of Columbia’s School of Professional Studies students under the Capstone Project to contribute to three strategic projects. “We have always known about these Capstone projects, and we’ve wanted to work together [with students] for some time,” says Felipe Vargas (MMF ’12), quantitative strategist at AFP Habitat. “Fortunately, this initiative has now materialized with the fundamental help of the Santiago Global Center.” Along with the students, the majority of which are studying a Master of Science in Applied Analytics, Vargas is working with another Columbia alumnus, José Manuel Peña (MAA’17) on developing three machine learning projects that involve several areas of the company. “Our idea is to strengthen long-term ties and alliances with academia, creating instances of collaboration to generate new ideas, develop applied projects and face today’s industry challenges,” Vargas said. The projects are currently under development, the first stage of which is slated to last through the second half of the year.
