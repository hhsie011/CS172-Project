As we drill down into specific areas of self-care, we’ll experience three specific techniques, one each for body, mind, and spirit, for calming the nervous system and re-writing looping thoughts and beliefs that keep us stuck. These include a grounding meditation, 4–4-4-4 breathing, and a limiting beliefs written exercise.
