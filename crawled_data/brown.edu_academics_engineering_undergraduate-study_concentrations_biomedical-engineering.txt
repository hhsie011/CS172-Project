Bachelor of Arts Concentration Options Declaring a Concentration Biomedical Engineering Sc.B. in Biomedical Engineering Biomedical engineering is a dynamic and growing field that applies engineering principles to the fields of biology and medicine. Biomedical engineers design new drugs; genetically engineered organisms; medical implants; and medical instruments. They also use their understanding of biology to re-invent man-made materials and products. The biomedical engineering curriculum at Brown prepares students for careers in biomedical engineering and biotechnology, as well as careers in diverse areas such as medicine, law, business, and health care delivery. BME students master the fundamentals of both the physical sciences and life sciences, and learn to apply these principles to a broad spectrum of problems in biomedical engineering. The biomedical engineering program is administered jointly by the Division of Biology and Medicine and the School of Engineering under the umbrella of the Center for Biomedical Engineering. Students have access to the programs and facilities of both departments as well as Brown's affiliated hospitals. This structure makes biomedical engineering a unique program at Brown, and enables students to participate in a range of exciting interdisciplinary research projects. The concentration has the following general structure: The interdisciplinary core program for biomedical engineering, taken in the first four semesters. The BME core shares much of the content of the other engineering programs, but includes additional courses in biology and chemistry, and has a different focus in mathematics Four required upper-engineering courses Three biomedical engineering electives A capstone design course Four approved courses in the humanities and social sciences Sample course plan For complete requirements, please see the University Bulletin.
