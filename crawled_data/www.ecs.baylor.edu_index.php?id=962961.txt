Give Now Cyber Security With an ever-flowing stream of devices networking around the world comes a flood of vulnerabilities - including those that trail from device to device - making cyber security an increasing priority for governments, private companies and even members of the public. "Computing has infiltrated all aspects of people's lives. When I started it was pretty much mid-sized and large companies," said professor of computer science Dr. Jeff Donahoo. Cyber Security is one of the fastest growing industries. And we hope to prepare our students through a future Cyber Security program in Computer Science. Give Now Capstone Design Fund Design experience funds allow Baylor Engineering and Computer Science students to engage with experts in specialized fields to provide constructive feedback and concept evaluation of relevant Capstone Projects. Give Now ECS Student Organization Fund Many companies hire students based on their student organization participation. Being involved in a student organization gives students leadership, project management and team collaboration experience. This fund helps prepare our students for a successful future. Give Now Engineers with a Mission Since 2004, teams of engineering and computer science students have traveled to Kenya, Honduras, Rwanda and Haiti to design and provide sustainable solutions, such as solar power and heating, water filtration, windmills to pump water and hydro-turbine aeration, to these developing countries. Give Now Engineering Scholarship Fund Many students determine wether or not to continue education based on financial aid. This fund provides assistance to deserving students who are majoring in engineering. Give Now Computer Science Scholarship Fund In a world ever changing to be more technologically based, emphasis should be placed on those looking to aid the revolution. Similar to the engineering fund, this scholarship fund provides assistance to deserving students attending Baylor University, Waco, Texas, with preference given to students who are pursuing a major in computer science. Give Now Student Scholarships Few investments more directly impact the life of a Baylor Engineering and Computer Science student than a scholarship. For many, it's a determining factor in their decision to come to Baylor. Scholarships touch students' lives in a powerful and personal way - for many, it is the only way they can access a Baylor education. Our students fill the gap between their unmet financial needs and their access to Baylor through federal student loans, personal loans, or through out-of-pocket resources.
