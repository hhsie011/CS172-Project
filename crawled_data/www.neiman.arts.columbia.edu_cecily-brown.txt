In The Crow and Kitten, birds, cats, rabbits and other creatures reveal themselves through a skein of gestural marks built up with multiple layers of offset lithography. The key plate image of What the Shepherd Saw - whose title is taken from a short story by Thomas Hardy - is pulled from a lithographic stone printed with light Arcadian colors created from an offset procedure. Brown’s larger Untitled lithographs explore a new way of working in which she layered found images to create an aesthetic similar to her paintings but with fewer visible brushstrokes. Cecily Brown (b. 1969, London, England) received her BA in fine arts from the Slade School of Art at the University College of London. She has lived and worked in New York City since the early 1990s. Brown has had numerous solo exhibitions at institutions including the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington and Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid. Her work was the focus of a mid-career retrospective at The Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humlebæk, Denmark in 2018-19. Brown's paintings, prints, and drawings are in a number of museum collections, including the Tate Gallery, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Albright Knox Art Gallery, Whitney Museum of American Art, Museum of Modern Art in Frankfurt, and the Sintra Museu de Arte Moderna in Portugal.
