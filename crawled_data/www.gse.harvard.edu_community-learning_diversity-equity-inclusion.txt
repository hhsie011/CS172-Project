Instagram Community Learning Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion The Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE) is committed to recruiting, cultivating, engaging, and encouraging a diverse and vibrant community of faculty, staff, and students. Diversity can be multivariate, intersectional, and complex, and at HGSE, we define a diverse population to include a wide range of racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender identities; economic and geographic backgrounds; physical abilities; life, school, and career experiences; and political, religious, and personal beliefs. These and other important attributes reflect the complexity of our increasingly diverse student body, local community, and worldwide population. "At HGSE, we aspire to be a richly diverse place where everyone can thrive as their authentic selves and do their best work to improve the world through education. Realizing this vision requires our collective energy, humanity, creativity, and dedication." Bridget Long Dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education We believe in the importance of education for all. Our community recognizes the inherent worth and value of each person regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, political views, immigration status, ability, socioeconomic status, and other identities or characteristics. While we encourage research and debate on how best to accomplish the goals of education, we are committed to this work regardless of identity or background. We recognize the benefits of diversity and understand that diversity must be joined with equity, inclusion, and a sense of belonging for all members of our community. Including a diverse set of backgrounds and perspectives at HGSE is essential to our ability to engage in meaningful teaching and practice, conduct relevant and pioneering research, and have a positive impact on the larger field. We are committed to learning and supporting each other in our growth around the issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We all share a responsibility to respect the rights, differences, and dignity of others, and to sustain an environment that is conducive to fostering the highest levels of learning for all. This requires us to carefully examine our own practices and strive to create the kind of community we wish to see in other settings.
