Our program intends to enrich the high school experience, not replace it. Students who take classes at Georgia Tech usually continue taking classes and participating in activities and organizations in their high school communities. Distance Math and On-Campus Dual Enrollment programs admit students for fall semester only. If you are admitted for fall semester, you may enroll in spring semester courses pending satisfactory academic performance in the fall. Distance Computer Science admits students for Fall or Spring semesters. That program includes one-semester courses and students may take one or more. Summer courses are not available.
