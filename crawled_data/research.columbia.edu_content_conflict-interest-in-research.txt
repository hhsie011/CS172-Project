Individual COI: The University recognizes the importance of relationships between researchers and commercial organizations, and seeks to encourage such relationships. However, the financial incentives that accompany such relationships may lead to financial conflicts of interest that have the potential to create real or apparent bias in research. The Policy on (Individual) Financial Conflicts of Interest in Research describes University processes for (i) disclosure and review of individual researcher’s financial interests, and (ii) addressing potential conflicts of interest that may arise between these interests and University research. Institutional COI: The University’s relationships with external entities, including through gifts, business ventures, royalty payments and equity from licensing intellectual property, are essential to advancing scientific frontiers and enabling commercial development, but cannot be allowed to compromise, or appear to compromise, the integrity of the University’s research, the academic mission, or the safety of research participants. The Policy on Institutional Conflict of Interest in Research describes University processes for disclosure and review of financial interests held by the University (and by certain institutional officials) and management of potential conflicts that may arise between these interests and University research.
