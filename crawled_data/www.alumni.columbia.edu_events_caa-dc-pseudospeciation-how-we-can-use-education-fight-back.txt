Rather, it tends to originate from "pseudospeciation," a deep-seeded tendency to dehumanize out-groups based on differences in race, religion, language, and more, as identified by the iconic psychologist Erik Erikson in 1966. What he and other social scientists have identified since is a vulnerability, prone to manipulation by forces that range from charismatic community leaders to media-savvy operations and autocratic government regimes. There is but one cure: Education. Please join us for a conversation with Prof. Amra Sabic-El-Rayess 04'SIPA 10'GSAS 10'TC 12'GSAS 12'TC, BA Brown, the author of the highly acclaimed book THE CAT I NEVER NAMED , as she draws on her own experience of survival in the Bosnian genocide by her sheer determination, but also with a help of a cat. Throughout her struggle, she never wavered in her core faith that it is our own choice to let 'othering' infect our judgment and worse inform our actions, or to inhibit it. And to inhibit the worse angels of our nature, it takes an education; Sabic-El-Rayess will share how that faith became her sense of purpose in life to educate others about making the right choice, the choice the survival of human societies depends on.
