The program provides each student flexibility in exploring across multiple disciplines to learn design methods, theory, and application that drive the design process. The core of the degree program is a series of lectures, seminars, and studios. Students have hands-on experiences grappling with design challenges that vary in complexity and scale. Courses are taught by faculty from multiple design disciplines. Seniors complete a capstone project, called Launchpad, and a portfolio and professional development course in preparation for graduate school or the job market. The program works well with a second major or a minor, can be completed on a part-time schedule, and is transfer-friendly. Students with transfer credit should speak to academic advisor about how these credits can apply to degree requirements. The curriculum developed out of a shared philosophy across the college's disciplines that designers have the capacity to think strategically and creatively about society's increasing economic, social and environmental challenges. Innovation and entrepreneurship are encouraged, integrated, and valued. Our graduates pursue a wide range of professional career paths in design practice, digital media and entrepreneurship. Upon completion, students may enter graduate programs in the design professions or other fields in which design thinking, skills in making, and critical analysis are valued.
