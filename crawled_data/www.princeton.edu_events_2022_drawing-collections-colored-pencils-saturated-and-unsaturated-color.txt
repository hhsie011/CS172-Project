Weekly classes are taught by artist-instructor Barbara DiLorenzo over Zoom. Each week’s lesson is inspired by a work in the Museum’s collections. This live art-making class is inspired by Kubo Shunman’s 窪俊満 Horned Owl on Flowering Branch. A horned owl sits on a branch covered with embossed, lightly colored magnolias in bloom.
