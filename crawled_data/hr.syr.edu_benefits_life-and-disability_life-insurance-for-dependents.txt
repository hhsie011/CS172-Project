You can choose coverage for your spouse/same-sex domestic partner in the amounts of $10,000 or $20,000 without providing a Statement of Health. Coverage levels of $40,000, $60,000, $80,000 and $100,000 may also be elected; however, your spouse/same-sex domestic partner must complete and submit a Statement of Health form and have it approved by MetLife. You are automatically the beneficiary of spouse/same-sex domestic partner coverage. Dependent Life Insurance for Children Link You can purchase life insurance coverage for your eligible unmarried dependent child(ren) under the age of 26 in the amount of $10,000, provided they are dependent upon you for support and maintenance. Disabled children over age 26 may be eligible for continued coverage, if they were disabled prior to their 26th birthday, were previously enrolled in coverage and MetLife approves the application. Contact HR Shared Services to request the application, which must be completed by you and your child’s physician. Coverage on your child cannot exceed the amount of your combined basic and supplemental life coverage. A MetLife Statement of Health is not required to purchase this coverage. You are automatically the beneficiary of your life insurance coverage for your child(ren). Please note the following: If you and your spouse/same-sex domestic partner are Syracuse University employees, you both may purchase coverage on the same child(ren) and you both would receive a benefit payment should a child pass away. Your eligible dependent cannot also be eligible for coverage as a University employee. Calculating Your Cost for Spouse/Same-Sex Domestic Partner Life Insurance Link Your premium costs are based on your spouse/partner’s age and will be automatically adjusted as necessary during the calendar year to reflect changes as needed. Premiums are paid through after-tax payroll deduction. Find the rate based on your spouse/same-sex domestic partner’s age in the chart below (for example, the rate for a 48-year-old is $0.13). Divide the desired coverage level by 1,000 (for example, $80,000 divided by 1,000 = $80) Multiply by the rate ($80 x $0.13 = $10.40). This is the monthly amount. To determine the amount that will be deducted from each paycheck, multiply by 12 and divide by the number of checks you receive in a year: ◦Paid weekly over the fiscal year: 52 pays ◦Paid weekly over the academic year: 37 pays ◦Paid semi-monthly over the fiscal year: 24 pays ◦Paid semi-monthly over the academic year: 18 pays Spouse/Partner Age Rates Monthly Cost per Thousand Under age 25 $0.043 25 through 29 $0.051 30 through 34 $0.068 35 through 39 $0.077 40 through 44 $0.10 45 through 49 $0.13 50 through 54 $0.196 55 through 59 $0.366 60 through 64 $0.561 65 through 69 $1.08 Age 70 and up $1.921 Your Cost for Child(ren) Life Insurance Link Your cost per paycheck is based on each pay schedule. The cost is the same regardless of how many children you cover. Premiums are paid through after-tax payroll deduction and is $0.537 per month.
