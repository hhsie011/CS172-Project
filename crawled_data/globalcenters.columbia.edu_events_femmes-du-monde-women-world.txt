Some of the composers are already internationally well known, such as Kaija Saariaho, Elzbieta Sikora or Chaya Czernowin, or rising stars, like the Austrian Olga Neuwirth, who allowed Greffin-Klein to transcribe her solo viola piece for violin, or young composers beginning their careers, like Farnaz Modarresifar, a young Iranian who is also a virtuoso santur player. Four composers wrote works especially for this program. The Canadian composer Zosha Di Castri, Francis Goelet Assistant Professor of Composition at Columbia University and Fellow of the Institute for Ideas and Imagination, will speak with Greffin-Klein about her work, Patina, after the concert. Alexandra Greffin-Klein is a French violinist who performs regularly in Europe, the United States, and Japan. Since 2009 she has focused especially on contemporary music, working closely with composers all around the world as a member of various chamber music ensembles (Cairn, Alternance, Multilatérale, Itinéraire, Sillage, and since 2012 a permanent member of Court-Circuit), as well as a soloist. She appeared at the Darmstadt Festival in 2010 and received in 2012 “5 Diapasons” for her recording of Raphaël Cendo’s string quartet, In vivo. Philippe Hurel dedicated to her his new violin solo piece Trait, which she premiered in Paris in September 2014 and recorded in 2016. This CD won the prestigious Grand Prix de l’Academie Charles Cros, was awarded 5 stars in Diapason magazine and was listed amongst the 5 best CD’s of 2016 by France Musique (French National radio). Later that year she had her first solo recital tour in the US and performed Jonathan Harvey's Concerto with the Slee Sinfonietta conducted by Julien Leroy. At the 2017 MUSICA festival, she performed a recital with her favorite partner, cellist Alexis Descharmes, and premiered Antonio Tules Violin Concerto, conducted by Jean Deroyer.
