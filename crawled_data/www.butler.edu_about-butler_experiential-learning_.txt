We believe experiencing is foundational to learning. So you’ll be applying what you learn right away—in class and out. About Butler Menu Maps & Directions At a Glance Graduate Outcomes Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion Community & Engagement Office of the President Strategic Direction Give to Butler Mascot Blue IV Careers This is not a test. The time you spend learning on campus is foundational. But we’re big believers in the idea that the lessons that make the biggest impact come from real-world experience. You’ll get those opportunities from your earliest days here, as you conduct research, hold internships, and get involved in Indianapolis, your new city. It may mean working about as hard as you ever have. But when it’s for something you love, well, it won’t feel much like work at all. Read About Our Hands-On Experiences Big city, bigger classroom Indianapolis is the 17th-largest city in the United States. When you plant your flag here, you’ll do it alongside major healthcare organizations and tech firms, fast-growing startups, and lots of other companies, big and small. When we forge partnerships with those businesses, you’ll get a lot from the relationship. But it’s a two-way street: Butler know-how has fueled Indianapolis’ growth for generations. We’re an integral part of the city. And enthusiastic, ready-to-go people like you are part of the reason why Indianapolis is regularly ranked among the best places for young professionals to live and work. Pause/Play Internships Put Your Lessons to Work Here’s a secret: Employers love students with on-the-job experience because they get a head start on lessons that can’t be taught, like problem solving and bouncing back when things don’t go exactly to plan. (Free advice: Nothing goes exactly to plan.) More than 75 percent of Butler students hold at least one internship before they graduate—and if you’re a business student, you’ll have two. That pays off: Every year, more than 2,500 companies knock on our door seeking students for internships and jobs. Service-Learning Care Starts Here There are colleges where you can spend four years and not know there’s a world outside campus. Butler isn’t one of those places. We’ve built community into the curriculum. Both our Indianapolis Community Requirement and Social Justice and Diversity courses give you a deeper look into your home in Indianapolis, and encourage connection with the people and places throughout the city. (Don’t be surprised if you find yourself volunteering long after these classes are done. When you get to know Indy, you’ll want to be part of it.) Undergraduate Research Ask and Answer The difference between reading about research and conducting it yourself is like the difference between taking a guided tour of a place and setting off on your own: Both are valuable. But one gives you a chance to go where your curiosity takes you. At Butler, exploration is part of the deal. Even as an undergrad, you’ll have a chance to work directly with faculty members as part of a small team, conducting primary research on topics that matter. Our students have asked big-impact questions, like how babies with hearing impairments interact with their parents and how feminist ideals are portrayed in the media. And you’ll get the chance to share your findings on campus and beyond, at conferences and in papers. Study Abroad Come to Indy, See the World We love Indianapolis. But the world is a big place. And there’s no better time to see it than while you’re in college. So get your passport: We offer more than 200 study abroad programs in over 60 countries. Maybe you’ll work full-time in China. Or complete a leadership program in London. In fact, our Global Adventures in the Liberal Arts program is ranked among the country’s 50 best study-abroad programs.
