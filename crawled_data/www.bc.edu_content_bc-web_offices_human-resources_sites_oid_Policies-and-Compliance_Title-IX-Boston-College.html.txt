Sexual harassment or sexual misconduct of any kind is antithetical to the mission of Boston College and the values it espouses and will be responded to accordingly, whether a complaint involves allegations of sexual misconduct by faculty, staff, student, or a third party. The University strives to eliminate sexual harassment, prevent its occurrence, and address its effects. In this regard, Boston College has several individuals who serve as Title IX coordinators. These individuals serve as resources for students, faculty, and staff within the Boston College community and oversee the University's response to Title IX complaints.
