The University Store makes shopping for your textbooks easy. We work directly with OSU faculty members to make sure we have in stock exactly what you need to be successful in your classes. If convenience is your thing, ordering your textbooks from the University Store online is easy, plus you can have them delivered for a minimal shipping fee or choose our fast, free and convenient in-store pickup option. BUY YOUR TEXTBOOKS ONLINE Unlike shopping anywhere else, students who are enrolled for the current academic term and who do not have a hold on their bursar account may charge up to $1,500 per semester at the University Store for textbooks and other academically-related materials. Charges for the fall semester begin Monday, August 1, 2022, and charges for the spring semester begin Monday, December 19, 2022. Students have the option of charging textbooks to their bursar account both in store and online. If you are purchasing your textbooks online and meet the requirements for charging, the bursar charge button will automatically be displayed as an option at checkout once students have logged in with their O-Key credentials. Drop a class? Need to return a book? If you purchase your textbooks from the University Store and later find you don't actually need that textbook for whatever reason you can return it within the first 10 days of the semester during the fall or spring, or within the first five days of the semester during the summer, for a full refund as long as you have your receipt. Therefore, we recommend you not write in or unwrap any book until you are sure you will be keeping it for the semester, just in case you need to return it. Don't forget, the last day for full textbook refunds during the spring semester at the University Store is Monday, January 24, 2022. All refunds will be given according to the initial method of payment only. WE GIVE YOU MORE. Why should you buy your textbooks from the University Store? Because the University Store goes beyond the classroom. When you shop at the University Store 100% of your purchases benefit Oklahoma State University and its students. The University Store is owned and operated by Oklahoma State University, and unlike other privately-owned bookstores or online retailers, every purchase made in the University Store stays on campus to fund student programs and services, keeping student fees to a minimum. For instance, the University Store funds almost 75% of the operations of the OSU Student Union, which was recently named the #1 Most Amazing Campus Student Union by bestcollegereviews.org. We recognize that students have a lot of choices when it comes to purchasing their textbooks. We only hope you will make the choice to shop at the one store that gives you more – in more ways than one! The University Store is owned and operated by Oklahoma State University, and every purchase made in the University Store directly benefits the university.
