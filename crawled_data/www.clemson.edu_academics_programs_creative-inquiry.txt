Creative Inquiry & Undergraduate Research Creative Inquiry has come to define Undergraduate Research at Clemson University. It's small-group learning for 20,000. It's the imaginative combination of engaged learning and undergraduate research, and it is undergraduate research unique to Clemson University. Students take on problems that spring from their own curiosity, from a professor's challenge or from the pressing needs of the world around them. Team-based investigations are led by a faculty mentor and typically span two to four semesters. Students take ownership of their projects and take the risks necessary to solve problems and get answers. Topics are boundless. Students often find themselves presenting their work at national conferences, fielding questions from professionals. This invaluable experience produces exceptional graduates. Our Creative Inquiry participants develop critical thinking skills, learn to solve problems as a team and hone their communication and presentation skills. What does it take? Commitment and curiosity. You'll need the desire to be creative, to work with a group of peers for several semesters and to be mentored by a faculty member or advanced graduate student. Course credit is given.
