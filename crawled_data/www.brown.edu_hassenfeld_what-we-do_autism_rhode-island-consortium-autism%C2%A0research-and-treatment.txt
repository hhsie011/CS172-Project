RI-CART has evolved into a unique, public-private partnership, bringing together the state’s leading experts on autism research, education, health and advocacy. RI-CART’s long-term goal involves enrolling all Rhode Islanders with ASD or related neurodevelopmental disorders into a research registry by 2020. This will pave the way toward gaining a big picture view of all those affected by autism and neurodevelopmental disorders statewide. RI-CART connects families and individuals with ASD to researchers, thus creating innovative research and a big picture understanding of those affected by ASD in Rhode Island.
