Visit the Union website 301 Student Union(405) 744-5231osuunion@okstate.edu Rooted in tradition Our traditions have connected more than 240,000 alumni across the globe. Life happens at the Union. The Oklahoma State University Student Union has served as the main campus gathering place since 1950 and today more than one million visitors pass through its doors every year. OSU President Henry Bennett’s 1937 campus plan included a union that would become the hub of campus life and a venue for public use. Students shared that vision and funded the $4.3 million project through a self-imposed tax. The building has been expanded and upgraded through the years. Most recently, a $68 million renovation was completed in 2012 making the hollowed Student Union grander than ever. The project, which was officially endorsed by the students through their increased student fee gift, ensured the continued tradition of the iconic building. The renovated Union expanded and upgraded many of its existing services as well as added new resources to meet the needs of many of today’s college students. With more than 650,000 square-feet, the Union is the country’s most comprehensive, with a hotel, fine dining, parking garage and a long list of services, including shopping, dining, student services, Leadership & Campus Life, student lounges and meeting rooms. Throughout its more than 65 years of operation, the Union has remained as vibrant and as relevant to the OSU community and the campus mission as it did when its doors opened in the early 1950s. Though its furnishings have changed, and it has seen numerous additions and renovations, one thing has remained constant – the vital role it plays in the OSU experience.
