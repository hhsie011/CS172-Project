The critical role of parents is often overlooked, and notably absent from anti-Islamophobia education initiatives. This presentation will put forward a peace education curriculum model to address Islamophobia amongst parents and caregivers in the US. Incorporating Islam into the Mainstream Education System: A Strategy to Counter Islamophobia Student Presenters: Ayelet Hillel, Maximilian Rojas-Domke, Tianxiang Zhu A key factor leading to Islamophobic views are misinformed narratives around Islam and Muslims that are often promoted in popular media. The education system is vital in deconstructing negative perceptions of Islam among non-Muslims and reconstructing inclusive narratives. By incorporating the study of Islam as part of the mainstream curriculum, the education system can raise the level of understanding regarding Muslim culture and faith among the general population, to foster mutual tolerance and understanding. The presentations will be followed by reflections and questions from discussants.
