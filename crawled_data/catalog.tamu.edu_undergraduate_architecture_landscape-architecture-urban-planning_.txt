Landscape architecture as a discipline is devoted to understanding and managing the human and environmental forces that change the landscape. Landscape architects plan and design places for the health, safety, and welfare of citizens through systematic decision-making that integrates science, art, and technology. Individual and community quality of life are enhanced by a design process to improve, protect, and create ecologically sustainable, socially equitable, and economically feasible landscapes. Landscape architects work in urban, suburban and wilderness environments. Our graduates have gained distinction for projects as varied in scale as private gardens, residential communities, urban plazas, college campuses, park facilities and regional conservation plans. The Bachelor in Landscape Architecture (BLA) program is nationally accredited as a professional degree program. The mission of the program is to prepare students to become professional landscape architects in private and public sector practice. Our educational goal is to produce graduates motivated to be leaders in the field and professionals who are intellectually active, broadly-educated citizens and life-long learners. Urban and Regional Planning The Bachelor of Science in Urban and Regional Planning degree program emphasizes the social, economic, cultural and natural factors that govern how communities and society are shaped. Coursework provides students with the knowledge and skills needed to develop solutions to community and regional growth and development issues that face our state and nation. Students have an opportunity to specialize in specific aspects of community and regional planning and development issues along with internship and service-learning experiences locally, nationally, and/or internationally.
