That’s why we offer a pre-evaluation of credit that will help you chart a clear pathway toward a UofL degree. Once you submit your request, we will evaluate your prior coursework and send you a personalized report that will show you: • Your course-by-course credits and how they will transfer • Contact information for an academic advisor who can explain your degree plan in detail • Contact information for a career counselor who can help determine what degree will lead you to the career goal you want All three services are being offered prior to submitting an admissions application and paying the mandatory $25 fee. We will email your pre-evaluation of credit to you within 5 days of your request. Pre-evaluations at the start of a semester, during the months of August and December, may be delayed due to our processing of current applicants. For a complete pre-evaluation and accurate advising, we request that you send us unofficial transcripts for each school you have attended. For example, if you have attended three institutions we request that you send us three unofficial transcripts, one from each institution. These documents, including your unofficial transcript(s), will not be retained for application use. Pre-evaluations cannot be completed for international credit,or students who have already earned a previous bachelor's degree.
