Our graduates include archivists, arts administrators, art teachers, communications managers, consultants, cultural planners, curators, development writers, interpretive guides, marketing coordinators, museum curators and educators, nonprofit business managers, and oyster farmers. They work in education, interpretation, research, and administrative offices of cities, historic sites, museums, parks, universities, and more. A few have gone on to pursue a Ph.D. or an additional M.A. degree. The careers of our graduates very much reflect their interests and the ways in which they have shaped the program to create professional opportunities.
