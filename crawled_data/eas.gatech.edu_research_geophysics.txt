Our research includes theoretical analyses, numerical modeling, observational studies, and laboratory experiments. The research addresses issues of fundamental understanding of the dynamics of the solid earth system, and associated hazards from earthquakes, volcanism, and tsunamis as well as cosmogenic geochronology, geomorphology and electro-magnetic interactions of planetary bodies. Solid Earth Sciences research is inherently interdisciplinary and is conducted in collaboration with civil and environmental engineering, physics, geochemistry, geology, and microbiology. Learn More.
