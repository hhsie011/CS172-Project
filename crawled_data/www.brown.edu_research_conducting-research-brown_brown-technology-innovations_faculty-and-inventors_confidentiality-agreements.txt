Confidentiality Agreements Brown Technology Innovations assists faculty with confidentiality agreements (CDAs), enabling investigators to provide confidential or proprietary information to third parties. Under certain limited circumstances you might also be asked to enter into CDAs in order to receive confidential information from others. In either case, our team negotiates these agreements, which are aimed at protecting Brown’s rights and those of our investigators such as the right to publish. Brown Technology Innovations negotiates and signs these agreements on behalf of Brown. For further information on CDAs or to implement the process, please contact Brown Technology Innovations at [email protected] or (401) 863-7499.
