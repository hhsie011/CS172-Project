We encourage applicants with disabilities, who contribute to a diverse Dartmouth community, to apply for admission with the expectation that reasonable accommodations and access to Guarini's graduate programs, including curricular and co-curricular pursuits, will be provided. Guarini School of Graduate and Advanced Studies and Dartmouth College are committed to ensuring equal access under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as amended, and Sections 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Applicants may disclose disability prior to admission but are not required to, nor will disability status be considered in the admissions process. Disability disclosure can be made at any time during your enrollment; however, students are encouraged to engage the interactive process and request accommodations prior to the start of classes or as soon as a disability is identified during enrollment. Early notification allows for a smooth transition and the implementation of auxiliary services or modifications in a timely manner. Students are further encouraged to make use of reasonable accommodations and the supports available throughout their enrollment. Getting Started Accommodations are determined on an individual basis through an interactive process including the student and Guarini and are based on federal law and Dartmouth College guidelines. Assistant Dean Gary Hutchins works with Guarini students to determine reasonable accommodations and coordinates the provision of accommodations for them.Read More Rights and Responsibilities Learn about student rights and responsibilities here.Read More Injuries and Temporary Conditions Temporary conditions are usually not substantial enough to be considered a disability as defined by law.
