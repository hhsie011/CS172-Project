Geochemists investigate low-temperature and high-temperature processes operating on scales that range from atoms, to the Earth, to the solar system. Low-temperature geochemistry focuses on chemical and biochemical processes on and near Earth's surface, including environmental geochemistry, pollution in the ocean and freshwater bodies, and how the Earth’s geochemical record reflects past climate conditions. High-temperature geochemistry focuses on the formation and evolution of the Earth and other planets, magma formation and properties, volcanic activity, and metamorphism. Both AB and ScB degrees are offered; the ScB requires more (19) courses, including a research course. DEEPS provides a highly collaborative learning environment that emphasizes process-oriented, hands-on approaches in the classroom, in labs and on field trips. There are many opportunities for students to do research working with faculty, graduate students, and researchers. The degree builds students’ skills in critical thinking, written and oral communication, data analysis and modeling, and applying systems approaches to problem solving, which prepare students for a wide variety of careers.
