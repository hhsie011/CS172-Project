Every month, we invite middle and high school students to join us for an afternoon of experiments in different fields of science. We want to inspire everyone’s inner scientist by showing that science is all around us and that exploring the world through STEM is really fun! From demonstrating how electronic circuits work to exploring animal behavior, we encourage students to engage scientifically with their world.
