Detail of the foot of Simurgh’s mountain, f. 63b of the Shah Tahmasp (Houghton) Shahnama, 16th c. HOLLIS Record Fine Arts Library. Stuart Cary Welch, Jr. (1928-2008) was a celebrated curator, lecturer, and collector of Islamic and Indian art. His professional positions included special consultant in charge of the Department of Islamic Art at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, a post he held from 1979 to 1987, and honorary keeper, then curator of Islamic art at Harvard University’s Fogg Museum from 1956 to 2008. Stuart Cary Welch, c. 1994-1995. Courtesy of the Welch Family. In the course of his long career in the latter half of the 20th century, Welch assembled over 60,000 35mm slides for his research and teaching, documenting his unique access to private and public art collections from across the world. This includes the photographs he used to create his most famous work, a two-volume concordance of the now-dispersed Shahnama of Shah Tahmasp (colloquially known as the Houghton Shahnama). Though his final publication contained few color images, most of the manuscript paintings are reproduced in full color, and sometimes in situ, in the collection now held by the Fine Arts Library.
