Established in 2010, the program formalized the Consortium’s long-standing principle that no one with a bona fide research agenda and an inability to contribute should go without data (DiPersio & Cieri, 2016). Since 2010, 133 recipients from 33 countries have received 200 corpora valued at over USD $338,000. Program results have aided new developments in multiple fields and most recipients have stated that the data received was vital to their work. Special thanks for this program goes to LDC’s members who subsidize the program through their membership fees. Students can learn more about the scholarship application process, requirements and biannual deadlines on our Data Scholarship page.
