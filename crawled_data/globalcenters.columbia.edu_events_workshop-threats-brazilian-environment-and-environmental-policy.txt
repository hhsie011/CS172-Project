1:00 PM Columbia Law School, New York City (Jerome Greene Annex) The workshop “Threats to the Brazilian Environment and Environmental Policy” will be organized by the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University and Pace University Law School in partnership with the Columbia University Global Center in Rio de Janeiro. The workshop will take place on November 13 at the Columbia University Law School in New York City from 8:30AM through 1:00 PM. Faced with a reversal of extant environmental practices, members of the law faculties of Law at Columbia and Pace are convening this workshop in order to increase understanding and raise awareness in the United States of the scope and severity of the environmental crisis in Brazil. We seek to gather scholars and activists from a variety of disciplines, in addition to the law, to examine critically and from a comparative U.S.-Brazil perspective, the alarming situation in Brazil. In addition to the scholarly merits of the Workshop, the organizers anticipate the subsequent production and dissemination of op-ed articles and a White Paper.
