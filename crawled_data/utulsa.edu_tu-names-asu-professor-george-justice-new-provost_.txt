Close Search / Academic Affairs / TU names ASU Professor George Justice new provost TU names ASU Professor George Justice new provost January 18, 2022 University of Tulsa President Brad R. Carson has announced the selection of George Justice as TU’s new provost and executive vice president for academic affairs. He will begin his new duties on July 1. George Justice Justice, an English professor at Arizona State University, served as dean of humanities in ASU’s College of Liberal Arts and Sciences from 2013 to 2017. In that position, he had administrative responsibility for three large academic units: the Department of English; School of International Letters and Cultures; and School of Historical, Philosophical, and Religious Studies. He also supervised nine research centers and institutes, including the Virginia G. Piper Center for Creative Writing and Institute for Humanities Research. “I’m incredibly excited to join The University of Tulsa this year. The range of TU’s academic programs already offers unique opportunities combining the strengths of the country’s best research universities and liberal arts colleges,” he said. “I look forward to working with President Carson and the fantastic faculty, staff, and students to make The University of Tulsa the best university between the Rockies and the Mississippi.” Justice is one of the nation’s leading thinkers on issues facing universities and a long-time columnist for The Chronicle for Higher Education. Much of his work focuses on the opportunities for collaboration between faculty and administration – particularly during times of crisis – and the importance of arts and humanities. He is the author of How to be a Dean from Johns Hopkins Press, a consultant on faculty development projects and a renowned scholar of Jane Austen. “George is clearly the right person at the right time to lead The University of Tulsa’s academic initiatives,” Carson said. “I am pleased to welcome another nationally respected administrator to our university as we continue to strive for excellence in all that we do. George’s dedication to students and faculty ensures TU is academically strong and well-positioned for heightened success in the years to come.” Before joining ASU, Justice had been a member of the English faculty at the University of Missouri since 2002, serving as vice provost for advanced studies and dean of the Graduate School from 2010 to 2013. Justice received his bachelor of arts in English from Wesleyan University in 1986 followed by his master’s degree and doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania in 1990 and 1994, respectively. He served as assistant professor of English at Marquette University from 1995 to 2002. Justice’s appointment follows a national search that began last year. He succeeds Janet K. Levit, who served as provost from 2018 until 2020 when she stepped in as interim president. She returned to the faculty in 2021 when Carson was named permanent president of TU.
