Check out the GeoDUG blog: browngeodug.wordpress.com Photo: Undergrad concentrators enjoying the GeoDUG Ice Cream Social, October 2013 GeoDUG Statement of Purpose: We recognize that an academic department’s full educational potential can be realized only when its students are actively engaged in their learning; to this end, the Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences DUG will organize and execute events that serve both to familiarize undergraduates involved in our department with unique opportunities available to them and to maintain a sense of departmental community and interdependence. During the academic year, we host a series of events to provide intra-departmental peer advising on courses, concentrations, study abroad options, and summer opportunities. We also look to bring together the undergraduates concentrating in our four earth, environmental and planetary sciences concentrations – Geo, Geo-Bio, Geo-Chem, and Geo-Phys-Math – for social events and community activities.
