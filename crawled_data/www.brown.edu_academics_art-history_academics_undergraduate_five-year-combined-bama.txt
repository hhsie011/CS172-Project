Students meet with the Undergraduate Supervisor as early as possible in the junior year to review concentration requirements. Students receive the BA at graduation in their senior year, and the MA at graduation the following year. For more information, please contact the Department Undergraduate Advisor, Professor Jeffrey Moser. Requirements for the graduate portion of the combined BA/MA degree The graduate Methods and Practicum courses, offered in sequential Fall semesters. This will mean that the student will take either Methods HIAA 2920 or Practicum, HIAA 2930, whichever is then being offered, in Fall of the senior year. Eight additional courses, of which 6 must be 2000-level graduate seminars or individual reading courses at the graduate level. Combined graduate/undergraduate courses, or undergraduate courses may be counted towards this number in consultation with the student’s sponsoring advisor and the DGS. A thesis or thesis project arrived at in consultation with the student’s advisor. To prepare such a project, typically in their final semester at Brown, the student may register for HIAA 2940, Master’s Qualifying Preparation. The final paper or project may be a perfected version of a seminar paper or project. The paper is with the Graduate School according to their rules for filing an MA thesis.
