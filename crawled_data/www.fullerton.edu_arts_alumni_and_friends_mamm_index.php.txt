In her lifetime, Mulville established and supported over 26 nonprofit organizations, including Music Associates at California State University, now in its fifth decade of philanthropy. MAMM Foundation continued Mulville's extraordinary legacy of giving in Orange County until 2006 when the organization refocused it's mission, becoming MAMM Alliance for the Performing Arts at California State University, Fullerton. The MAMM Foundation Board of Directors additionally gifted the California State Fullerton Philanthropic Foundation with $100,000 to establish the MAMM Foundation Endowment in perpetuity.
