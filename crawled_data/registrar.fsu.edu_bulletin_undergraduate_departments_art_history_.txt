Computer Skills Competency All undergraduates at Florida State University must demonstrate basic computer skills competency prior to graduation. As necessary computer competency skills vary from discipline to discipline, each major determines the courses needed to satisfy this requirement. In art history, undergraduate majors must satisfy this requirement by earning a grade of “C” or higher in ARH 2814 Information Technology for the Art Historian. Oral Communication Competency All undergraduates at Florida State University must demonstrate the ability to transmit clearly ideas and information orally in a way that is appropriate to the topic, purpose, and audience.

In art history, undergraduate majors must satisfy this requirement by earning a grade of “C” or higher in SPC 2067, Communication for Arts and Design, offered through the Department of Art History.
