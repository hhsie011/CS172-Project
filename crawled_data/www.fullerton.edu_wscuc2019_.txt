Skip Navigation California State University, Fullerton Site Menu WSCUC Institutional Report 2019 WSCUC Institutional Report 2019 Cal State Fullerton (CSUF) was initially accredited by Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) - Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC) in 1961. The most recent WSCUC review took place in 2012, which granted CSUF reaffirmation for a seven year period. The issues raised by the 2012 WSCUC review were successfully addressed in the 2015 Interim Report . Our next comprehensive accreditation review is currently taking place, with the onsite visit in Fall 2019. Faculty, staff and students are working diligently to prepare for the visit. Five subcommittees have been formed, and have helped developed the Institutional Report. Please return to this site for updates on the Institutional Report and related reaffirmation of accreditation efforts.
