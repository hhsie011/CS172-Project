This program is only available to the residents living in Whitehall, Esplanade, and Mansfield buildings during the months of April - October. How does the program work? This program is for donations of Large Furniture items only and NOT for items for sale Residents will be responsible for posting their item and description with a minimum of 2 photos Once the item has been adopted, the resident will coordinate drop off of the item to either the Pod outside Esplanade or the basement cage in Whitehall, or directly to the resident who has adopted the item If the item has not been adopted by the time a resident moves out, the resident will be responsible for removing the item to outside storage Items put up for adoption that were constructed inside your unit, need to be disassembled Large furniture items should be disassembled, including bedframes Adopted items must be picked up from the new owners. If the original owners have already vacated, the housing office will meet the new owner to open the vacated unit and retrieve the adopted item Adopted items are on a first come, first serve basis Adopted items will become the property of the new owner and the new owner is responsible for discarding the item if no longer wanted Leaving unclaimed items in your housing unit will result in fines as outlined in your Yale Housing license agreement Please submit one donation form per item Unacceptable Items: Mattresses Upholstered Furniture Broken/Damaged items Sofas - Salvation Army can pick these up at a convenient time prior to your departure: 1-800-728-7825 Yale Housing ask that you be respectful of others and only adopt what you need.
