If a course does not fit exactly into a module, it assumes the module corresponding to the closest class meeting time. For example, a class meeting TTH 11 is assigned module 10 (TTH 10:30*). In situations where the non-standard time falls halfway between two modules, use the module with the later time. For example, a class meeting MWF 9:30 is assigned module 03 (MWF 10). Common Exam Schedule: Some undergraduate courses with multiple sections do not follow the standard exams format; they are grouped together to provide ease in the administration of the exams. Please review the Common Exam tab for those courses to which this type of exam applies. Non-Standard Exam Schedule: All graduate courses or undergraduate courses that meet 4:00 p.m. or later. Students should check their final exam schedule at www.bc.edu/myservices as the end of the semester approaches to confirm the time and room assignments for each of their exams. Faculty should check with their Department Administrator or their web grading sheets posted at www.bc.edu/myservices for the most up-to-date information regarding the meeting day, time, and room assignment for their final exams. NOTE: Exams usually occur in the classroom in which the course is taught, but there may be exceptions. Please check the exam room assignment as your exam approaches.

Non-Standard Exam Schedule Non Standard Exams, as described below, will be held at the usual class meeting time and location unless otherwise posted on the exam schedule. All graduate courses that meet once a week, or, undergraduate courses that start at 4:00 p.m. or later and meet once a week, follow this schedule: Day Class Meets Exam Day and Date Monday Monday, May 16 Tuesday Tuesday, May 10 Wednesday Wednesday, May 11 Thursday Thursday, May 12 All graduate courses that meet more than once a week, or, undergraduate courses that start at 4:00 p.m. or later and meet more than once a week, follow this schedule: Day Class Meets Exam Day and Date Monday/Wednesday Monday, May 16 Monday/Thursday Monday, May 16 Tuesday/Thursday Tuesday, May 10 An undergraduate course that allows graduate student registrations and that meets once a week during the standard class meeting times (8:00 a.m.–3:00 p.m.) assumes the standard undergraduate module corresponding to the closest class meeting time. For example, a Monday 10–11:50 a.m. course would correspond with the M W F 10 class time, which is scheduled for exam module 03 (see Final Exam Schedule listed above). The final exam for a graduate course that meets once a week during standard class meeting times would be on the first class day and time during the week of final exams. As an example, a graduate course that meets once a week on Monday from 10–11:50 a.m. would have its final exam on Monday of exam week at class time. No exams should be scheduled during the Study Days designated on the Academic Calendar. Students are expected to take no more than two final exams in any one day. If a student has three exams scheduled in one day and one of these is a common exam, it is the responsibility of the instructor holding the common exam to give a make-up exam. If a student has three regularly scheduled exams (this can happen if the student is taking a course that meets at 4:00 p.m. or later), the instructor teaching the course outside of the standard time blocks (8:00 a.m.–3:00 p.m.) should provide a make-up exam. In addition, if a student has a conflict between a common exam and a regularly scheduled late afternoon or evening course exam, the responsibility for a make-up lies with the instructor offering the common exam. If there is a storm during the examination period, there is the expectation that exams will be held as scheduled. In the very rare instance that the exam schedule is delayed or postponed due to inclement weather or other emergency situations, the first available of the following days will be used: the Sunday during the exam week, the afternoon of the last exam day, and the day after the last exam day. If rescheduling is necessary, announcements will be made on WBZ, WRKO, and WBMX, and on the Boston College INFO line (617-552-4636). For graduate and professional students, announcements concerning final exams will be made on the same radio stations and on 617-552-INFO. Students are responsible for attending final exams at the scheduled times. In addition, students should consider possible exam rescheduling when making travel plans at the end of the semester.
