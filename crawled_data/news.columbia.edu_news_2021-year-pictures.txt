A picture is worth a thousand words and after a year like 2021, we couldn't be more grateful for a medium that so documents our lives, feelings, and world. Below, take a look back at some of the Columbia News team's visual highlights of 2021, featuring a handful of landmark events, achievements, and campus traditions through the lenses of photographers from across our community. While the country was still very much in the midst of a health crisis in January 2021, it is hard to overstate how vaccination efforts offered a beacon of hope. Here, a Columbia Nursing student who has provided care to patients through the pandemic receives a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.

In addition to having 10+ Columbians compete in the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo this year, two Columbians even had the immense honor of being flag-bearers for their countries during the opening ceremony: Nadia Eke (CC'15), Track & Field, competing for Ghana, and Yasmeen Al Dabbagh (CC'19), Track & Field, competing for Saudi Arabia.

After more than a year apart, festivities in August and September to welcome students back to campus reminded us all how glad we are to be a part of the Columbia community. Photo by Eileen Barroso.
