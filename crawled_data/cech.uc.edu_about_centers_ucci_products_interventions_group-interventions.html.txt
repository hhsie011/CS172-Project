Our well versed team includes practitioners and applied experts from a variety of settings, with experience facilitating and training others to facilitate these group interventions. To best ensure programs are used with fidelity, facilitator training is required prior to implementation. UCCI Curricula In line with our mission, UCCI works closely with content experts to develop and refine a series of Cognitive-Behavioral Intervention (CBI) curricula, and offer agencies to freely adopt our approaches. After being trained to facilitate our curriculum, corrections professionals are permitted to reproduce and photocopy materials needed for individual participation without paying UC ongoing licensing costs. Following is a list of each of our UCCI curriculum. Under the title header we’ve included links to more detailed curricula, training, and evidence-based practice overviews on the specific program.

CBI-CY Curricula Overview CBI-CY Training Overview CBI-CY EBP Overview “The curriculum allows youth to focus in on strategies to enhance emotion regulation and is the perfect combination of identifying/ responding to high risk situations. One of our (individuals) currently in the program stated and I quote “I like the we don’t just learn one skill and move on; we learn more that work with the same problem so that if one way doesn’t work maybe the other will. I also like the role plays because it shows me how to do the steps in real situations.” Jarell D.
