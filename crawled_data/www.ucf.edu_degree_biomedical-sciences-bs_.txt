Explore the Sciences from a Human Perspective and Lead Real-World Change A school in the UCF College of Medicine, the Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences helps advance your understanding of human disease and develop innovative methods of treatment. Offering a wide range of courses in the biomedical sciences, this program provides you with an opportunity to build a diverse background in subjects such as anatomy, molecular biology, cell biology, neurobiology, physiology, microbiology, and immunology. You can choose to study the core degree program or select one of several specific tracks available, including neuroscience, molecular cell biology and molecular microbiology. During your time at UCF, join one of the several biomedical science student organizations or work with faculty on directed research. Areas of research cover many of the world’s most prevalent and serious health programs, including cancer, cardiovascular, molecular microbiology, neurodegenerative, and immunity and pathogenesis diseases. Hands-on experience in addition to your coursework prepares you to enter the workforce after graduating or continue on to schools of medicine, dentistry, veterinary, pharmacy, optometry, podiatry, chiropractic practice, or to train to be a physician assistant. Biomedical Science Tracks: Neuroscience Track Molecular Cell Biology Track Molecular Microbiology Track Highlights A school in the UCF College of Medicine, the Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences includes almost 3,000 undergraduate students. Biomedical science key research divisions include cancer, cardiovascular, immunity and pathogenesis, neuroscience, and molecular microbiology. Occupations in biomedical sciences are projected to grow more than 11% through 2029. The median earnings for biomedical sciences graduates is $89,000.

Students should complete the General Education Program before transferring within the Florida College System or State University System. Grades below "C" in Common Program Prerequisites, Core Requirements and Restricted Electives are not accepted. Students in undergraduate majors within the College of Medicine are expected to consistently make good progress towards their degrees. Therefore, the COM/BSBS Progress Policy mandates that undergraduate students meet the requirements of the policy. Below are the specific requirements of the Progress Policy: Students with 3 withdrawal (W) grades will be placed in a probationary status. Students with 5 withdrawal (W) grades will meet with an advisor from the Knights Major Exploration and Transition Center for selection of a different major. Medical withdrawals are not included in this withdrawal component. Students who earned 5 low grades (C-, D, F, W, NC, U) will be placed on a probationary status and will meet with a peer mentor for major advising. Students who earn more than 8 low grades (C-, D, F, W, NC, U), will meet with an advisor from Knights Major Exploration and Transition Center for selection of a different major. Students with 2 unsuccessful attempts of the same UCF course will be placed on a probationary status and will meet with a peer mentor for major advising. Students with 3 unsuccessful attempts of the same UCF course will meet with an advisor from the Knights Major Exploration and Transition Center for selection of a different major. Students should consult with a BSBS academic advisor at least one time each semester. While many students discover that they have interests in varied disciplines at the University of Central Florida, they are not permitted to pursue two majors within the College of Medicine. College of Medicine students may declare a major and a minor within the college, or pursue a second major or minor in another academic college at UCF. Students are encouraged to meet with an academic advisor to discuss these opportunities.
