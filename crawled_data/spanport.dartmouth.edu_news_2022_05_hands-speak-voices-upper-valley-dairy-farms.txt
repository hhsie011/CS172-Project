The book reveals the ways in which the migrant workers, who are our neighbors and yet who are often distanced by intercultural and linguistic barriers, have sought to build a sense of community. It also makes visible this essential workforce, with a deeper understanding of the vulnerabilities, inequities, and challenges that they face on a daily basis. This journalistic research project, highlights the social impact of FUERZA Farmworkers' Fund (FFF), conceived during the COVID-19 pandemic by three Dartmouth students and the author. It explores the breadth and depth of FFF and how it has assisted in supporting the livelihoods and well-being of migrant communities during a period of intensified isolation. In Hands that Speak: Voices from the Upper Valley Dairy Farms, three narratives converge. That is to say, the voices of three hands that speak. One, the personal narrative of migrant dairy farmworkers: their lives, their stories, their migratory anxieties. They are the protagonists of this work. The second, the narrative of the FUERZA Farmworkers' Fund organization: its conception, its birth, its development, and its hands that speak of the labor of building horizontal relationships with the friends of the dairy farms, non-paternalistically, foreign to the legitimization of hierarchies and welfare. Lastly, the hands that speak that are presented to us in the photographs of Jorge Carlos Álvarez, with a visual narrative in constant motion.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Spanish and Portuguese Undergraduate Overview Frequently Asked Questions Advisors Student Awards and Prizes Programs Hispanic Studies Romance Studies Lusophone Studies Hispanic and Lusophone Studies Honors Thesis Program Thesis Timeline Application Process Thesis Research Funding Past Theses Courses Spanish Portuguese First-Year Seminars (FYS) Placement Information Spanish Portuguese Transfer Credits Alumni Update Foreign Study Overview Programs in Spanish Spanish LSA in Barcelona and Buenos Aires (NEW) Spanish LSA in Santander (NEW) Spanish LSA+ in Barcelona [NEW] Spanish LSA+ in Buenos Aires Spanish FSP in Madrid and Buenos Aires Programs in Portuguese Portuguese LSA+ in São Paulo, Brazil Student Opportunities Overview Apprentice Teacher Information Digital Resources Student Funding AT/Drill Instructor Tryout Dates La Casa Overview Apply Living Guidelines Who We Are Frequently Asked Questions Day of the Dead El Cafecito News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
