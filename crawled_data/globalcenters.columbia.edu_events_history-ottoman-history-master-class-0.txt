4:00 PM Zoom Columbia Global Centers | Istanbul and the Sakıp Sabancı Center for Turkish Studies invite you to a live online master class on the "History of Ottoman History" with Zeynep Çelik, Distinguished Professor of Ottoman and Middle Eastern History and Architecture at New Jersey Institute of Technology and the Federated Department of History at the NJIT and Rutgers-Newark, and A. Tunç Şen, Assistant Professor of History, Columbia University, on August 4 at 5 pm GMT+3. About the Talk This workshop follows up on the seminar taught by Zeynep Çelik and Tunç Şen at Columbia University in fall 2019. The seminar was designed to discuss the formation of the Ottoman-Turkish historiography in the late Ottoman and early Republican Turkey. The main goal was to familiarize the students with the foundational works, trends, institutions, and names of the rigorous and essential scholarship in Ottoman-Turkish studies from a multi-disciplinary approach. The online master class will revisit these issues, and the instructors will share their perspectives and takeaways with the broader online audience. Zeynep Çelik is a distinguished professor of Ottoman and Middle Eastern history and architecture at New Jersey Institute of Technology and the Federated Department of History at the NJIT and Rutgers-Newark. Çelik also teaches history at Columbia University. Her publications include The Remaking of Istanbul (1986—winner of the Institute of Turkish Studies Book Award, 1987), Displaying the Orient (1992), Urban Forms and Colonial Confrontations: Algiers under French Rule (1997), Empire, Architecture, and the City: French-Ottoman Encounters, 1830-1914 (2008—winner of the Society of Architectural Historians Spiro Kostof Book Award, 2010), and About Antiquities: Politics of Archaeology in the Ottoman Empire (2016). Professor Çelik is the recipient of the 2019 Giorgio Levi Della Vida Medal honoring outstanding achievement in Islamic Studies. A. Tunç Şen is an Assistant Professor of History at Columbia University. He is a historian of the Ottoman Empire whose research and records of publication revolve around questions about the history of science and divination, perceptions of time, and manuscript culture in the early modern era. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 2016 with an award-winning dissertation on astrology and astrologers at the early-modern Ottoman court. His first book project, Masters of Time: Astrologers and Scientific Expertise at the Early Modern Ottoman Court, examines the role and corpus of stargazers in measuring, displaying, and interpreting time from chronological datings to the designation of precise auspicious moments. He is one of the collaborators of the international research project, Geographies and Histories of the Ottoman Supernatural Tradition: Exploring Magic, the Marvelous, and the Strange in Ottoman Mentalities funded by the European Research Council and led by Dr. Marinos Sariyannis. He is also sitting on the advisory board for the Manuscripts of the Muslim World project currently undertaken at Columbia University.
