Nearly 1,000 children die everyday due to water related diarrheal diseases. More than 80% of our wastewater is discharged back to the environment without proper treatment. We want to change this. Our mission AguaClara Cornell upholds and protects the fundamental human right to access safe drinking water. We are committed to the ongoing development of resilient, gravity-powered drinking water and wastewater treatment technologies. Students lead the innovation process, learn from each other, and foster a collaborative environment where diversity is celebrated, failures are learning opportunities, and success is shared. We research, invent, and design technologies that are implemented by partner organizations and managed by communities to bring safe water on tap! Our story Â© AguaClara Cornell
