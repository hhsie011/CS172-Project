In partnership with the Providence Public School District, Brown Pre-College Programs seek to increase district student access to rigorous academic and college preparatory opportunities offered through our courses and extra-curricular experiences. If you attend a PPSD school (as listed on this page), you will be eligible to apply for a PPSD Scholarship as soon as you submit your program application. At that time, a link to the scholarship application will become available in the Financial Information tab of your student portal. Although the scholarship application will be available for completion before an admission decision is made, a scholarship decision will only be sent to you if you are admitted to the program. Scholarship information is reviewed confidentially by the scholarship team only and does not influence admission decisions. Scholarships are awarded to students who demonstrate financial need. Need is determined by considering several factors, including family income, family size, number of siblings in college and housing expenses.
