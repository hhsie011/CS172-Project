Areas have included effects on the seismic wavefield by descending slabs and fault zones, solidification of the inner core and its role in driving the geodynamo, viscoelastic and scattering attenuation of waves in heterogeneous media, synthesis of seismic wavefields for nuclear test detection, and seismic detection of mineral phase changes in the upper mantle.
