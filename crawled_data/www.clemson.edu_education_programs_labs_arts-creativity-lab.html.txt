A visual art with seminar space and a performing arts space with a specialized performance floor have been modeled after professional arts studios and designed to create a comfortable and non-intimidating environment for creative work and arts integration in early childhood, elementary and special education. Our Creative Purpose The Arts and Creativity Lab (AC Lab) is a place to nurture creative and artistic thinking. When we feel comfortable and inspired by the aesthetics of our surroundings, we enjoy our work more and can be more open to new ideas. This classroom/lab space was designed by Dr. Alison E. Leonard to allow for concentrated work in both the visual and performing arts in education. The space has been divided into a visual art with seminar space and a performing arts space with a specialized performance floor. Both spaces have been modeled after professional arts spaces and designed to create a comfortable and non-intimidating space for creative work and arts integration in early childhood, elementary, and special education. Dr. Alison E. Leonard, Assistant Professor of Arts and Creativity in Teacher Education, explores arts education, theories of embodiment and learning, and dance in education. Prior to her scholarly work, she danced professionally and taught PK-16 students. Check her out in her former life in the dance pictures below to the right! Many notice that she is always dancing, even at her laptop. In designing the AC Lab, she hopes to inspire educators in the arts and to nurture their creative and artistic capacities. Projects and Research Virtual Environment Interactions A National Science Foundation INSPIRE funded research, Virtual Environment Interactions: Exploring Grounded Embodied Pedagogy in Support of Computational Thinking investigates using embodiment and virtual characters in an interactive virtual environment in order to teach middle-school students computational thinking. The Clemson University research team that includes members of both the College of Education and the School of Computing will design, develop, and evaluate a virtual environment and associated curriculum for blending movement and computer middle school girls with computational thinking. Arts in Education Project This project investigates elementary school student experiences and perceptions of arts in education opportunities during an after-school program. Student knowledge in both arts and non-arts curricular content is being examined. This research asks what impact do arts integration opportunities have on student knowledge? Perceptions on Design and Aesthetics How do students perceive the impact of the aesthetics of a space on their learning/ability to learn? Does space affect students’ perceptions of the arts and their artistic selves? This research examines how design, aesthetics, and student perceptions affect student knowledge and perspectives on learning. Community Arts Organizations and Resources This is a great resource for the arts in the area, especially for EDEL 3100 students looking for arts opportunities, exhibits, and performances. See below for a list of links to a sample of our local and community arts organizations and resources.

From an educator’s perspective, students review the basic foundations of the arts (aesthetics, art criticism, and visual and performing arts) and explore the arts’ role in education, their connection to other disciplines, and their unique contribution to human societies. Through lessons involving embodied arts experiences, ‘body-on’ arts making, curriculum design, the application of digital media, group activities, and class readings and discussions, students develop artistic and aesthetic skills that will help them to confidently speak about and utilize the arts, creativity, and design as ways of thinking, inquiry, expression, and assessment with their future students. In EDEL 3100, students create and participate in 2D art projects, a found art sculpture social media project, digital storytelling movies, drama tableaus, movement workshops, arts critiques, and playful creative exploration. We found it, created art, and now you’ve…FOUND ART! For example, for the Found Art Sculpture Project, students use everyday objects to create unique sculptures. Once completed, the sculptures are placed in public places to be found by anyone who encounters them. From there, they can be kept or altered and replaced in a public place. Look out for our sculptures! Each has a tag similar to the one on the right. If found, we ask that you email us and tell us about your experience of finding art at clemsonfoundart@gmail.com College of Education "Best In Class" Copyright © Clemson University College of Education "Best In Class" | 101 Gantt Circle 864-656-7656 | Email Us | Website Updates intro-arrow Engage With Us Through Facebook Twitter Instagram Clemson University Facebook Instagram Twitter Linkedin Youtube Tiktok Policy/Terms of Use Web Accessibility Ethics/Safety Hotline Privacy Policy Copyright © 2022 Clemson University • Clemson, South Carolina 29634 Clemson University Facebook Instagram Twitter Linkedin Youtube Tiktok Resources A-Z Index Campus Map CU Safety Directory Webcams Apply to Clemson
