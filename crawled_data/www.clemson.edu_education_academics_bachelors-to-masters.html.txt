Overview The MAT in Teacher Residency in either Early Childhood Education, Elementary Education, Middle Level Education, Modern Languages Education, Secondary Education, or Special Education is a 30-credit program that can be completed in three semesters. It consists of a mix of face-to-face and hybrid courses along with a rich, immersive, year-long field experience component. Current undergraduate students who are studying P-12 educational fields such as early childhood, elementary, middle level, secondary (English, history, science or mathematics), modern language (French, Spanish, and American Sign Language) and special education teacher preparation programs are the target participants for the Teacher Residency Program. The curriculum plan is based on the combined bachelors to masters combined program philosophy, in such, that qualified students will take 12 hours of graduate coursework their senior year in place of a traditional student teaching experience (9 hours) and capstone seminar (3 hours). Students are expected to graduate from their undergraduate program as planned (May or August, senior year). During the 5th year, students will complete the remaining hours toward their MAT degree. Students will be recommended for initial teaching certification after successfully completing their graduate teacher residency field experience. Admissions Requirements To enter into the combined program, students must have a minimum overall GPA of 3.0 and a minimum of 90 credits. Students in the combined degree program are conditionally accepted to the graduate program until completion of the BA/BS degree requirements and also bypass the application fees and GRE/MAT testing requirement. According to Clemson University’s policy on Combined Bachelor’s/Master’s Plan, the student must complete a total of 150 credit hours between the two degree programs. Students will be advised of the requirement and, if necessary, additional coursework may be required. Program Requirements During the fall of their senior year, students will meet with an academic advisor to complete the final paperwork necessary to transition into the teacher residency program. Students will complete the GS6 Bachelor-to-Graduate from, complete the change of major form indicating they will move into the non-certification concentration area of their undergraduate degree, and check previous forms (application and intent forms) for accuracy. At the time of advising, students must have a minimum GPA of 3.4 and a minimum of 90 credits to enter the program and register for spring graduate courses. Therefore, students must meet these benchmarks by the end of summer following their junior year. Students must complete a total of 150 credit hours between the two degree programs (BA/BS and MAT). Therefore, to complete the program as we have planned, students should have 120 hours by the end of fall, senior year and 132 hours by the end of spring, senior year. During the spring of their senior year, students will take 12 hours of graduate coursework in education. Courses will be held on main campus and follow Clemson’s academic calendar. Students must maintain a minimum GPA of 3.0 in their MAT/graduate coursework. In conjunction with the coursework, students will be placed in a clinical field placement with a minimum of 2 days in the placement required. Students will also need to take and pass PRAXIS II (PLT and subject assessment) prior to beginning the fall residency internship. Students will not meet the S.C. Department of Education requirement for initial teacher certification through their undergraduate program and will not be recommended for initial teacher certification by the Clemson University College of Education until they have completed their graduate teacher residency field experience. Spring - Senior year of student’s BA/BS program: ED 8250 – Cultural Diversity in Education (3 hrs) ED 8400/8401 – Classroom Learning Environments (3 hrs) ED 8650 – Curriculum Theory (3 hrs) ED 8600 – Classroom-based Research (3 hrs) Other Program Activities – Teacher Residency Kickoff Meeting and 1-2 workshops with assigned master teacher Please note: If you have any unfinished course requirements in your undergraduate program, other than the 12-hours of student teaching and capstone seminar, you must register for and successfully complete these unfinished courses to be awarded your undergraduate degree. With completion of undergraduate requirements, undergraduate degree should be awarded in May or August, senior year to continue with program. The remaining 18 hours of graduate coursework during the 5th year has three primary components: 1) residency experience, 2) residency seminars, and 3) research classes. The residency experience involves interactions between students, master teachers, university supervisors, and school leaders. Residency experiences start in the fall when the master teachers with whom the resident is placed return to school for teacher workdays. The seminars focus on course assignments, reflection, and readings to support growth during the fall and spring. Finally, all students will engage in two research classes (one fall, one spring) that will culminate in an independent research study focusing on teacher effectiveness. Courses during the residency year will be offered at the University Center in Greenville. 5th Year-First semester MAT Teacher Residency Program: EDF 8080 – Contemporary Issues in Assessment (3 hrs) ED 8090 – Teacher Residency Internship (3 hrs) ED 8480 – Teacher Residency Seminar (3 hrs) 5th Year-Second semester MAT Teacher Residency Program: ED 8990 – Capstone Project (3 hrs) ED 8090 – Teacher Residency Internship (3 hrs) ED 8480 –Teacher Residency Seminar (3 hrs) Tentative Timeline Information Sessions: January, junior year Application Released: January, junior year Application and Recommendations Due: March, junior year Faculty Review Completed: March, junior year District Review Completed: April, junior year Notification of Conditional Acceptance Status: April, junior year Meetings to Sign Intent Forms: April, junior year Meet with Advisors to Complete Remaining Paperwork: October or November, senior year Begin Graduate Coursework: January, senior year Financial Aid and Teacher Residency Fellowships Graduate assistantships are not available for this program.
