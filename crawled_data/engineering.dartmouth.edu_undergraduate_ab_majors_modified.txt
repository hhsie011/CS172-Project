 |  Engineering Sciences / Modified Modified Engineering Sciences Major Students can create a cross-disciplinary modified engineering sciences major by taking six courses in engineering and four courses in the modifying area plus the necessary prerequisites and culminating experience. On This Page Program Options Degree Planning Student Spotlight Alumni Spotlight Request Info Visit Apply Program Options Dartmouth engineers are professionals in all corners of industry. We have graduates in: Architecture Biotechnology Chemical engineering Computer engineering Environmental engineering Geotechnical engineering Management and finance Neural engineering Product design Technology in public policy Preparation for these fields can be obtained through the Engineering Sciences Major or one of our pre-approved modified majors as engineering with: Biology (biotechnology) Learn More Chemistry (chemical engineering) Learn More Computer Science (computer engineering) Learn More Earth Sciences (geotechnical engineering) Learn More Economics (management and finance) Learn More Environmental Sciences (environmental engineering) Learn More Neuroscience (neural engineering) Learn More Public Policy (technology in public policy) Learn More Studio Art (architecture / product design) Learn More Degree Planning Plans for a modified major should be prepared in consultation with Professor Doug Van Citters and must be approved in writing by him and filed with the registrar. Students interested in creating a modified major different from the ones listed above should consult with Professor Doug Van Citters. A coherent program of study with substantial engineering sciences content, with the written approval of the chair, must be filed with the registrar. Students interested in combining engineering and physics should pursue the Engineering Physics Major. Students interested in focusing on materials science should pursue the Materials Science Minor, which combines engineering with chemistry and physics. Students interested in biomedical engineering should pursue the Biomedical Engineering Sciences Major. Student Spotlight I'm an Engineer and an Environmental Scientist Andrew Wong '12 discusses his focus in engineering, environmental studies, and international studies at Dartmouth. Alumni Spotlight Founder and CEO of Nearburg Producing Company Charles Nearburg '72, Th'74, discusses how combining majors prepares engineers for success. 15 Thayer Drive, Hanover, NH 03755 +1 (603) 646-2230 Undergraduate Graduate Research Entrepreneurship Community About ThayerExpress Faculty Offices Visit Apply Give Facebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn YouTube Flickr © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • A-Z Index • Privacy • Feedback
