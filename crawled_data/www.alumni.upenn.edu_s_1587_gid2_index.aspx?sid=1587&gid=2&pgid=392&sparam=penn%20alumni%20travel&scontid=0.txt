Our trips provide a rich travel experience thanks to their educational character, unique access to special lectures with Penn faculty, and the camaraderie of like-minded intellectually curious travelers. We invite our alumni and the entire Penn family to join us as we celebrate the University’s traditions and values through our alumni travel program. COVID-19 Update: In Fall 2021 we resumed travel slowly and safely with a modified schedule. We will continue to ease into travel with a shorter 2022 schedule, and we look forward to welcoming our alumni and friends when they feel ready to travel once again! Please note that, while we intend to send a faculty host on all 2022 departures, disruptions due to University travel policy or host schedules may occur. In the meantime, we invite you to stay connected with us on social media (Instagram: @PennAlumniTravel or Facebook) and through upcoming virtual events, including our new free, virtual Global Discovery Series featuring Penn Alumni Travel faculty hosts.
