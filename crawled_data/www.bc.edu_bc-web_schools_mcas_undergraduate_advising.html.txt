It's our mission to direct students’ scholarly pursuits to lead meaningful and purposeful lives. Rooted in the Catholic Intellectual Tradition, the AAC is an essential resource to navigate and develop the cerebral, spiritual, and civil responsibilities of our community. Appreciating and honoring the diversity of Boston College, we equip students to be academically prepared while attentive to the universal call of responsible care for creation and solidarity with those on the margins. Focused on the Jesuit ideal of eloquentia perfecta, we work to enhance the University’s care and cultivation of the whole person: encouraging the development of articulate, critical, and socially-minded persons. The AAC (along with over 150 faculty advisors) coordinates several critical programs and initiatives for the Dean of the College. From summer orientation to commencement, we guide the academic pursuits of our students. The Pre-Health Program is a crucial part of the AAC as well as the Class Deans of Morrissey College. We are the academic matchmakers facilitating our students’ scholarly way of proceeding.
