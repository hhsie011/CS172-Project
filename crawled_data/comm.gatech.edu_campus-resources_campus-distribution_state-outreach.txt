It is this local impact that we aim to amplify through an ongoing cross-unit campaign. Focused on education, innovation, and the economy, we will use broad storytelling and digital and graphic elements, housed in a dynamic portal titled Our State, to proactively illustrate the Institute’s commitment to its local roots. Specifically, we will use the content to: Increase awareness of Tech’s impact on the state Build and retain relationships at the state capitol Expand Tech’s brand and reputation Demonstrate and promote examples of impact By collaborating across multiple units of the Institute, we will amplify stories about statewide impact for lawmakers, business and community leaders, students, faculty, staff, alumni, affiliates, and the general public.
