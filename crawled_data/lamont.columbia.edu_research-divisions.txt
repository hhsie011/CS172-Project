Since its founding in 1949, Lamont has been a leader in the Earth sciences, and is now the scientific research heart of the Columbia Climate School founded in 2020. We are a dynamic community of 500 scientists, students, and staff, with nearly 300 PhD-level researchers, and 80-90 graduate students involved in research. Our scientists study the planet from its deepest interior to the outer reaches of its atmosphere, on every continent and in every ocean, providing a rational basis for the difficult choices facing humanity. Research Themes Research Divisions Biology and Paleo Environment Biology and Paleo Environment is a diverse group of oceanographers, geologists, geochemists, biologists, and environmental scientists who use biology to uncover clues about Earth’s past and study how the modern environment affects biology through its oceans, atmosphere, and land. Geochemistry Using advanced chemical and isotope analyses of air, water, biological remains, rocks, and meteorites, Geochemistry researchers seek to understand Earth’s environments by studying its history and the past and present processes that have governed these environments. Marine Geology & Geophysics Marine Geology & Geophysics scientists are explorers at heart, motivated by curiosity to understand some of the most remote and forbidding parts of our planet, from the active margins beneath the oceans to the polar ice sheets. Marine/Large Programs From expeditions aboard the R/V Marcus G. Langseth to seafloor mapping to ship-based experiences for students and more, Marine/Large Programs marine geoscientists and experts are seafaring explorers of Earth's history and environment. Ocean & Climate Physics Researchers in Ocean & Climate Physics study Earth's climate dynamics from sea ice to the oceans to the atmosphere in order to document change, build an understanding of controlling forces, and develop cutting-edge computer models for crucial predictions. Seismology, Geology & Tectonophysics Seismology, Geology & Tectonophysic scientists are at the forefront of seismology, solid earth dynamics, rock mechanics, and sedimentary geology, making important contributions to the study of earthquakes, Earth’s structure, and motions and deformation of tectonic plates.
