The program offers support in developing the skills and gaining the knowledge students need to lead with care and intention. It will offer space for students to reflect on their sense of purpose and what drives them to do this work. This is also an opportunity to build community with other students who are looking to grow as leaders in order to have an impact on the student experience at Brown. Students in our Spring 2022 pilot program will engage in a community of learning and practice with recurring discussions, workshops, and gatherings. These sessions will support students in learning to: foster capacity for empathy; develop critical consciousness; center equity and justice in purpose and practice; navigate conflict from a place of care; engage in an ongoing exploration of self; lead from where you are; cultivate interdependence, connection and community; build shared values; and to have an impact. Each cohort will be made up of ~15 students. As a member of the JUST Lead Educational Program, students take part in eight weekly sessions and have the opportunity to take part in additional opt-in workshops. There will also be some pre-work outside of weekly sessions. Given the pilot status of the program, participants will also be asked to give feedback on the sessions and play an active role in the evaluation process.
