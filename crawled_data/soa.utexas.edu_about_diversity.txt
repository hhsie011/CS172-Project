The necessity for creating an inclusive community on college campuses is supported by several national education association reports, which suggest that in order to create a vital community of learning, the academy must create an environment that cultivates diversity and celebrates difference. The University of Texas at Austin School of Architecture is committed to creating a workplace in which all faculty, staff, and students are valued for their contributions to accomplishing the School's mission. We strive to create an equitable and inclusive environment for all people regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, gender identity, gender expression, sex, sexual orientation, age, level of physical ability, citizenship status, or socioeconomic status. "Underpinning all that we do at the School of Architecture is a deep commitment to diversity. It guides who we are, what we teach and research, and how we change our disciplines," said Dean Michelle Addington. "Our commitment to diversity goes beyond ensuring that there is equitable participation from under-represented populations; it enables us to open up new avenues of discourse and explore unprecedented opportunities as we bring more voices, more experiences, and more knowledge to bear." -Read the School's Framework for Diversity here. Committee for Diversity + Equity (CODE) In 2008, Dean Fritz Steiner commissioned a Diversity Task Force with the charge of gathering feedback from students, faculty, and staff, presenting a report of its findings, and drafting a strategic plan (Framework for Diversity) for addressing diversity and equity within the School. After successes and some missed opportunities, Committee on Diversity + Equity [CODE], a school-wide committee, was formed in 2015 as an ongoing commitment to achieving greater diversity and equity within each program and the School as a whole. Speaker Series The School of Architecture’s Committee on Diversity and Equity approved at the end of the 2020-2021 school year a proposal to fund and support a series of equity focused events. The series, run by PSO and GSARC representatives, will help us students discuss, learn, and reflect on the ways in which racial injustice has manifested itself in the built environment and practitioners have confronted these truths through their personal and professional lives. We, the students in the School of Architecture, believe it is our responsibility as future practitioners to educate ourselves on how to create, promote, and participate in truly equitable communities. Our first event is coming up on November 15 and we really hope you will join us. 2020-21 CODE Members: Co-chairs: Fernando Lara and Charlton Lewis Heather Corcoran Dominic Deniro Tara Dudley Carolina English Margaret Gallagher Christine Garner Maggie Hansen James Hardt Caitlin Hartnett Junfeng Jiao Yuhana Khan Audrey Matthews Jasmin Blas-Mendieta Adam Miller Temi Osanyintolu Bob Paterson Anagisel Toscano Ramos Kait Reynolds Estrella Sainburg Abby Simpson Miriam Solis Larry Speck August Stanley Kelsey Stine Leora Visotzky Wilfred Wang Sarah Wu School Resources: CRPSO Community and Regional Planning Student Organization Feminist Design Collective (FDC) NOMAS National Organization of Minority Architecture Students International Students University Resources Services for Students with Disabilities International Student Office Division of Diversity & Community Engagement Campus Climate Response Team Multicultural Engagement Center Gender and Sexuality Center Exhibition image.jpg UTSOA Committee on Diversity + Equity, Statement of Support 6.4.20 DesignFutures_workshop Design Futures 2020 5.18.20 1215_N290_Iwan Baan.jpg Michael Murphy: "Justice is Beauty" 3.4.19 About Mission & Vision Dean's Message Diversity SOAvoices Race & Gender in the Built Environment Fellows Support & Donate Faculty Students Alumni Staff Contacts Quicklinks The University of Texas at Austin School of Architecture 310 Inner Campus Drive B7500 Austin, TX 78712-1009 512.471.1922 UT Privacy UT Web Accessibility Get Adobe Acrobat
