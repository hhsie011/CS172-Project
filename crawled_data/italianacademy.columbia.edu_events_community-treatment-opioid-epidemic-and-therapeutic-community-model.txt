Medication-assisted treatment and short-term rehabilitation are common treatment options for individuals with opioid use disorder, especially in the United States, but do not meet the needs of all individuals. The therapeutic community (TC) model offers a unique treatment frame to address individuals with opioid use disorder, and may at times be preferred by patients over current first-line interventions. This conference will explore the evidence supporting different treatment options for opioid use disorder around the world, highlighting the TC modality as uniquely effective and using a current European model—San Patrignano, the largest TC in the world—to identify salient mediators of outcome.
