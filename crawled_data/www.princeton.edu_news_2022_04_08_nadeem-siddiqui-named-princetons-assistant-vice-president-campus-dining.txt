His experience also includes leading dining teams at Texas A&M, Stanford University, Cornell University, Washington University in St. Louis, and the University of Chicago. Siddiqui graduated with a bachelor of arts from Punjab University and holds a bachelor of science in hotel and motel restaurant management from Moorhead State University.
