Our process is not necessarily a linear one, as steps can vary in sequence and often occur simultaneously. Early contact with our office starts with a phone call, email, or by completing a Share Your Idea form. Together with you, our case managers will evaluate your idea, conduct patent searches if applicable, and analyze the market and competition to determine its commercialization potential. The evaluation process will guide our strategic assessment on the best path forward, and together we will determine whether to focus on licensing your idea or innovation to an existing company, or creating a new company. You may even wish to build a working prototype of your idea in the Makerspace + Microfactory. 1819 Innovation Hub 2900 Reading Rd Cincinnati, OH 45206 513-556-5511 UC Tools Canopy & Canvas One Stop Email Catalyst Shuttle Tracker IT Help UC VPN Bearcats Landing About Us Maps & Directions Jobs News Diversity Governance & Policies Directory Events Calendar University of Cincinnati | 2600 Clifton Ave. | Cincinnati, OH 45221 | ph: 513-556-6000 Alerts | Clery and HEOA Notice | Notice of Non-Discrimination | eAccessibility Concern | Privacy Statement | Copyright Information © 2020 University of Cincinnati 1819 Innovation Hub 2900 Reading Rd Cincinnati, OH 45206 513-556-5511 © 2020 University of Cincinnati scroll up to the top
