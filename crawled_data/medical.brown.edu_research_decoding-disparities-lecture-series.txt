The series took place during the fall semester of 2020. The series is supported by The Paul Levinger Professorship Pro Tem in the Economics of Health Care. This lecture was established in 1987 to honor the memory of Paul Levinger by a gift from his wife, Ruth N. Levinger, on behalf of the Levinger family. The Levingers' daughter and son-in-law, Bette Levinger Cohen and John M. Cohen '59, MD were instrumental in Mrs. Levinger's decision to make this gift.
