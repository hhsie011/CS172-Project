Chan School of Public Health. While the program is interdisciplinary in nature, students specialize in one of five concentrations: decision sciences, economics, management, methods for policy research, or political analysis. Approximately 110 faculty members from schools within the University are involved with the program, and students are free to take classes throughout the University. A hallmark of the program is the accessibility of faculty members to students and the commitment of faculty to students enrolled in the program. The program started in 1992, and there are 67 students currently enrolled and over 240 alumni.
