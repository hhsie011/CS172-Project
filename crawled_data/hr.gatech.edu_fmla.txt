The employee must be employed for at least one year and have worked at least 1,250 hours during the previous 12 months. FMLA Process Summary Overview Requesting FMLA Leave Employees requesting FMLA must submit an Extended Absence Request through the Employee Self Service portal in OneUSG Connect and provide the appropriate FMLA Certification form, if applicable, to GTHR Benefits. If an employee with a qualifying reason for FMLA does not initiate a request for FMLA, GTHR Benefits will send FMLA paperwork to the employee after the third full day of consecutive absence. The employee must return the certification form to GTHR Benefits within 15 calendar days. Notice of Eligibility After a request for FMLA has been received by GTHR Benefits, the employee will receive a Notice of Eligibility and Rights & Responsibilities Notice from GTHR Benefits advising them if they are eligible or not eligible for FMLA. This notice is emailed to the employee’s work email (or personal email given by the employee) within 5 business days of their request for FMLA leave. Review of Medical Certifications & Supporting Documents Employee must complete and return all required paperwork to the GTHR Benefits Leave Specialist assigned to them within 7 calendar days after being notified of any deficiencies in the required documentation. Designation Notice GTHR Benefits will issue a Designation Notice to employees that are eligible for FMLA within 5 business days which indicates the time they are taking is designated as FMLA and specifies the number of weeks, days, or hours (in the case of intermittent leave) that will be counted against their FMLA leave entitlement. Records GTHR Benefits will maintain FMLA paperwork in a file (separate from employee’s personnel file) for no less than three years. Leave Tracking FMLA leave is automatically tracked in the applicable, Absence System. Employees and supervisors should monitor the time keeping records for employees on leave to make sure that absences are reported correctly. GTHR Benefits should be made aware of information that is not reported correctly.

Employees Responsibilities Employees must notify their supervisor (or HR Representative) that they will need to take leave. Employees must enter their request for leave in the Employee Self Service (ESS) Portal and ensure that requested FMLA Certification Forms (if applicable) and other medical documents are returned to GTHR Benefits. Failure to provide the necessary requested documentation to GTHR Benefits may result in a delay in approval of FMLA leave. While on FMLA leave employees should periodically check in with their supervisor or HR Representative regarding their status and intent to return to work. Supervisor Responsibilities Should notify GTHR Benefits when they become aware that an employee may need FMLA, or when an employee has been absent 3 or more days due to illness or injury. Confirm that the employee has submitted their request for leave through the Employee Self Service (ESS) portal in OneUSG Connect. Supervisors (or HR Representative) should also notify GTHR when an employee has returned from leave. Additional Resources The below is a list of frequently asked questions about the FMLA.
