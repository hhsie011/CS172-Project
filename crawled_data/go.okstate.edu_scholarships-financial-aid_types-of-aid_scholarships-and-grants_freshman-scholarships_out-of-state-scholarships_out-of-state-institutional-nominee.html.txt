We offer a very competitive scholarship package to these students, known as Institutional Nominees. All freshmen who apply for admissions/scholarships at OSU, and who are nominated by OSU are guaranteed the following cash and tuition scholarships for 2022-2023 once they are confirmed as Academic Scholars by OSRHE. The minimum criteria to be considered for an Institutional Nominee scholarship require either (1) at least a 32 ACT composite score (or 1420 SAT) on a national test, AND a 3.5 unweighted high school GPA; or (2) at least a 3.9 unweighted high school GPA AND top 2 percent ranking in your high school graduating class or rank of #1 or #2; or (3) at least a 3.9 unweighted high school GPA AND at least a 30 ACT composite score (or 1360 SAT). OSU recipients tend to be students who applied early, have at least a 33 ACT and a 3.9 GPA. Official ACT Superscores provided by ACT will be accepted for Institutional Nominee scholarship consideration. At OSU there is no secondary nomination step after being admitted.
