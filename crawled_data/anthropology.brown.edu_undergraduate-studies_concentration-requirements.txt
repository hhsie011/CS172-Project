Archaeological fieldwork, Chiapas, Mexico. Students concentrating in Anthropology must declare one of the six concentration tracks. All tracks require at least nine courses in anthropology. At least five of the nine courses counted toward the concentration must be 1000-level or higher. Seniors may be permitted to enroll in graduate seminars (2000-level courses) with the permission of the instructor. Students also have the opportunity to work independently for concentration credit by taking an independent reading and research course in anthropology (ANTH1970). Independent reading and research courses can be taken a maximum of two times. Courses in anthropology are defined as (1) having the ANTH prefix, (2) listed in the ANTH XLIST on Courses @ Brown, or (3) taught by an anthropologist in another department and containing significant content in anthropological thought, theory, and methodology. For (3), please consult with the DUS to determine if the course can be applied towards the concentration. Concentrators should select their courses in Anthropology in consultation with their concentration advisor. All Anthropology tracks are compatible with the Engaged Scholars Program. Current Anthropology courses Double Concentrating Students that concentrate in both Anthropology and another discipline may count no more than two courses towards both concentrations.

Photo by Patricia E. Rubertone. As a capstone experience in anthropology, all students will take the Senior Seminar - (Re)Making Anthropology (ANTH 1990). The Senior Seminar is the ninth required course in all Anthropology Tracks. The Seminar brings all seniors together to reflect on the past, present, and future of anthropology and to consider how their particular education and research experiences fit within the broader arc of the discipline. Students interested in expanding their capstone experience may complete a voluntary Honors or Senior Thesis project, in addition to the Senior Seminar. Students participating in the Engaged Scholars Program should review the requirements for the ESP capstone experience.
