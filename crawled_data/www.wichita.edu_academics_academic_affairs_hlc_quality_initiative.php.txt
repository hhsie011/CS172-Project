Usually a Quality Initiative is designed to begin and be completed during a designated time-frame or it may be one that continues an initiative already in progress or achieve a key milestone in the work of a longer initiative. The Quality Initiative is intended to allow institutions to take risks, aim high, and if so be it, learn from only partial success or even failure. The Graduation Partnership, an ongoing campus initiative, has been selected as WSU's Quality Initiative. Data is collected by the Offices of Assessment and Planning Analysis on an ongoing basis throughout the academic year and reported in a dashboard format. It is reviewed by the Retention Council. Reports are issued annually that document changes and improvements. The Retention Council is made-up of representatives from all areas of the university including administrators, faculty, and staff.
