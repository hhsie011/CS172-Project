Many come with undergraduate degrees such as architecture, mythology, creative writing, computer science, fine arts, history, psychology... even music! Combined, this diversity provides a broad perspective that inspires creative concepts and designs to appeal to a variety of gamers. Courses in English, creative writing, programming, psychology, and technical art are helpful in preparing for our Level Design track. Familiarity with level modification using free game editors and programming languages like C# and LUA is valuable. Designers need to be able to communicate well both verbally and in writing, so pursue courses that enhance those skills. In addition, artistic skills of any sort are useful, particularly experience with digital art creation tools like Photoshop, 3DStudio Max or Maya.
