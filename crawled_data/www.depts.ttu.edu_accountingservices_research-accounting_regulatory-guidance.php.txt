The FDP is a collaborative organization between certain federal organizations and institutes of higher education to work together to decrease administrative burden. The FDP has organized responses to federal regulation changes, developed uniform templates for member institutions for award documents to promote uniformity, and piloted programs to test effects of burdens among other things. Federal agencies who participate in the FDP make efforts to uniformly apply federal regulations. For example, federal guidance often requires prior approval for various revisions, purchases, or administrative changes to awards. These federal agencies work together to waive many of these requirements across the board to collectively assist in reducing administrative burden on their agencies and institutions of higher education. For information on the FDP or a listing of participating agencies and institutions, please visit http://sites.nationalacademies.org/pga/fdp/index.htm.
