These measures overhauled cities' mobility cultures, limiting human movement to a distance of 15 minutes from one's home. The creation of a ‘city of villages’ is gaining momentum around the world, shaping future designs of cityscapes in a post-pandemic world. This webinar addresses how the pandemic reintroduces Carlos Moreno’s notion of “la ville du quart d’heure” in which daily urban necessities are within a 15-minute reach on foot or by bike. It brings together experts to discuss how the urban environment is being repurposed as well as the subsequent impact on community, creativity and city life. Panelists will also investigate commuters’ reaction to emergencies and pandemics by exposing changes in people’s behaviour when living in 15 minutes’ cities.
