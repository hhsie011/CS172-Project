This tool allows you to build lists of content for a class, including materials that the library owns or subscribes to as well as other content that you may want to include. Leganto is accessed from within your Canvas course by selecting Library Reserves/Guides SU22 from the left navigation. Or login directly to the Library Reserves tool, https://dcl.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/login?auth=SAML. Please see the Library Guide for how to use the new Library Reserves tool. https://researchguides.dartmouth.edu/coursereserves For media reserve requests, please send Jones Media Center a completed Excel form found on the Jones Media Center webpage https://www.dartmouth.edu/library/mediactr/reserves.html.
