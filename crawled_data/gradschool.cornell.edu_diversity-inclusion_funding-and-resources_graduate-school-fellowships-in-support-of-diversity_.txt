They are available on a competitive basis to nominated students applying for Fall admission who are U.S. citizens, U.S. permanent residents, or students holding DACA, TPS, refugee, or asylee status. Students who wish to be considered for these fellowships must submit a supplemental personal statement with their application materials, if a personal statement is not already required as part of the application for their graduate field. Students awarded a fellowship in support of diversity will be recognized as Graduate School Dean’s Scholars and will be invited to participate in community and professional activities sponsored by the Office of Inclusion and Student Engagement and its partners. Students awarded a fellowship may receive a standard offer of admission and subsequently be offered this competitive fellowship in lieu of a standard funding offer. Through the personal statement, students are asked to address how their personal background and experiences influenced their decision to pursue a graduate degree. Additionally, students are asked to provide insight on their potential to contribute to a community of inclusion, belonging, and respect where scholars representing diverse backgrounds, perspectives, abilities, and experiences can learn and work productively and positively together. For consideration for nomination for a Graduate School Diversity Fellowship, students must also use the personal statement to indicate how one or more of the following identities and/or experiences apply to them: First-generation college graduate (neither parent/guardian having completed a baccalaureate degree) Member of ethnic and/or racial groups historically excluded from and underrepresented in graduate education – Black, Indigenous (Native American, Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian, Native Pacific Islanders, other Indigenous peoples), Hispanic/Latina/o/x, and/or Southeast Asian McNair or Mellon Mays Undergraduate Scholar (the Graduate School will verify an applicant’s status as a McNair Scholar or Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellow while pursuing a baccalaureate degree at a U.S. institution) Other identities and/or experiences historically underrepresented and/or marginalized within graduate education including but not limited to the following: Those who manage a disability Having a gender and/or sexual orientation identity historically underrepresented in your field of study Those who identify as a military veteran Holding DACA, TPS, refugee, or asylee status Those who have experienced housing and/or food insecurity Single parents How to apply: Prospective students apply for diversity fellowships through the Graduate School admissions application. To be considered for nomination for a diversity fellowship, eligible applicants must respond “yes” to the question on the admissions application asking whether they would be interested in being considered for a diversity fellowship. Applicants must also submit a supplemental personal statement (if a personal statement is not already required by their graduate field) that addresses the provided statement prompt and how the above criteria apply to them. The director of graduate studies for the graduate field to which the applicant is applying must submit a letter of nomination and a mentoring plan to the Graduate School for consideration by the associate dean for inclusion & student engagement and the dean of the Graduate School.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
