It is used to fund those instructional costs the state pays on behalf of qualifying Ohio residents. The term "Ohio resident" for tuition purposes may differ from other definitions of Ohio residency. Initially, the Office of the Registrar determines a students residency status with the information provided on a students admissions application. Some residents of Indiana and Kentucky are eligible for Ohio-resident tuition rates (reciprocity) or a discounted Metropolitan surcharge based on their program enrollment, county of residence and application approval.
