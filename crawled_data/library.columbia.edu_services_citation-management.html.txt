Zotero Zotero allows you to collect, organize, cite and share your research sources and enables the download, capture, and indexing of full text from PDFs and websites. The Libraries recommend the use of Zotero due to its open-source pedigree and widespread popularity. Zotero is available as a Firefox plugin as well as a standalone version, providing browser extensions for Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. Zotero's integration with Firefox is considerably more efficient than with the other browsers, however, so bear this in mind when getting started. Click here for a free download of Zotero. Consult the Quick Start Guide for tips and videos on how to get started using Zotero. Be sure to download a word processor plugin to make the fullest use of this software. The Libraries offer free hands-on workshops on using Zotero. You can find information about dates and times as well as register online to attend one of these sessions on the Libraries Workshops page. Using Zotero to Maintain Integrity in your Online Sources: &nbsp; Additional Citation Management Tools Mendeley: Mendeley is another free standalone application, which performs largely the same functions as Zotero but behaves a little bit differently. For example, while both Zotero and Mendeley allow you to extract metadata (such as title, authors, etc.) from PDFs, Mendeley automates this process while providing the option of organizing your files directly in your hard drive in a customizable manner. Mendeley also allows for highlighting and annotations directly on the article PDF. Download Mendeley here. Here is a list of Mendeley Help Guides to get you started, or to expand your knowledge. EndNote: NOTE TO WINDOWS USERS The license.dat file needs to be in the same location as the installation file in order for the registration to work (e.g. if you downloaded the installation file to your Downloads folder, the license.dat file needs to be there as well).

Zotero provides instructions on how to import reference libraries from other software you may have used in the past. If you are a Mendeley user, here are instructions on importing reference libraries from EndNote, from Zotero, or from Papers.
