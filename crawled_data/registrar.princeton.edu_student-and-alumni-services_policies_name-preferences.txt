If you need help using these services, please contact the OIT Help Desk at 258-4357 (258-HELP). Preferred Name Designating a preferred first name does not alter your legal name in University records or elsewhere; it simply indicates the name that you would like the community to use when addressing you: On class and advising rosters In University directories and communications In most University information systems We encourage you to review the policy before adding a preferred name. Instructions Log in to TigerHub. Select the TigerHub/Personal Information tile. Select Add/Update Preferred Name. Then let the system guide you through the process. Preferred Name Policy Princeton recognizes that many students prefer to use first names other than their legal ones to identify themselves. As long as the use of this preferred name is not for the purposes of misrepresentation, the University acknowledges that a “preferred name” can and should be used where possible in the course of University business and education. Therefore, any student may choose to identify a preferred first name in addition to their legal name. The student’s preferred name will be used in the university directory, in many communications, on class rosters, and in reporting, except where the use of the legal name is required. For example, some records, such as paychecks, require use of a legal name; in such circumstances, the University will not be able to use the preferred name. However, whenever reasonably possible, “preferred name” will be used. Inappropriate use of the preferred name, including but not limited to misrepresentation or attempting to avoid a legal obligation, may be cause for denying the request. NameCoach To help us to pronounce your name correctly, we offer NameCoach, a software service that enables you to record its pronunciation and indicate a phonetic spelling. Instructions Log in to TigerHub. Select the TigerHub/Personal Information tile. Select “Record Your Name.” (Be sure that your pop-up blocker is disabled.) Follow the prompts. You will receive an automated call, during which you may confirm your recording. Graduate students may also access NameCoach from the Advanced Degree Application. How does it work? Your voice recording and phonetic spelling are made available to advisers, instructors, and administrative staff. Faculty and administrative staff access your recorded name from advisee and class rosters and other PeopleSoft Student Records pages.
