Other statutory functions of the Board include the appointment of faculty and principal administrative officers, the purchase and disposition of real property, the establishment of salary scales, and the awarding of degrees. In short, the Board of Trustees has ultimate responsibility for the financial, administrative and academic affairs of the College. Presidential Search The Board of Trustees is launching a search for a successor to President Philip J. Hanlon ’77, who has announced his intention to step down in June 2023. Dartmouth has had only 18 presidents since its founding in 1769, underscoring the importance of this process. We have designed our search to ensure that key stakeholders—faculty, students, staff, and alumni—have the opportunity to engage. This will help us to identify the most important qualities and strengths in our future president and build a robust and diverse candidate pool. You may share your suggestions and any nominations with the committee at presidential.search@dartmouth.edu.
