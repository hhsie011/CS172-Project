It aspires to develop engaged citizens and leaders, in the TTU community, in the region, and in the world who serve as engaged representatives for social change. When & Where: TBD About the Tunnel The Tunnel is a campus grassroots diversity program that originated in 1993 at the Western Illinois University. Using the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles, California as a model, the Tunnel strives to give people a way to experience oppression in a hands-on way. By engaging the emotions of the participants, it allows for the accounts expressed in the program to be truly effective. People may have never been placed in these types of situations, and they obtain a sense of what it may feel like to experience discrimination or oppression. While the Tunnel may evoke strong emotions, it can be an effective tool used to teach people about how it really feels to be in the various situations. After the incredible response and positive feedback we received after the last several years, the Tunnel has now become an annual event. Tour the Tunnel Participants are guided through a series of exhibits that are designed to introduce participants to concepts around identities, power, privilege and diversity. Also guide participants through ways to think more deeply about a variety of topics regarding social justice concepts. We encourage participants to experience the tunnel as a group, whether it be a class or student organization. Individual participation is also highly encouraged! Tunnel of Awareness is made possible in part by the efforts and passions of volunteers from various student orgs, TTU departments, and community members.
