If you completed the Honors College Decision Form to confirm your acceptance to the Honors College (or if you were listed as a Great Texts major) by 3/1 or 4/1 you were considered for scholarships. If you have not received an email and the scholarship has not been posted to your account, unfortunately, this means that after careful review of your application, we are not able to extend a scholarship offer at this time. We thank you very much for your interest in the Baylor Honors College scholarship program. As you might imagine, competition for scholarship funding is extremely competitive inasmuch as Honors College applicants are among the best students in the entire university. We remain intent upon offering you the finest possible education within our Honors College, and we very much hope to have you join us this upcoming fall semester. We also invite current students to apply each academic year for Honors College scholarships. Our aim is to reward excellent performance, and scholarship opportunities do exist for students that display a high level of merit during their time at Baylor. Please receive our best wishes as you prepare for the next steps of your education. We truly hope you will join the Baylor line and be a part of the Honors College with us in the fall. Scholarship Timeline (Rounds 1 and 2) Each student who confirms their intent to enroll in one of the four Honors College majors or programs by March 1 (Round 1) or April 1 (Round 2) is considered for an Honors College scholarship. Once accepted to an Honors College program, students should submit the Honors College Decision Form to confirm their acceptance. The committee reviews the student’s Baylor application, level of financial need as displayed through the FAFSA and CSS profile, and Honors College application (unnecessary if enrolling only in Great Texts). Students do not need to submit a deposit to Baylor in order to be considered. The confirmation for the Honors College is non-binding. All Great Texts majors will automatically be considered and do not need to submit the Honors College application or Decision Form to be eligible for the scholarship. Completing a FAFSA and/or CSS Profile is important for all Honors College students in order to maximize opportunities for endowed scholarship support, though it is not required for consideration. If selected to receive an award, students are notified via email in March (Round 1) or April (Round 2). Students who submit a confirmation between March 1 and April 1 will be considered for Round 2. The process is completed and closed in April. Invitation Only Scholarships: The Getterman Scholars Program Invitation to Excellence Distinguished Scholars Day Questions?
