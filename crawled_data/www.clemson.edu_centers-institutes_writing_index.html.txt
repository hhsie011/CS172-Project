Faculty Resources Clemson Home Centers and Institutes Current: Writing Lab Welcome to the Clemson Writing Lab! Our goal at the Writing Lab is to support all members of the Clemson community to become more confident and effective writers. For whatever you are working on, we can help you find the most effective way to communicate your message. Writers need feedback, sounding boards, and other people to coach them while they compose. At the Writing Lab, trained peer consultants will help you brainstorm, draft, and revise your projects. Any discipline. Any level. Any stage. Any genre. Any writer. If you have any questions, please email us at writinglab@clemson.edu. Supported by the Clemson University English Department. “ “I really appreciate everyone I have worked with in the Writing Lab because they have helped me with applications, papers, and lab reports.
