Leaves of an Hour Developing Literary and Popular Culture Collections at Brown University Library An exhibition mounted in conjunction with the Association of Research Libraries Symposium Building on Strength: Developing an ARL Agenda for Special Collections Working Symposium on the Future of Special Collections in Research Libraries June 27-29, 2001 Brown University Today, literary and popular culture collections at Brown University Library are very extensive, and are key components of the Library's research strengths. Centered in the Harris Collection of American Poetry and Plays, they encompass vast holdings of popular music, comics and graphic novels, broadsides, popular and genre fiction, science fiction and fantasy, true crime, film and television scripts, magic and magicana, theatrical ephemera, wit and humor, and pamphlet literature of every description, to name only the largest groups of material. It will be the purpose of this exhibition to document how Brown University Library developed its literary and popular culture collections over the course of two and a half centuries, and to demonstrate how that acquired affinity for collecting in areas outside the traditional definition of literature has informed collection building throughout Special Collections. 1754-1793 Early Literary Collections: The Williams Table & the 1973 Catalog 1793-1826 Early 19th Century Collections: The 1826 Catalog 1826-1848 Mid 19th Century Collections: Charles Coffin Jewett & the Catalogue of 1843 1850-1884 The Harris Collection: The Original Collectors 1848-1893 The Harris Collection & Late 19th Century Literary Collecting 1893-1930 The Harris Collection: Harry Lyman Koopman 1930-1965 The Harris Collection: S.
