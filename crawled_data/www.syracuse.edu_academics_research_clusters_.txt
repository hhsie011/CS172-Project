Research clusters are created by hiring multiple scholars into at least two schools/colleges in related areas, based on shared, multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary research interests. Cluster hires and academic cluster creation serve to align the University’s research to extramural funding trends, strengthen research activity, enhance faculty diversity and develop opportunities for student research and learning that responds to societal challenges. Syracuse University faculty and academic leadership have identified ten areas that: represent existing strength/niche areas at Syracuse University or a ground-breaking new area that will have transformational impact on the competitiveness and reputation of the University; include researchers from multiple colleges/schools and programs for collaborations; have the potential to leverage significant support from extramural grants or contracts; generate significant scholarship; and have the potential for significant scientific, economic, environmental and social impact.
