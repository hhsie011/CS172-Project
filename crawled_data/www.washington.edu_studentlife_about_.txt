Student Life Equity & Inclusion Statement The Division of Student Life acknowledges the Coast Salish people of this land, the land which touches the shared waters of all tribes and bands within the Suquamish, Tulalip, and Muckleshoot Nations. Student Life is committed to developing and maintaining an inclusive climate that honors the diverse array of students, faculty, and staff. We strive to provide pathways for success and to purposefully confront and dismantle existing physical, social, and psychological barriers for minoritized students and communities. We engage in this work while learning and demonstrating cultural humility. Supporting Student Success through Access, Diversity and Engagement The Division of Student Life at the University of Washington serves as a hub for a variety of programs, services, facilities and operations that are all designed to enrich the Husky Experience. To ensure a leading-edge student experience, we are committed to providing limitless opportunities for students to make the most of their time at the UW, by supporting their intellectual, physical and emotional development. As a division, we understand that student success is not solely defined by academic achievement. Through clubs and activities, leadership and service, and a dedicated network of mentors, students at the UW grow as individuals, embrace diversity and learn to engage in their communities. Our Units Led by Vice President for Student Life Denzil Suite, UW Student Life offers a wide range of programs and services that support students throughout their experience at the University of Washington, deepening their experiences both inside and outside the classroom.
