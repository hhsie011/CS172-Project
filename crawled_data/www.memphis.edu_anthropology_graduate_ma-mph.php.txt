This program is ideal for students who are interested in applying anthropological concerns for holism, sociocultural, political and economic context, and inequality to public health contexts, and for students who want a strong foundation in both qualitative and quantitative methods. The integration of a public health degree into anthropological training will provide students with a skill set familiar to employers and the ability to work in range of public health settings, with additional grounding in critical theory and the social sciences. Please review the Program Requirements for the Masters in Anthropology with a Concentration in Medical Anthropology.. Please review the Program Requirements for the Masters in Public Health. Prospective students should follow the application requirements for both programs and note your interest in the three-year integrated MA/MPH in each cover letter. Each program will conduct an independent review of applications. See the application instructions for the Anthropology MA. See the application instructions for the MPH. The Department of Anthropology offers a competitive funding package, and we are able to support many of our students. If awarded a Graduate Assistantship, students will work 20 hours a week to assist faculty with research and other duties and will receive a stipend and tuition waiver. Please contact our Graduate Coordinator, Dr. Ted Maclin (emaclin1@memphis.edu), for additional information about potential funding or any other aspect of the application process. We further encourage students to reach out about planning a visit to campus and to the department. Once accepted, students may count up to nine credit-hours in Public Health towards the MA in Anthropology. These nine hours will normally include substituting three credit-hours of PUBH 7985 Practicum for 3 credit-hours of ANTH 7985 Practicum. Students will also work with their advisors to develop a practicum project that will serve the learning goals and requirements of both programs.
