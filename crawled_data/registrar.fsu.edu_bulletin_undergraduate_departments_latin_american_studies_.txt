Interdisciplinary by design, cooperating departments support innovative blends of teaching and research with the goal of providing undergraduates a solid grasp of Latin America’s present and past, and emphasizing major aspects of the region’s unique structures. Additionally, majors and minors are encouraged to participate in the related programs in Costa Rica and Panama. As the intellectual home for an interdisciplinary community of scholars, students, and visitors, LACS supports a range of research and teaching amid a broader array of sponsored lectures, cultural events, and internships. The baccalaureate program may be viewed as preparation for graduate school in various fields or as leading to professions in government and international service, multinational commerce, law, teaching, and translation. Computer Skills Competency All undergraduates at Florida State University must demonstrate basic computer skills competency prior to graduation. As necessary computer competency skills vary from discipline to discipline, each major determines the courses needed to satisfy this requirement. Undergraduate majors in Latin American and Caribbean studies satisfy this requirement by earning a grade of “C–” or higher in any course at FSU which meets the liberal studies computer competency designation, though it is strongly recommended that students take either CGS 2060 or CGS 2100 in order to satisfy this requirement. Requirements for a Major in Latin American and Caribbean Studies Students majoring in the program are to construct their study program around three components: (1) a language requirement, (2) an area-specific coursework requirement, and (3) a concepts and theories requirement. LAS 2004 (Professional Development for Latin American Caribbean Studies Major) is a required course for this program and counts towards total hour requirements. The total hour requirements for the major are thirty-six semester hours beyond the liberal studies requirements (with a grade of “C–” or better in each of the Latin American and Caribbean studies courses). As this is an interdisciplinary program, no minor is required. In addition to a 2.0 overall GPA, all students must meet “mapping” requirements. See https://www.academic-guide.fsu.edu/ for more information. Language Requirement All students are also required to complete relevant area language coursework to the intermediate level or demonstrate proficiency to the intermediate college level in Spanish, Portuguese, French, or some other relevant area language (at 2200 level or equivalent course). Students are encouraged to bring their chosen language up to an effective level of proficiency in reading, writing, and speaking by either taking additional coursework on the campus of Florida State University or by participating in a semester- or summer-abroad program in their relevant cultural area as such programs become available. These programs should be administered by, affiliated with, or approved by Florida State University. To encourage the achievement of language proficiency, language coursework hours taken beyond the intermediate college level may be counted toward the required thirty-six semester hours for the major. Area Specific Course Requirement Students are to select at least twenty-four semester hours of area specific coursework from the approved list of area-specific courses below. Note that special topic area-specific courses may be approved from time to time; for the most current list, students are encouraged to view the term-specific course lists posted on the International Studies Canvas site and available in the advising office in 105 Bellamy and the program office in 211 Bellamy. Concept and Theory Course Requirement Students are to select at least six semester hours of coursework from the approved list of concept and theory courses. Students should carefully select these courses in consultation with their academic advisor to ensure that the courses meet any required prerequisites for the approved courses. Additional Course Requirement The remaining six credit hours may be selected from any approved Latin American and Caribbean Studies course and/or approved internship (INR 4941). Latin American and Caribbean Studies Major with an emphasis in Business This degree program combines the regular Latin American and Caribbean studies major with a planned series of business courses. The requirements for this degree are to complete relevant area language coursework to the intermediate level or demonstrate proficiency to the intermediate college level in Spanish, Portuguese, French, or some other relevant area language; twenty-one semester hours in Latin American and Caribbean studies coursework; and fifteen semester hours in multinational business courses. The Latin American and Caribbean studies coursework is to be selected from the area specific courses. With this degree, there is no concepts and theories requirement. Students are also to select between two fifteen semester hour business coursework options listed below: an international marketing track or an international finance track. The prerequisites for both tracks include ECO 2013 and 2023, which may be taken as part of the student’s liberal studies requirements. In addition, students opting for the international finance track must complete ACG 2021 as a prerequisite. Students should seek advising from the Latin American and Caribbean Studies program advisor in 211 Bellamy about registering for business courses.

The programs in Panama and Costa Rica offer relevant coursework. See https://international.fsu.edu/ for more information on the various options available through Florida State International Programs Students should consult with the Latin American and Caribbean Studies Director about any other study abroad programs they wish to pursue. Coursework taken in overseas locations must be approved in advance for credit toward the major. Internship The Latin American and Caribbean Studies program encourages students to take advantage of internships with an area focus. Information on possible placements can be found on the International Studies Canvas site. All internships must be approved the semester before the internship takes place. See the Latin American and Caribbean Studies program advisor in 211 Bellamy for further information. Honors in the Major The Program in Latin American and Caribbean Studies offers honors in the major to encourage talented juniors and seniors to undertake independent and original work as part of the undergraduate experience. For requirements and other information, see the “University Honors Office and Honor Societies” chapter of this General Bulletin. Second Majors Majors in Latin American and Caribbean Studies may pursue a second major. When students pursue a second major, they may count six semester hours of coursework toward both majors. Minor in Latin American and Caribbean Studies Students pursuing a minor in the program must complete eighteen semester hours of Latin American and Caribbean studies coursework beyond the liberal studies requirement. In this case none of the broader comparative concepts and theories courses will count toward the eighteen semester hour minimum. Students may select freely from all area-specific courses. Modern languages courses numbered above 2999 may count toward the minor. Nine of the eighteen semester hours must be numbered above 2999. A maximum combined total of six semester hours in internship or directed individual study may apply to the minor. Approved Courses Note: Descriptions of specific courses can be found under the individual departments in which they are taught. In addition to the courses listed below, special topics courses may be approved by the program director in any particular term. These courses appear on the term course lists and are available at the International Studies Canvas Organization site, the advising office in 105 Bellamy, and the program office in 211 Bellamy.
