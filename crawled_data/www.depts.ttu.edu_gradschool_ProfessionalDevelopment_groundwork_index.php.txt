Like the TEACH Program, the Groundwork Program originated at the Teaching, Learning, and Professional Development Center in 2013, and now operates under the auspices of the TTU Graduate School. Groundwork is a face-to-face, 2 ½ day program of workshops, discussions, readings, and hands-on micro-teaching activities. Participants in Groundwork will be exposed to the fundamentals of college teaching such as syllabus and student learning outcome creation, classroom management, active learning, and other strategies for engaging students. One of the most notable parts of Groundwork is the microteaching opportunity. Microteaching has been used for decades to help teachers get practical, hands-on experience in teaching in a supportive environment with feedback. In the Groundwork Program, you'll teach a ten-minute mini-lesson to an assigned interdisciplinary peer group, followed by feedback from your peers and a trained Groundwork facilitator. Moreover, these lessons will be recorded, giving you a chance to view your own teaching from the students' perspective. On the following day, you'll meet again in your groups to discuss your experiences. Eligibility Groundwork is open to all Texas Tech Master's, Doctoral, and Post-Doctoral students who submit an application and are accepted to participate. A teaching appointment is NOT required and students graduating in December 2019 are eligible to participate. Past Groundwork participants and current and former TEACH Program Fellows are ineligible. Groundwork will be limited to 40 participants. Application Process For information regarding Groundwork Program applications, please contact Dr. Kristi Gaines (Associate Dean, Graduate School). Comments from Past Participants: “Useful, practical techniques I can implement NOW. Great instructors, who are fun, funny, engaging, love what they do and are passionate about it.” “The breadth of topics covered was really great. I had many of my questions and concerns about teaching answered. The staff and instructors were all really engaging and welcoming as well.” “The instructors/counselors were great role models who practiced what they preached and made everything we learned real for us by actually teaching at a high level. The coursework covered all the dollar issues and did so effectively. The grouping allowed us to meet with students/instructors from other disciplines and expand our minds and our repertoire. The materials provided (food included) were appropriate and much appreciated.” “Great and friendly environment. Teaching experience (microteaching) with peer and expert feedback. Sessions on several aspects of teaching like from the syllabus to feedback. Hands-on activities and suggestions for sticky situations.” Grant management software provided by WizeHive.
