It was only a short 10 months later, in July 1948, when the Air Force and Baylor University partnered in the creation of AFROTC Detachment 810 -- one of the first Air Force ROTC detachments in the nation. Army ROTC Army ROTC is a diverse group of men and women with more than 20,000 cadets currently enrolled across the country. The Baylor University Bear Battalion is proud to be one the 273 host schools that produce approximately 60 percent of the second lieutenants who join the active Army, Army Reserve and Army National Guard. Aviation Science The Baylor Institute for Air Science was created in 1991 with the goal of advancing the university's mission through research, public service and the education of a new generation of pilots. In the same year, the institute initiated the Bachelor of Science in Aviation Sciences (BSA) degree, and graduated its first class in 1995. The degree provides a balance of aeronautical theory and application combined with an impeccable college education. Baylor Interdisciplinary Core The Baylor Interdisciplinary Core (BIC) is one of the programs in the Honors College. It provides an alternative way for students to explore Baylor's core curriculum. Instead of taking the traditional general education requirements, BIC students learn about these subjects by taking a challenging and integrated curriculum. Great Texts Program In the Great Texts Program at Baylor, students read the greatest works composed by the greatest minds. They discuss the books in small classes that are taught as seminars, not lectures. Honors Program The Honors Program, established in 1959, is designed to enrich the academic experience of highly motivated students at Baylor University. The program supplements traditional degree requirements and majors in all departments and schools of the university by offering smaller, distinctive classes, interdisciplinary approaches, and opportunities to pursue research with faculty mentors. Study Abroad and Exchange Programs Studying abroad is a wonderful opportunity to explore the world, offering invaluable opportunities to grow by gaining new perspectives about the world you live in all while improving advancing your skills, independence and self-confidence. And the international experiences you gain also go a long way toward setting you apart from other job seekers when you graduate. University Scholars Program Baylor's University Scholars Program is designed for outstanding students who seek a liberal education, and choose two or more concentrations, often in diverse disciplines. University Scholars cultivates a broad base of knowledge and skills across the arts and sciences and may include professional studies. Students explore widely and experience the breadth of Baylor’s course offerings.
