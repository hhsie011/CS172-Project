Link Supplemental Life Insurance for Employees Link You can purchase additional life insurance in increments of one to ten times your annual salary, not to exceed $2,000,000. A Statement of Health is required if you elect supplemental life coverage above $250,000 upon hire, or if you decide in the future to increase your supplemental life insurance coverage. For any increases after your new hire enrollment, the coverage will not go into effect until MetLife notifies Human Resources of its approval.

Actual deductions from each paycheck will vary depending upon your deduction cycle. Follow the examples to estimate your cost. Your actual cost will display when you enroll in MySlice. Calculating Your Cost for Employee Supplemental Life Insurance Find your rate based on your age in the chart below (for example, the rate for a 40-year-old is $0.065). Multiply your annual salary by the level you want to get the total coverage amount (for example, 3 x $50,000 = $150,000). If this is not an even number, round up to the next highest thousand (for example, $147,672 becomes $148,000). Divide the coverage amount by 1,000 (for example, $150,000 divided by 1,000 = $150) Multiply by the rate from the chart ($150 x $0.065 = $9.75). This is the monthly amount. To determine the amount that will be deducted from each paycheck, multiply by 12 and divide by the number of checks you receive in a year: Paid weekly over the fiscal year: 52 pays Paid weekly over the academic year: 37 pays Paid semi-monthly over the fiscal year: 24 pays Paid semi-monthly over the academic year: 18 pays Employee Age Rates Monthly Cost per Thousand Under age 25 $0.027 25 through 29 $0.032 30 through 34 $0.043 35 through 39 $0.049 40 through 44 $0.065 45 through 49 $0.093 50 through 54 $0.147 55 through 59 $0.260 60 through 64 $0.396 65 through 69 $0.689 Age 70 and up $1.225 Should you have any questions, please reach out to our HR Shared Services team at 315.443.4042.
