Admission requirements Inside the Program Honors student improves leadership while helping others As an Honors major, Sarah Myose had the opportunity to help out in the community by teaching a weekly pre-literacy class at the Wichita Indochinese Center. They introduced immigrants and refugees to the basic English needed to fill out forms and applications, often to help with employment, health care or education. Myose used the hands-on experience to improve their leadership skills. “I came in not feeling really very confident about my soft skills, being able to teach people and be in that leadership position,” they said. “I learned more about how I can react in a position where I’m the teacher, where I’m the one with some of the leadership authority.” Curriculum The 24-credit-hour minor comprises 12 credit hours within the Emory Lindquist Honors Scholars program and the completion of a 12-credit-hour Honors interdisciplinary track.
