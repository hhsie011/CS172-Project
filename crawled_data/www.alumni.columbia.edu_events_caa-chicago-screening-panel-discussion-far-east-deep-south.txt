The film is an award-winning feature documentary. Far East Deep South explores the seldom-told history of Chinese immigrants living in the American South during the late 1800s to mid-1900s through the eyes of Charles Chiu and his family as they travel from California to Mississippi to find answers about his father, K.C. Lou. You’ll enjoy watching this significant contribution to American history through the framing narrative of a father's desire to "not want to know" and a family’s insistence on exploring the mysteries of the past. Four Private Film Screening Dates: Sunday, March 13, 2022-Wednesday, March 16, 2022. We provide you with a link to watch the film at home that lasts for four days. Panel Discussion Date: Wednesday, March 16, 2022 Panel Discussion Time: 8 p.m. Central Daylight Time. Cost: $10.00 per registrant to access the film link.
