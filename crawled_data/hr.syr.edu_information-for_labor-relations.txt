With that goal in mind, while representing the best interests of the University, we engage in collaboration and ongoing communication with the Unions representing Syracuse University staff as we develop strategies aimed at strengthening positive relationships among unionized employees, and between unionized employees and University Management. SU Labor Relations works to ensure fair and equitable applications of University policies, processes and provisions of the applicable collective bargaining agreement to the overall benefit of Management and Labor. We engage in conflict resolution, grievance management, and mediation to timely address labor and employment matters and find effective resolution. In doing so, SU Labor Relations also partners with other key University divisions such as the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity, Inclusion and Resolution Services, the Department of Public Safety, and Risk Management and Regulatory Compliance Services, to support the University’s best interests while simultaneously promote fair outcomes.
