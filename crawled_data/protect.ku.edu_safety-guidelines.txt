This includes: Between people who are in close contact with one another. Close contact is within approximately six feet. Through respiratory droplets (aerosol transmission) produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These drops can land in the mouths, noses, or eyes of nearby people and could potentially be inhaled into the lungs. The virus is believed to survive on surfaces and may be spread by contact when a person touches a surface and then touches their face, nose, eyes, etc. The virus is most transmissible from individuals who are symptomatic with fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath. Asymptomatic individuals may also transmit the virus Health Safety Guidelines These health safety requirements are for all members of the KU community to follow while they are on KU property or affiliated work/travel. We are providing a self-screening tool to help individuals monitor their health to check for any symptoms. Here is the link to that tool: KU COVID-19 Health Assessment Form. Follow local and/or county health guidelines and mandates. If you are exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms, you should not go to any KU facility or property. If you believe you have been exposed, or have been identified by health professionals as part of a contact investigation, you must isolate for 14 days. If you require COVID-19 testing, coordinate with Watkins Health Services or LMH Health (see Testing & Reporting for additional information). Use disinfectant wipes (provided in all spaces) to clean all personal surfaces. Wash your hands often throughout the day. Recommended times to wash hands: Between classes and/or meetings After handling mail or packages Before and after eating After touching door handles, light switches, desks, or other communal items When handwashing is not practical, use hand sanitizer to clean your hands. Do not touch your face, eyes, or nose. Use good etiquette, such as covering your mouth when you cough or sneeze.
