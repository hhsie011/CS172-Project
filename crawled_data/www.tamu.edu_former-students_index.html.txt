Many of Texas A&M's more than 508,000 former students are icons in their career and pillars of their community. And let's not forget about the distinctive Aggie Ring, an outward symbol designed more than 100 years ago, that identifies former students as Aggies and connects them to the Aggie Network. Through the Texas A&M Foundation, the 12th Man Foundation, The Association of Former Students, George & Barbara Bush Foundation and the Texas Aggie Corps of Cadets Association, former students provide tangible evidence of their deep-rooted loyalty to Texas A&M by contributing millions of dollars each year to support our university.
