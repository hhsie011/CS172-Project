You know, things have changed a great deal in the last decade with respect to Law School technology, both here at Baylor Law, and throughout academia. Technology has truly become a part of the landscape and has made the transition from a cool utility for specific applications to a part of the very fabric of both education and our lives. The information technology department at Baylor Law strives to provide you with the highest level of service and support possible while continuing to focus on innovation and modernization. I believe that the most important aspect of our mission is to provide faculty, staff and students with an unparalleled level of support in all areas of technology. Our goal is to provide an access rich environment, a law school environment where access to electronic resources is available anytime and everywhere within the building. With over fifteen hundred wired connections, wired study carrels and a robust wireless network servicing the entire building, I believe we have achieved that objective! The IT Department is staffed by three highly experienced and service oriented professionals. We are here to answer your questions, to provide advice and solutions and to solve your problems. We have an open door policy and enjoy our daily interaction with both colleagues and students. What sets us apart? You are the priority, not the technology.
