Since then, Brown—thanks in part to the Center for the Study of Slavery and Justice (CSSJ)—has become the model and the standard bearer for the nation’s universities when it comes to confronting the contemporary implications of racial slavery. Other institutions take inspiration from our rigorous work and collaborative approach to research, teaching, and public engagement that spans the humanities, arts, and sciences. Through investments in professorships, fellowships, and internships for graduate and undergraduate students, the center will: Increase its capacity to convene the scholars and practitioners whose interdisciplinary work addresses some of the most complex obstacles to a just, free, and democratic society. Train the next generation of teachers and create new courses of study with support for postdoctoral and graduate fellows. Intervene in and transform critical public debates about the criminal justice system, present-day human trafficking, the contemporary demands of citizenship, and issues of justice, freedom, and equality. Together, we will multiply the possibilities for a deeper public understanding of the world's most difficult and historically rooted problems. “ To think about racial slavery is to grapple with how slavery shaped the modern world — and to consider human rights, justice and freedom in an interdisciplinary context and their significance for our world today. ” B.
