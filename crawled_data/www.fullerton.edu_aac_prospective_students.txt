Once students are admitted to the university, the Academic Advising Center is often one of the first offices freshmen encounter. We are here to help students understand the steps to take to earn their degrees. The requirements may seem daunting at first, but with guidance and advising students make their way just fine! According to data from the Statistical Report of California Community College Transfers to the California State University System. Cal State Fullerton enrolls the largest number of transfer students from California Community Colleges of all of the 23 CSU campuses. If you are planning to transfer to Cal State Fullerton, you are not alone! New transfer students visit our Academic Advising Center each day and many of these students share similar questions. The Transfer Section of our website should answer many of those questions and support you as you prepare to transfer. If you have remaining questions after becoming an admitted student and completing your new student orientation, please feel free to visit our office in UH 123B. You must bring in a copy of your unofficial transcripts and a copy (paper or electronic) of your Titan Degree Audit to be seen by advisor. Thinking about transferring to Cal State Fullerton?
