As this vision is realized through faculty, staff, and student efforts, the program continues a tradition of national leadership. Graduate Programs We offer three programs of study: Counselor Education Mental Health Counseling School Counseling Program Characteristics right arrow down arrow Our Program encompasses considerable diversity, both in terms of demographics and experience, adding substantial richness to the student body. Students are expected to gain their professional license and certification to become actively involved in service provision, program evaluation, and scholarship to improve the lives of their clients. The Counseling Program faculty is comprised of eight and a half full-time counselor educators, providing a desirable faculty to student ratio. Areas of special faculty expertise reside in ecological approaches to: career development, community counseling, multicultural counseling, trauma/traumatic stress, and chemical dependency. Research right arrow down arrow Studying People and their Environments: Using Science to Help the Underserved The doctoral program is profiting from infusion of the vision adopted by faculty in 1999 that emphasizes ecological applications of counseling to diverse and underserved populations. In addition, problem-based learning is being utilized among multiple disciplines on the university campus and in community arenas. Graduate students play a key role in leading some of these efforts. Ongoing projects are focused in several areas including: evidence-based practices to improve substance abuse treatment, the relationship between systemic oppression and mental health concerns, assessment of training standards, increased knowledge about effective counseling interventions, particularly with underserved populations, and exploration of ways to improve the lives of persons with special physical and mental health needs in schools and other community settings. Facilities right arrow down arrow The UC Counseling Program is located in Teachers-Dyer Complex, a historic campus building located on the main campus of UC. Full computer and counseling laboratory facilities are available for student use. The University Library contains a complete collection of scholarly resources in Counseling and allied fields, including the provision for electronic access of materials. Diversity, Social Justice, and Inclusion Statement right arrow down arrow The Counseling Program at the University of Cincinnati embraces diversity, equity, and advocacy as core values. Thus, we affirm the dignity and worth of all people, emphasizing inclusion, social justice, and mutual acceptance. Operating from an ecological model of wellness, we are committed to developing a climate where students faculty, and staff are encouraged to actively explore and critically evaluate their personal and professional attitudes, beliefs, and values adopting an attitude of cultural humility. We strive to create a supportive training environment promoting multicultural awareness, knowledge, skills, and experiences. In all these efforts, we align with UC's Mission and Notice of Non-Discrimination as well as the American Counseling Associations (ACA) Code of Ethics and the ACA divisions and affiliates standards and positions on human rights, in service to our clients, students, and the community at large.
