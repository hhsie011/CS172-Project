But we are still seeing new cases, and daily case reports remain higher than in previous surges, especially in certain parts of the country, so it is important that we all continue to be careful and vigilant. If you are eligible, please get your booster and upload the information as instructed in yesterdayâ€™s email. We also wanted to take a moment to highlight a recent update in the CDC recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination schedule for moderately or severely immunocompromised people. The current recommendation for moderately or severely immunocompromised people is to receive a 3-dose primary series, with the third dose given 28 days after the second dose. A booster dose is recommended 5 months after completing the primary series to enhance or restore protection against COVID-19 which may have decreased over time. Please see this helpful CDC page that walks through the various scenarios. Finally, while we know it may be disappointing that the COVID-19 vaccine authorization for younger children was delayed until the FDA can review the data from an ongoing trial of a third vaccine dose in these younger children, it does illustrate the robustness and diligence of the FDA review process. We look forward to seeing the trial data later in the spring. Thank you and stay safe!
