With this PhD, I hope to advance our tools in search for and our knowledge of Earth’s deep ocean life. I plan to characterize the survival strategies of bacteria in methane clathrates, specifically proteins excreted by bacteria that may bind and alter methane clathrate stability. Methane clathrates store gigatons of the greenhouse gas, methane, and have relevance to potential methane clathrate reservoirs on planets, such as Mars, and moons, like Titan. Upon receiving a PhD, I plan to continue my career path in academia, with the goals of researching the mysteries of our deep ocean and educating our future generations.
