Reducing the campus drive-alone rate reduces emissions and other impacts, but also increases accessibility for those moving around the community. Led by Transportation Services and in alignment with State of Washington Commuter Trip Reduction law and the Campus Master Plan, UW will continue to reduce drive-alone commutes until they are only 12% of Seattle campus commutes.
