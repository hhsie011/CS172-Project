In 2017, the demand for natural gas in China had an explosive growth, with a phenomenal gas shortage during the winter. The conflict between supply and demand of natural gas has attracted great attention from all parties. In 2018, one of the priorities of the newly established Ministry of Ecology and the Environment is still to optimize the reform of energy structure, to promote coal to gas, and to develop clean energy. During China's Two Sessions in 2018, "supply of Natural gas," "unity of natural gas price," and "strategic reservation of natural gas" were all frequently mentioned. As a relatively efficient clean energy, natural gas will occupy an increasingly important position in China's energy market. The development of natural gas is also an inevitable trend of China's energy transition. In the future, it will become a heated topic about the planning and adjustment of the natural gas industry and how China handles the conflicts between supply and demand of natural gas and regional imbalances. On March 29 at Columbia Global Centers | Beijing, Mr. David Sandalow, Inaugural Fellow at the Center on Global Energy Policy and Co-Director of the Energy and Environment Concentration at the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University, invites the most authoritative experts in China's natural gas industry, Mr. Fu Chengyu and Ms. Li Yalan, to discuss the status quo and prospects of China's natural gas market, and the future opportunities and challenges of natural gas cooperation between China and the United States.
