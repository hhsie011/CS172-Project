Location Lenfest Center for the Arts 615 W 129th St New York, NY Visit website About The Performance by Sam Grabiner Directed by Keenan Tyler Oliphant An audience gathers. They sit in a circle. And the actors begin to tell them a story… We are in a prehistoric forest and the trees are dying. Two strangers meet on the outskirts of an ancient city. An iPhone buzzes in a small boat on a stormy sea at night. As epic as it is intimate, People on Earth takes us on a three-hundred-million-year journey from primordial extinction, through to the not-so-distant future. A play about human progress. And what is lost along the way.
