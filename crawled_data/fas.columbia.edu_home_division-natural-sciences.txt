Columbia’s Arts and Sciences science faculty include 240 faculty members across nine academic departments: Astronomy; Biology; Chemistry; Earth and Environmental Sciences; Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology; Math; Physics; Psychology; and Statistics. Together with hundreds of undergraduate majors, graduate students, and post-docs, we are a community advancing fundamental knowledge and committed to solving the world's most daunting challenges in health, technology, and the environment. From the discovery of deuterium to proving plate tectonic theory and the astronomical theory of ice age cycles, to the development of laser and radar and the detection of gravitational waves, to groundbreaking innovations in population genetics and cancer genomics, distinguished Columbia scientists have led innovation and creative interdisciplinary collaborations for decades. Columbia Science Commits is a five-year fund-raising sprint to advance Columbia’s science faculty, research, education, and diversity. Our goal is to invest in A&S Science faculty and labs to inspire our scientists to pursue transformative research, find solutions to urgent challenges, and support the next generation of scientific leaders. A focused and creative commitment to equity and diversity will help enhance science faculty recruitment, retention, and support. Robert D. Mawhinney, Dean of Natural Science Science Initiative Many of the world's greatest discoveries have been made in the natural sciences in the Arts and Sciences at Columbia University. Building on this distinguished history we have launched the Science Initative to renew the Columbia's leadership and guide the University to scientific pre-eminence over the next decade. « MORE » Announcements Szabolcs Marka and 7 scientists and grad students in Physics among the recepients of a Breakthrough Prize honoring the discovery of gravitational waves.
