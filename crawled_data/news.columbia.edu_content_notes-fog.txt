Delving into sex, death, shame and the indignities of the body, he draws a bizarre but recognizable universe. In “The Grow-Light Blues,” a corporate drone finds love after being disfigured testing his employer’s newest nutrition supplement—the enhanced glow from his computer monitor. A father finds himself outcast from his family when he starts to suspect that his son’s precocity has turned sinister in “Cold Little Bird.” In “Blueprints for St. Louis,” two architects consider the ethics of artificially inciting emotion in mourners at their latest assignment—a memorial to a terrorist attack. It is a collection that showcases Marcus’ compassion, tenderness and humor. 212-854-5573 [email protected] Genre Fiction Topic Arts Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
