Now, this riveting contemporary masterpiece arrives at the Met, with Neil Armfield, who directed the work's premiere, bringing his acclaimed staging to New York. Many of the original cast members have followed, including tenor Allan Clayton in the title role. Nicholas Carter makes his Met debut conducting a remarkable ensemble, which also features soprano Brenda Rae as Ophelia, mezzo-soprano Sarah Connolly as Gertrude, baritone Rod Gilfry as Claudius, and Canadian bass-baritone John Relyea as the ghost of Hamlet's father.
