With more than a dozen departments and programs ranging from first-generation initiatives to career services and from on-campus housing, recreation, and student financial aid to the veterans and military resource center, the student affairs division focuses on student success. We care deeply about our students' wellbeing and endeavor to co-create a student ready community where students establish meaningful connections with each other and faculty, staff, and alumni. This year, we are excited to carefully restore in-person instruction and activities. The U-Dub Tacoma Pack is Back, and we remain steadfast in our commitment to expand access to a university education, promote civic engagement, and facilitate career readiness. I invite you to engage with our campus and explore the many opportunities that we have to offer. Be Purple. Be Gold. Be Bold. Go Dawgs!
