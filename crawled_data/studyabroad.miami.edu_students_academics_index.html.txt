With language, liberal arts, fine arts, science, business, engineering, and internship programs in over 35 countries, we offer study abroad opportunities for students from all majors and interests. As you begin to plan your study abroad experience, it is important to select a program that aligns with your academic goals. We believe that study abroad is an integral part of a Miami undergraduate experience. Mapping out a plan of study that will include study abroad is an important part of the conversations that you’ll have with your academic advisor. Consider what you want to study when you’re abroad. Which programs offer the areas of study and experience that most interest you? Review the courses offered on the programs that you’re considering as well as requirements that you can fulfill towards your degree requirements. Once you find a program or even before, when you start to think about the possibility of study abroad, it is crucial to check with your academic advisor to discuss how study abroad will fit into your academic plan. UM Study Abroad is not able to advise on course equivalencies or substitutions, or courses counting toward majors and minors—only your academic advisor and school can do that—so plan to meet with your advisor early in the thought/planning process. Once you find a program that interests you, check the program page on Miami’s Study Abroad website to see the course offerings.
