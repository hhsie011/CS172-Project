Legal name identifies an individual on official government records such as U.S. social security cards, state licenses, passports, and marriage or divorce decrees. Boston College's student information system, transcript, diploma, and degree verifications reflect an individual's legal name. All official documents related to student records at Boston College reflect the legal name of an individual. Students who do not want their legal name made available in the Boston College Directory should consider restricting access to Directory information, in accordance with the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Changes to Directory information may be updated by the student in the Agora Portal by selecting "Address/Alias Settings" under "Common Services." Restricting name and other information in the Boston College Directory does not mean that this information is anonymous to University faculty and staff, but rather to those outside of the University. A Boston College student who has completed a legal name change in Massachusetts or another state may update the name on their Boston College student record via the Legal Name Change form. Documentation of the legal name change must be submitted to the University. Upon receipt of this form and the required documentation, the legal name will then be updated on the official student record. Update Your Preferred Display Name in Canvas For information on how to update your preferred display name and desired pronoun in Canvas, visit the Canvas Resources page maintained by the Center for Teaching Excellence. Create a Preferred Alias in Gmail and the University Directory To create a preferred alias for use in Gmail and the University Directory, log into the Portal and select "Address/Alias Settings" under "Common Services." Be sure to specify to the IT Help Desk that you would like an alias for your e-mail account and for the Directory search. Once complete, you will be able to use both your existing e-mail and directory information as well as your new preferred name e-mail and directory information.
