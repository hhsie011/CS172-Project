My research focuses on how tropical cyclone frequency changes with the climate. During my PhD, I studied a range of topics using theory and modeling, including the interaction between moist convection and baroclinic cyclones, as well as the interaction between Rossby waves and midlatitude jets. Outside of research, I enjoy water sports, even though I get seasick easily. I grew up near the ocean, but I am allergic to seafood. Tropical cyclones played a big part in my childhood. The more I learn about them, the more I am humbled by the wonder of nature, and the more I hope to contribute to a society better prepared for natural disasters.
