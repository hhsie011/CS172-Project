Reed, a distinguished professor at Dartmouth who passed away in 1990. Dr. Reed held a strong belief in the importance of education through teaching, research, and mentoring. In honor of Dr. Reed, Graduate Students of the Department of Biological Sciences at Dartmouth College annually select and invite a distinguished scholar who exemplifies the ideals to which Dr. Reed was so committed. As part of the visit, the Chris Reed Scholar gives a lecture of broad interest to graduate students and that is also open to the public. Additionally, the visiting scholar normally stays in Hanover for two or three days as our guest to visit the area and interact with Dartmouth graduate students in the spirit of Professor Reed. Chris Reed scholars have included: William Provine, Bruce Levin, Pierre Beguin, David Wake, Naomi Cappuccino, James Crow, Peter and Rosemary Grant, Richard Lewontin, Douglas Futuyma and Anurag Agrawal. Logistics The Chris Reed seminar depends upon Biology graduate students taking the initiative to choose a speaker, extend the invitation, and arrange suitable dates. This requires that there be a couple of graduate students who volunteer to act as organizers. The process normally involves soliciting nominations from all graduate students in the Department of Biological Sciences (MCB and EEB), then having a group discussion to choose a ranked list of two or three candidates. The best candidates tend to have busy schedules so it is best to choose candidates and proffer the invitation 6 - 18 months in advance. Previous graduate student organizers and faculty will be pleased to assist. Please consult with the organizer of the Cramer Seminar Series regarding suitable dates.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Biological Sciences Undergraduate Overview Welcome Class of 2026 Welcome Back Classes of 2023, 2024, 2025 Major & Minor Course Schedules & Syllabi Current and Upcoming Bio 11 and Foundation Classes First Year Writing Seminars - Biology 7 Biology 11 Foundation Course Offerings Foundation Level Course Syllabi Intermediate Level Course Syllabi Advanced Level Course Syllabi Non-Major Course Syllabi Foreign Study Program Faculty Advisors Teaching Science Fellows Independent Study & the Honors Program Research Opportunities Dartmouth-sponsored Research Programs Funding and Finding an Advisor Transfer Credits Graduate Overview Ecology, Evolution, Environment & Society Molecular and Cellular Biology Research Overview Resources & Research Facilities Life Sciences Light Microscopy Facility Faculty Publications Neukom Postdoctoral Fellowship Foreign Study Program Seminars, News & Events News & Events Cramer Seminar Series Chris Reed Memorial Lecture Past Symposia and Conferences Travel People SEPA My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
