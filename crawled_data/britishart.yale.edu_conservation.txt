A conservation imaging room is used for technical documentation, including X-radiography, X-ray fluorescence analysis, and infrared imaging. Additional studio space and analytical laboratories are located at the Collection Studies Center at Yale’s West Campus. Learn more Engagement Beyond collections care, the department contributes to Yale’s educational mission by engaging with the university’s staff, students, and faculty; the Center’s visiting scholars; and the public through tours, lectures, classes, and workshops.
