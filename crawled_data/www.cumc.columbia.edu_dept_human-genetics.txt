Site Navigation 'The study of genetic variation in humans has major implications for medicine and for understanding human biology and diversity. Human genetics has been empowered and reinvigorated by the sequencing of the human genome as well as the genomes of several other species. The Human Genetics Resources Core at Columbia University Medical Center was created to facilitate genetic research in human populations throughout the University. When first established our main function included the immortalization and growth of lymphoblast cell lines, extraction of DNA and storage of these samples for future analysis. The laboratory has expanded to serve the needs of Columbia researchers offering the manipulation, preparation and storage of biological samples; a database management system for tracking of laboratory and clinical research information; and a team of analysts to facilitate or assist in study design and statistical analysis of genetic data. This core should be viewed as a University resource for all departments, centers and institutes that wish to conduct genetic research in human populations.' Richard Mayeux, MD, MSc.
