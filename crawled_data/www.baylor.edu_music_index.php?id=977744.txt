Ensembles at Baylor are one credit hour courses for which enrollment is required to participate. The audition or placement process varies by ensemble. Please see below for details regarding ensemble placement for incoming freshman and transfer students that are non-music majors. Choral Ensemble Auditions (virtual) Choir auditions will take place via online form and unlisted YouTube video submission throughout the summer (bit.ly/BaylorChoirAuditions). If an audition is not possible before the fall, additional audition times will be scheduled August 19-22, as schedules and current in-person guidelines permit. You may not enroll in a choir unless you have received a placement email from a choir director: Dr. Stephen Gusukuma, Dr. Lynne Gackle, or Dr. Randall Bradley. If you have an advising appointment and are interested in choir but do not have an email from one of the faculty members listed above regarding your audition placement, please contact Dr. Stephen Gusukuma (Stephen_Gusukuma@baylor.edu) to complete an audition or sign up for an August placement. Incoming freshman will be placed into one or two of the following ensembles: Concert Choir – MUEN 1107 Men’s Choir – MUEN 1121 Women’s Choir – MUEN 1124 Marching Band Placement Marching Band rehearses MWF from 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM, plays at all home football games, a small number of away games, and at bowl games. The time commitment is significantly less than what incoming students would likely have experienced in high school. Students are allowed to register for Marching Band (MUEN 1102-01) without a formal audition. Information is provided on the website (www.baylor.edu/gwb). Any student interested in registering for Golden Wave Marching Band may be registered by their advisor, but we ask for the student to contact Dr. Isaiah_Odajima@Baylor.edu immediately so the student can begin the uniform pre-fitting procedures and receive important schedules/information. Hand Bell Choir (virtual) The Baylor Bronze Handbell Ensemble (MUEN 1125) has students with varied ringing experience. Although this is not an auditioned ensemble, those interested in joining the group should have some experience ringing handheld instruments. Please email the Director of Baylor Bronze, Bob_Avant@Baylor.edu, if interested. Campus Orchestra (virtual) The Baylor Campus Orchestra (MUEN 1101-02) is designed to provide an orchestral experience for those students whose schedules will not permit them to commit to the rigorous time or literature demands of the Baylor Symphony, or who lack the experience necessary to prepare music at the accelerated pace required by the Baylor Symphony. Campus Orchestra does not currently require an audition. Please email Dr. Michael_L_Alexander@Baylor.edu if interested in registering. Auditions for Bands and Orchestras (in-person) Baylor Symphony (MUEN 1101-01), Wind Ensemble (MUEN 1108), Symphonic Band (MUEN 1103), and Jazz Ensemble (MUEN 1106) auditions take place during Welcome Week in August. The audition repertoire will be posted on our website mid-July.
