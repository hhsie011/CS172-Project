The biggest updates to the user experience on ULink were done for UofL students. You'll notice an increased functionality and a more mobile-responsive interface. We've categorized everything into tiles so that access to information and necessary action items are grouped by subject heading. All UofL offices that support student services, administrative operations or academic information have worked incredibly hard to help us improve how you navigate and do transactions. There are ten Student tiles – Manage Classes (registration, schedules, planners), Academic Records (grades, transcripts, certificates), Financial Aid (awards, offers, plans), Financial Accounts (balances, payments, information), Tasks/Holds (to-do lists), Academic Progress (advising, reports), Profile (personal information), Graduation (apply, information), Admissions (undergrad/grad/transfer information), and Resources (important links).
