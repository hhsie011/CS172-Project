We provide support for students with documented disabilities by promoting equal access to all programs and services. DRC Online Portal Student Portal Instructor Portal Submit Service Requests New Students If you are a new student to the Disability Resource Center, please see our Getting Started Checklist for guidance on how to connect with our office. You will submit your first Service Request Form during your intake appointment with your coordinator. These meetings can be conducted via video call, phone, or in-person, and generally occur sometime after students have registered for classes, but hopefully before the priority deadline of August 5th for the Fall 2022 semester. Returning Students Once you have registered for your courses, we encourage you to submit your Service Request Form as soon as possible. The priority deadlines for the summer terms are 2 weeks prior to the start of each term. The priority deadline for the Fall 2022 semester is August 5th. Requests may be submitted after the priority deadline, but note takers will not be solicited in advance and there may be delays in preparing your letters and implementing your accommodations. Students who need to request books in alternate format should also submit an Alt Text Request. If you need any additional accommodations, including accommodations in a practicum or internship setting, please contact your coordinator as soon as possible to discuss your needs. Peer Academic Coaching Interested in additional support with time management, organization, etc.? Consider applying to the DRC's Cardinal Success Coach Program! Participating students meet regularly with another UofL student to help them stay organized, access resources, and more. Learn more and apply on the Cardinal Success Coach Program webpage.
