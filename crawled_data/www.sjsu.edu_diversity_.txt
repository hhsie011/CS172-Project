The Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion [ODEI] is dedicated to the standards of inclusive excellence, which view San Jose State's mission of academic excellence as inseparable from our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. The ODEI works to create a campus community that is free from discrimination and free from systemic and cultural barriers to academic and professional success for all of its students, faculty, staff and administrators. The ODEI envisions a campus where its members engage in robust intergroup dialogue, and collaboration across groups, divisions and silos. Derrick Liu/sv-dsa.org-CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Working to Combat Systemic Racism at SJSU Though we are proud to be one of the most diverse campus communities in the nation, action is needed more than ever to address systemic racism at San José State University. And action is what we are taking. The President’s Leadership team on Equity and Justice is facilitating and coordinating the university’s initiatives on racial equity and justice. This leadership team is charged with understanding the initiatives being generated on campus and the tracking of the follow-through in achieving the goals of those initiatives. Learn about SJSU’s immediate steps—as well as intermediate and long-term plans—to create permanent organizational change with regard to systemic racism on our campus. COVID-19 and Anti-Asian Bias COVID-19 and Anti-Asian Bias Anti-immigrant sentiment, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, and other forms of bias have always been with us. The current pandemic has seen an exponential rise in anti-Asian discrimination and milder microaggressions. We recognize the horrific disparities in higher morbidity and infection rates for Black/African Americans, Native Americans, and Latinx peoples from COVID-19 across the country. These collective realities have a great impact on the climate, organizational identity, and retention of employees. Crafted within the complex cultural and political contexts of the Bay Area, this webinar will (1) introduce historical and social psychological frameworks for organizational leaders and team members to understand the dynamics of COVID-19 xenophobia and bias, and (2) offer research-informed interventions and strategies to address anti-Asian bias incidents when they occur in the context of crisis. Target participants span from team members to people who hold positions of leadership in their organizations. Watch this webinar Engaged Inclusive Campus Through its leadership and work, the ODEI encourages civic and communal responsibility for diversity, equity and inclusion amongst its students, faculty, staff and administrators. The ODEI seeks to build organizational capacity to support and grow meaningful and collaborative working relations to provide opportunities for all members of our campus community to further their education and development as lifelong learners within their arena of work or schooling.
