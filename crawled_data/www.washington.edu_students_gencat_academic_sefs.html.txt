It also provides a knowledge base to answer critical questions about how individual organisms and biotic systems respond to perturbations and stresses imposed by human activities, as well as how the environment affects human behavior and institutions. This knowledge enables the design of methods for the conservation, restoration, and sustainable use of biotic systems, and is critical for environmental decision making. The goal of the bioresource science and engineering curriculum is to provide students with the training, tools, and experiences needed to be successful professionals in the paper and allied industries. At the same time, it provides a comprehensive education so graduates can effectively work and live in the world's complex society. The goal of the environmental science and terrestrial resource management curriculum is to present fundamental knowledge and problem-solving experiences that enable students to understand the interdisciplinary dimensions of natural resource and environmental sciences and management. The structure of this curriculum provides great flexibility for students to pursue specialized fields through the formal program options, which include: landscape ecology and conservation; restoration ecology and environmental horticulture; sustainable forest management; and wildlife conservation; or to construct individual coursework to fit their educational goals. Career opportunities abound in the area of environmental science and terrestrial resource management in both private and public sectors. One example is the projected need in the U.S. Forest Service, where it is estimated that one-third of the workforce will be retiring within the next five years. Instructional and Research Facilities: See the main school page for details. Honors Options Available: With College Honors (Completion of Honors Core Curriculum and Departmental Honors). With Honors (Completion of Departmental Honors requirements in the major). Contact adviser for requirements or visit the department webiste. Research, Internships, and Service Learning: The Office of Student and Academic Services regularly receives internship announcements, which are forwarded to all SEFS students via email and placed in the office's Career Corner. Students are strongly encouraged to pursue these opportunities, which include work experience with federal, state, and private organizations in environmental science, forestry, engineering, conservation, wildlife, horticulture, and other related fields. Undergraduate research opportunities are available. Students should contact faculty members in their areas of interest. There are also foreign study and field opportunities within the College. Some are formal study with faculty members, others are through other agencies. Contact the Office of Student and Academic Services for more information. Department Scholarships: For majors, the School of Environmental and Forest Sciences has a strong scholarship program that provides in-state tuition to students, based on merit or need. Please refer to the department website for application information. The Washington Pulp and Paper Foundation provides scholarships for students enrolled in the bioresource science and engineering curriculum. For information, contact Professor Rick Gustafson in Bloedel 364 or visit the foundation website. Student Organizations/Associations: The School has student organizations which organize student symposia, field trips, parties, slide shows and talks, public service projects, and other social activities. Please refer to the department website for current SEFS student organizations. Of Special Note: Some classes include field trips or require laboratory supplies or material duplication at student expense.
