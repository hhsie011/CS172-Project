It’s a remedies-based resolution option. Adaptable resolution is an alternative resolution pathway to the disciplinary process. It does not involve an investigation or imposition of sanctions. Adaptable resolution focuses more on directly addressing the harmed party’s needs and desired outcomes. It’s voluntary. Both parties must agree to participate for the process to move forward. Either party can also choose to end the process. If adaptable resolution ends, other options, including disciplinary resolution, could be considered. It’s not disciplinary. It doesn’t involve an investigation, adjudication, or imposition of sanctions. It may involve taking responsibility for the harm caused. It may also include agreement to participate in appropriate and reasonable remedies. These remedies could be similar to measures imposed as disciplinary sanctions, but they are always determined through mutual agreement. The structure is flexible. Adaptable resolution is a highly customized approach as each person’s needs differ. What are my options for Adaptable Resolution? Adaptable resolution may include, but is not limited to, the following approaches: Restorative Justice Conference or Circle: Format: structured and facilitated conversation between participants Participants: complainant, respondent, and/or other community members Goal: to acknowledge harm, share perspectives, and create a mutually agreed-upon resolution that addresses the harmed party’s needs, holds the responsible party accountable, prevents further harmful behavior, and seeks to restore the community’s trust in the responsible party A circle may include multiple members of the community to explore individual and community impact, harm, and opportunities for repair. Facilitated Conversation: Format: structured and facilitated conversation between participants Participants: complainant, respondent, and/or other community members Goal: perspective-sharing and/or working towards an agreed-upon resolution Shuttle Communication Format: structured and facilitated conversation done independently with parties, direct interaction between parties is not required Participants: complainant and respondent Goal: perspective-sharing and/or working towards an agreed-upon resolution Policy & Procedures SIM/Title IX Policies Adaptable Resolution Federal Guidelines Key Points Amnesty Definitions Retaliation Confidentiality & Privacy Responsible Employee SB212 Reporting Title IX Baylor University does not discriminate on the basis of sex or gender in any of its education or employment programs and activities, and it does not tolerate discrimination or harassment on the basis of sex or gender.
