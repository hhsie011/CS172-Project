Incoming and current students have several financial aid options at Stanford. Review the resources below to better understand the admission and aid opportunities available to you. undergraduate | co-term | graduate Admission Undergraduates: If you’re an incoming undergraduate, apply directly to the university. Coterms: Coterminal programs allow Stanford students to complete their bachelor’s and master’s degrees in parallel. Undergraduates apply directly to a department to enroll in a coterm program. Graduate students: Prospective graduate students are evaluated and admitted by each program. Apply directly to your department (requirements, deadlines and contacts may vary). undergraduate | co-term | graduate Financial aid What financial aid looks like Stanford offers financial assistance for students at all parts of their academic journey — from incoming first-year students to those looking to continue their education in engineering. Undergraduate financial aid Co-term financial aid Graduate financial aid Students share their stories “Looking back, I’m so glad I didn’t let the cost of Stanford stop me from applying. If I could give just one piece of advice to those unsure of whether or not they’d be able to pay for a Stanford education, take the time to familiarize yourself with the financial aid programs before making the decision not to apply because of cost.” Jorge’s story Print Stanford ENGINEERING Web Login Address 475 Via Ortega Stanford, CA 94305 United States Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Youtube Instagram Stanford Engineering Magazine Events Departments Open Faculty Positions Open Staff Positions Intranet Give Visit Contact Us Sign up for our email Your source for engineering research and ideas Research & Ideas email Stanford University Stanford Home(link is external) Maps & Directions(link is external) Search Stanford(link is external) Emergency Info(link is external) Terms of Use(link is external) Privacy(link is external) Copyright(link is external) Trademarks(link is external) Non-Discrimination(link is external) Accessibility(link is external) © Stanford University.
