Featuring Dr. Karen Blair, Trent University, Ontario, Canada "I Wanna Hold Your Hand - But - Is It Safe? Experiences of Public Affection Sharing in Same-Sex Versus Mixed-Sex Relationship" Affection sharing is one of our most basic forms of human communication. The hand on the small of a back, a head leaning on a shoulder, a hug, or a squeeze around the knuckles can communicate support, love, compassion and so much more, but not everyone feels equally free to share such forms of affection with their partner in front of onlookers. While everyone varies in their personal preferences and levels of comfort when it comes to PDAs (Public Displays of Affection), individuals in socially marginalized relationships often feel that even the most mundane forms of affection sharing are â€˜off-limits' due to the potential for unwanted consequences. Indeed, although civil rights for LGBTQ individuals have been steadily increasing over the last two decades, in many jurisdictions, anti-LGBTQ hate crimes have also been increasing. Anti-LGBTQ hate crimes are more likely to be violent than other forms of hate crimes and are not infrequently precipitated by some form of affection sharing between members of a same-sex or gender-diverse couple. While the media is replete with such stories, in this talk I will explore empirical data collected that demonstrates the toll that social prejudices can take on the ability of those in same-sex and gender-diverse relationships to share the simplest of affections with each other while in public. While the notion of holding hands in public may, for some, seem like a rather inconsequential activity that one can either take or leave according to their own personal preferences, the ability to view affection sharing as a personal preference rather than a socially-regulated and controlled behavior belies the true experiences of many for whom the very thought of sharing affection in public leads to vigilance and concerns for safety. Special Performance by Guest Artist and Slam Poet, Regie Cabico. Tuesday, October 12 Tie Dye Versity Organized by Risk Intervention & Safety Education (RISE) Red Raider Plaza 11:00 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. IGNITE! Texas Tech's Program for LGBTQIA Allyship "Femmephobia 101: Exploring and Challenging Rules, Norms and Assumptions About Femininity" Zoom 2:00 - 3:15 p.m. Register for IGNITE! Femmephobia 101 Featuring Dr. Karen Blair, Trent University, Dr. Rhea Ashley Hoskin, University of Waterloo, and Dr. Jocelyne Bartram Scott, Bucknell University What comes to mind when you think of femininity? When you meet a feminine person, what assumptions do you make about them? What assumptions do you feel others make about your own femininity? Have you ever tried to distance yourself from feminine traits or people? In this workshop participants will learn to identify the norms, rules, and assumptions surrounding femininity as well as who is impacted by them. By considering whose femininity is societally acceptable and the limits of femininity's acceptability, workshop attendees will build a collective understanding of femme and feminine-of-center experiences as well as the broader impact of femmephobia. We will discuss the role and impact of femmephobia in our daily lives as well as brainstorm how we can interrupt femmephobia in ourselves and others through everyday interventions. Ultimately, participants will develop an understanding of the relationship between patriarchy, the gender binary, and femmephobia. Together, workshop attendees will learn the importance of disrupting femmephobia to meet intersectional social justice agendas, particularly those aimed at improving sexuality and gender identity equity and inclusion.
