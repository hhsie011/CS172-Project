Academic merit scholarship eligibility is determined when a student is admitted to the University. To apply for admission to University of Miami, go to the Office of Admissions website. All other need-based financial aid is awarded by the Office of Financial Assistance Services upon receipt of a processed Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). For more information about how to apply, visit the Office of Student Financial Assistance Services online or in-person at their offices, on the second floor of the Whitten University Center. Undergraduate Scholarships Undergraduate Endowed Departmental Scholarships are part of the financial aid awarding process.

Graduate Tuition-Based Scholarship Support The School of Architecture provides non-need based tuition scholarships to graduate students.

While receiving a tuition scholarship, a graduate student is expected to: Maintain adequate and continuous progress in her or his program of study; Maintain a record that is largely free of grades of incomplete and/or that fall below the Graduate School’s and program’s minimum-grade requirements; Maintain a cumulative Grade Point Average that is at or above 3.0; Be continuously enrolled. All forms of U-SoA-provided tuition scholarships are limited to: The normal duration of the program and track, regardless a student’s time to completion; Only those courses that appear on a student’s approved program of study; specifically, tuition-based scholarships may not be used to: Retake courses (or take substitutes) regardless the reason, including but not limited to courses that are dropped after the final day for 100% refund, courses for which a grade on incomplete (I) was not removed within the one-year limit for its removal, courses for which a student earned a final grade that is below the UM Graduate School minimum acceptable grade (currently, a grade of C is the minimum acceptable grade a student may earn); Take courses that students are required to enroll in after they have completed their programs of study but have not yet graduated; specifically. Other Financial Aid may be available through Graduate Professional Financial Assistance.
