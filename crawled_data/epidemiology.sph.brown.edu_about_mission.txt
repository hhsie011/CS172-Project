The primary mission of the Department of Epidemiology is to pursue excellence in research, scholarship, teaching, training and service within the field of epidemiology. We have 21 primary faculty and more than 30 affiliated faculty who work on health outcomes on diverse populations throughout the life course, from early pregnancy to end of life. Our faculty are world-renowned researchers whose expertise include cancer, environmental health, global health, mental health, infectious disease, maternal and child health, molecular, health disparities, obesity, substance use, mindfulness, and epidemiologic methods. Our department consists of faculty engaged in full time research and teaching, as well as importantly clinical faculty and faculty members jointly appointed with Brown University and the Rhode Island Health Department. The department is committed to fostering excellence in the next generation of epidemiologists. Across the department, our renowned faculty teach epidemiology driven courses to undergraduate and graduate students and provide critical mentorship to students as part of their training.

The department is also multidisciplinary and cross collaborative. We work with faculty in social sciences, basic biomedical sciences, and clinical departments at Alpert Medical School and its seven affiliated hospitals (e.g., Cardiology, Endocrinology, Obstetrics/Gynecology, Pediatrics, and Psychiatry). Members of our department are competitive and frequently successful in securing grants. We have high rates of F31 funding from NIH, with more than half of submitted grants being funded compared to the average of 27.8% across NIH institutes. Currently, we have over 130 active grants and each year more than 100 proposals are submitted. Our scholarship frequently takes us out of the classroom and into communities we work with; whether that is here in Rhode Island, or globally. Faculty and students collaborate with community members to inform research practices, conduct research and advocate for better evidence-based health policy based on findings."
