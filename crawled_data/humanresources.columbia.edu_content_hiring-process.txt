Template-Based Hires (TBH) is a function within People @ Columbia where new hire and rehire transactions are initiated electronically in the departments and schools through templates. Reminder Notice New York's Local Law 67 prohibits employers in New York City from inquiring about or relying on an applicant's salary history during the hiring process. See Presentation: Salary History Inquiries (NYC Local Law 67) Expand all Collapse all Academic & Administrative Hiring Background Checks & Drug Screenings In support of a safe and secure campus community, any applicant for a University position who receives a conditional offer of employment will undergo a background check. Rehires with a break in service of more than six consecutive months will also be required to undergo a background check. A background check consists of a criminal record search (including the 50-state sex offender registry), education and employment verifications. For more information, please see Background Checks. Drug Screenings: Some applicants will also be required to undergo drug testing, motor vehicle search or fingerprinting, depending on the nature of the position. Applicants for such positions will be notified of this requirement when an offer of employment is made. The finalist must be cleared by your HR client manager and given a conditional offer of employment before a background check can be initiated. Applicants are not permitted to begin working until the background check clearance is issued, unless an exception is approved in advance by the VP of Human Resources or his or her designee. Key Actions The finalist is selected by the school/department and cleared by your HR client manager. A conditional offer of employment is made. The Department initiates the background check (via e-link or manually). CUHR or CUIMC HR reviews the report and notifies the school/department if the selected finalist has cleared the background check or the report revealed a potentially disqualifying alert. In the case of a potentially disqualifying alert, CUHR / CUIMC HR will initiate the adverse action process (see Background Check Guidelines for more information regarding the pre-adverse process). If the finalist is cleared by CUHR or CUMC HR, the school/department can move forward with the hiring process. See Columbia University Background Check Policy Note: For more information regarding which positions require drug testing, motor vehicle department search, or finger printing, contact your designated HR Client Manager. Template-Based Hires and Rehires in PAC Template-Based Hires (TBH) is a function within People @ Columbia where new hire and rehire transactions are initiated electronically in the departments and schools through templates. A document attachment feature allows you to attach any documents necessary, and the electronic workflow allows for a paperless approval process. This function also integrates Salary Distributions and Additional Compensation payments known at the time of hire into the templates. This functionality ensures that monies are charged to the correct funding arrangement and not to suspense. Access to Template-Based Hires is provided to employees at Columbia University who initiate and approve hiring transactions. The Human Resources Processing Center (HRPC) completes the hire/rehire transactions and creates the PAC record. There is a campus specific template to use depending on the type of employee you are hiring or rehiring: Hire-Academic: to hire academic officers (Morningside campus). Rehire-Academic: to rehire academic officers (Morningside campus). Hire-Clinical: to hire academic officers (CUIMC campus). Used for academic officers who hold a clinical appointment and also for those who do not. Rehire-Clinical: to rehire academic officers (CUIMC campus).
