Continue reading for guidelines about filming, parking on campus or finding sources. Parking and Directions Everyone who parks on Florida State’s campus must display a valid parking permit. News media are required to display a special “media” parking pass, which may be picked up at Transportation and Parking Services before arriving on campus. Marked television trucks are not required to carry the “media” decal, as their vehicle is considered a valid permit. Media can park in any lot on campus, excluding fire lanes, handicapped spaces and 24-hour reserved parking spots. Permits picked up at the Transportation and Parking Services office must be returned upon leaving campus. For pick-up and return, they are located at University Center Building C-5406. Directions to Florida State’s main campus are available at Visitor Services. Public Records Requests The state of Florida has the broadest public records and open meeting laws in the country. Since Florida State University is a public university, most of the activities and materials of our work fall under Florida’s “sunshine” laws. All news media requests for public records should be directed to https://generalcounsel.fsu.edu/public-records. There are some exceptions to the public records laws. Proprietary information regarding research, patents and licensing is exempt. Donors who choose to remain anonymous have the right to do so. Student information, other than that considered “directory” information, may not be disclosed. Social Security numbers and some employee evaluative material are also exempt from the public records law. Contact Interim Assistant Vice President Dennis Schnittker with questions. Reporting and Filming on Campus News Crews: Florida State welcomes news media to its public campus. Most exterior areas are accessible to reporters and photographers. All members of the media, however, are encouraged to contact Tim Fordyce in University Communications at (850) 644-2466 prior to filming or photographing on campus. Access may be denied or limited during an emergency or other situations when unrestricted media access may become disruptive. See parking guidelines and directions. University Communications’ Digital Media Team and Photography Services can provide high-quality B-roll and photographs of the campus to media. Call (850) 644-4030 for assistance. Prior clearance is required to conduct interviews, film or photograph inside campus buildings, residence halls and classrooms, or any other area that is restricted. Please call (850) 644-2466 for a location agreement from News and Research Communications staff. Commercial Crews: Commercial crews are not permitted to film on campus. Photo/Video Requests Photos: University Communications’ Photography Services will assist in filling photography needs for campus departments and organizations.
