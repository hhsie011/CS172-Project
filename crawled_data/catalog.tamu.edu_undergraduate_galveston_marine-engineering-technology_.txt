The Marine Engineering Technology Department offers programs that prepare students to become leaders in the maritime industry. Within this context, the Marine Engineering Technology (MARR) program produces graduates who are prepared to perform engineering work in the maritime sector onboard a vessel or marine-related shore-based industries involving the design, production, operation, maintenance, and management of engineering and power generation systems. The program is available in a License Option version as part of the Texas A&M Maritime Academy for students who want to serve as an engineering officer aboard seagoing vessels. Opportunities for such work abound in the vicinity of the campus, which is located just south of the fourth largest metropolis in the United States. The Houston/Galveston area has extensive port facilities, considerable commercial, recreational, and military ship traffic, and offshore and onshore infrastructure associated with the oil industry. Career opportunities of various kinds are therefore available for these graduates who are ideally suited for working on ships, at port facilities, and at shore facilities, particularly in power generation, distribution, and associated auxiliary support systems. Our goal is to produce graduates with a strong background in engineering fundamentals, mathematics, and analytical methods, which is reinforced by practical machine shop, welding, and laboratory experiences (including several on the training ship). The curriculum builds on a foundation of basic engineering topics such as fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, electricity, drafting, and materials science to develop inter-disciplinary skills required for the practice of marine engineering. In particular, the program’s educational objectives are to produce graduates who can plan, design, construct, operate, and maintain systems used in marine, offshore and onshore power systems such as propulsion, electrical power generation and distribution, refrigeration, and potable water production and sterilization. Graduates also support the maritime sector (the Navy and Coast Guard), companies operating sea-going vessels, the offshore oil and gas industry; and, are well-prepared to engage in lifelong education, professional development, and continuous improvement.
