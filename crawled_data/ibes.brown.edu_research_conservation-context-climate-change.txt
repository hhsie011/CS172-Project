Soon, many of the species on Earth will be “climate refugees”, no longer able to survive within their historic/native ranges. Likewise, many of the human-wildlife conflicts that currently exist will be exacerbated by climate change, while the very ecosystems that all species depend on will be threatened.

Soon, many of the species on Earth will be “climate refugees”, no longer able to survive within their historic/native ranges. Likewise, many of the human-wildlife conflicts that currently exist will be exacerbated by climate change, while the very ecosystems that all species depend on will be threatened. How we save these species and systems isn’t just a biological question; it’s an ethical, economic and social question as well. At IBES, we’re leveraging our world-class strength in environmental social science along with our leaders in conservation biology to evaluate and develop strategies that will save species from extinction, reduce human-wildlife conflicts and restore native ecosystems. Projects Saving Climate Refugee Species Climate change is expected to endanger tens of thousands of species by the end of this century. This will occur because many species can only tolerate particular climate conditions, those conditions will no longer exist where those species are currently found, and many species will be blocked from shifting their geographic distribution by highways, urban sprawl and agricultural landscapes. Solutions for Wildlife and Humans on African Plains Some of the biggest challenges for promoting wildlife conservation and advancing human livelihoods involve making sure that people, their livestock, and the wildlife that live alongside them each have enough to eat. Reforesting Brazil’s Atlantic Rainforest Over the last 500 years, logging, agriculture, and population growth have decimated Brazil’s Atlantic rainforest, an ecosystem that once spanned 1000 miles of coastline and hosted unparalleled biodiversity. Many plants and animals native to the forest are now on the brink of extinction, and small farmers living in the midst of the largest remaining forest fragments have few options for rural socioeconomic development. News News from Brown World’s island conifers threatened with extinction from climate change July 15, 2019 By estimating climate conditions in which conifer species could thrive if they needed to, a new study identifies which species are at extinction risk due to climate change. Read Article Open details for World’s island conifers threatened with extinction from climate change News from IBES How to Save a Species: Guiding conservation in the face of a changing climate September 20, 2016 One hundred years from now, our planet is likely to be a very different place. Earth's climate is already changing, threatening vulnerable ecosystems the world over. Many scientists consider a major global extinction event to be all but inevitable within the next century.
