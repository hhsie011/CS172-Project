Texas A&M uses the Code Maroon emergency notification system to alert the campus community of possible emergency situations. What is Code Maroon? Code Maroon is Texas A&M's emergency notification system. How will I be notified? Code Maroon uses multiple notification methods to reach the campus community. For example, alerts are sent via text message, Texas A&M Email (Neo), KAMU-FM radio, campus cable television, Emergency Alert System (EAS) radios, computer alerts, classroom alerts, Twitter, and RSS. How can I prepare? An emergency is an unexpected serious situation demanding immediate action. There are many different types of emergencies that we may experience at Texas A&M, due to our size and location. However, there are several resources to help members of the campus community be better prepared for the unexpected, such as the 12th Man Emergency Playbook, or the Emergency Procedures webpage. How do I receive Code Maroon notification if I'm a parent or a friend of the school? Anyone can receive alerts by subscribing to the Code Maroon RSS feed or following "@TAMUCodeMaroon" on Twitter. For more information, visit the Code Maroon site. Why do I receive Code Maroon before/after my friends? Code Maroon messages are sent to cell phone carriers within minutes. The cell phone carriers then distribute the message per their individual priorities and protocols which are not controlled by the university. If I am away from my phone, how will I know if a Code Maroon has been issued? Text messages are only one way Code Maroon messages are sent. Other methods include email (Neo account), classroom speakers, desktop pop-ups, KAMU-FM radio, campus cable television, and emergency alert system (EAS) radios located in buildings across the campus. If a Code Maroon is issued, how will I know what to do or where to go? Code Maroon messages are short and concise, due to the limited number of characters that may be sent via SMS text message (maximum 140 characters). In the event of an emergency, please refer to the Texas A&M Emergency webpage for additional details and information. What do I do if I live on campus and the campus is evacuated? In the event campus is evacuated for an extended period of time, follow the emergency instructions posted on the Texas A&M Emergency webpage directing you to safe locations within the community. Detailed information about where to go will be provided via the Texas A&M Emergency webpage at the time of the emergency. What do I do if I live off campus? In event there is a Code Maroon issued and you are off campus, check the Texas A&M Emergency website, stay alert for Code Maroons, monitor local media outlets, and avoid the immediate area of the incident. Who do I contact about developing a building/department specific Evacuation Plan or Continuity of Operations Plan? For assistance with Building Evacuation Plans or Continuity of Operations Plans, please contact Fire & Life Safety or the Office of Safety & Security.
