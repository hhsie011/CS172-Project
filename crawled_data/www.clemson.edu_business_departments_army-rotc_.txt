Military Leadership Clemson Army ROTC Fightin' Tiger Battalion "This we'll defend." The Clemson Corps of Cadets is founded on deep and rich military traditions. Our goal is to prepare cadets with the tools, training and experiences that will help them succeed in any competitive environment. Cadets will have a normal college student experience like everyone else on campus, but when they graduate, some will become officers in the Army. Officers are problem-solvers and planners. They are driven to achieve success with their team on every mission. Are you interested in gaining experience you can't find anywhere else?
