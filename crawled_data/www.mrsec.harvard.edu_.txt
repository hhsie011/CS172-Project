Fun video: Printing of the Harvard MRSEC logo in 3D two-color wax and two-color silicone. The Harvard Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) supports world-class research, education, and outreach activities (flyer) at the forefront of soft matter science through the auspices of the National Science Foundation. Our two Interdisciplinary Research Groups (IRGs) seek to create new classes of soft functional materials and to provide new insights into the behavior of mechanically soft systems far from equilibrium. An important mission of the Center is to train and retain a diverse generation of students in materials science and engineering by cultivating innovation and entrepreneurship in our students, postdocs, and the whole community. By forging new scientific directions, the Center focuses on unraveling complex phenomena in soft materials with the goal of translating these advances to benefit society.
