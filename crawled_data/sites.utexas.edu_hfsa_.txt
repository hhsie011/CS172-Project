We were recognized for our wide range of programs and measures, from our efforts to recruit, support and graduate our students on time to supporting specific programs from the arts and humanities to engineering, business, medicine and the sciences. This qualifies UT Austin for consideration as a Hispanic-Serving Institution!” It is a major milestone well earned by everyone’s contribution & commitment to seeing our Latin@ students succeed!
