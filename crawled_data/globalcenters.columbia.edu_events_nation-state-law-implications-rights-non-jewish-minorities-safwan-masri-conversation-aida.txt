Safwan Masri in conversation with Aida Touma-Sliman Events Past Event The Nation State Law: Implications for the Rights of Non-Jewish Minorities - Safwan Masri in conversation with Aida Touma-Sliman Share Add to Calendar: Google Yahoo January 20, 2019 6:30 PM - 8:00 PM Columbia Global Centers | Amman In this conversation, Aida Touma-Sliman will discuss the Knesset’s recent legislation, which stipulates that "the realization of the right to national self-determination in Israel is unique to the Jewish people." The bill, passed in July 2018, creates second-class citizenship for non-Jewish minorities living in Israel and disregards the rights of its Palestinian citizens. Touma-Sliman will delve into the ramifications of such legislation on the lived realities of non-Jewish minorities in Israel, as well as on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Aida Touma-Sliman is a member of the Knesset representing Hadash (Democratic Front for Peace and Equality) in the Joint List. She served as the editor-in-chief of Al-Ittihad, the only Arabic daily newspaper in Israel, from 2011-2014. Touma-Sliman is a prominent feminist activist and founder of the Women Against Violence Association. She is the first woman elected to the Higher Monitoring Committee for Arab Citizens in Israel, and is the co-founder of the International Women Commission for Just Palestinian-Israeli Peace. Touma-Sliman was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.
