Environmental scientists at Harvard address environmental issues such as global warming, stratospheric ozone depletion, and local and regional air and water pollution. This work requires perspectives from a diverse set of scientific disciplines including atmospheric physics and chemistry, oceanography, glaciology, hydrology, geophysics, ecology, and biogeochemistry. We view the earth's systems as a complex set of chemical, physical and biological interactions, made even more complicated by the various activities of human society. Through exploration of the underlying processes and feedbacks within the Earth system, and with a range of approaches from theory and modeling to experiments and observations, we train undergraduate and graduate students to think about environmental processes in an integrated fashion, preparing them to manage the environmental challenges we face. Research is strongly interdisciplinary, with many connections to Earth and Planetary Sciences and other science and policy programs at Harvard.
