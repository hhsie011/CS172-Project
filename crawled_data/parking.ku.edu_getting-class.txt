Moving your car from one parking lot to another between classes is not practical and contributes to traffic congestion. Walking To help you plan how much walking time you should allow to get to your class, we've timed trips from some Yellow lots to key campus locations. Walking Routes and Times FROM TO ROUTE TIME Lot 90 Wescoe Map 11 min. Lot 125 Wescoe Map 12 min. Lot 59 JRP Map 7 min. Lot 60 Wescoe Map 8 min. Lot 94 Fraser Map 11 min. Lot 301 Wescoe Map (via bus route #41) 20 min. Contact KU Parking for more suggestions on where to park for easy access to particular buildings. Bus Service You can ride any bus on on campus for free, and by showing your KU Card when riding off campus. A bus is available at nearly any campus bus stop every 5-10 minutes. Route 42 circulates throughout campus, including lots to 90, 59, 60, 94 and 125. Additional Routes circulate on main campus as well, including to residence halls, West Campus and the Park & Ride lots. Biking + Bus All buses in Lawrence are equipped with bike racks that can hold up to two bikes. Racks are available on a first-come, first-served basis. There are a few things to be aware of when taking your bike on the bus: If there are no bikes in the rack, you should place your bike in the slot closest to the bus. To lower the rack, squeeze the handle and pull it down. After placing your bike in the rack, raise the support arm over the front tire to secure it. Remember to remind the driver that you will be removing your bike when you get off the bus.
