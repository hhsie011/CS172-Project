Contact UW-IT About UW-IT Getting Started: Windows Domains Background The Microsoft Infrastructure service does not provide departmental Windows domains; we provide delegated OUs in the NETID domain and encourage their use. We can provide consulting on Windows domains and domain controllers, as necessary. The following Windows domain oriented documentation is provided under ‘Other IT Services and Help’ as an IT service we don’t directly provide, but which we maintain to facilitate Windows domain services at the UW. There are a diversity of Windows domains at the UW, with about 200 Windows domains noted during a network scan in 2007. As of 2016, some departments run their own Windows forest, and the majority of these Windows domains have a trust with the Netid.washington.edu domain, to provide UW NetID based authentication services and authorization integration with the UW Groups Service. Most departments have a delegated OUs in the NETID domain and have migrated away from their departmental Windows domain. UW-IT recommends that you not setup your own Windows domain, but instead leverage a delegated OU in the NETID domain. We provide tight integration, business continuity (including geo-redundancy), and a variety of other benefits.
