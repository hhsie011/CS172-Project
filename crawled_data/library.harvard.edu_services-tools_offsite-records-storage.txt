Learn how to set up an account with Records Management Services and work with the Archives to arrange for storage at the Harvard Depository. Getting Started If you need a place to store University records you're required to retain, we can help. The Records Management Services team at the Harvard University Archives can arrange for storage of your University records at the Harvard Depository. The first step to getting your records moved to the Harvard Depository is to request an account with Records Management Services. To apply for an account, complete the records center contract (PDF) and email it to archives_rms@harvard.edu. Once the office account is created, those who have been designated as authorized users will be able to use the account. Contact archives_rms@harvard.edu to update the users when needed. Identifying Records for Deposit You can identify records eligible for storage using the General Records Schedule (GRS). The GRS covers common records found throughout the University. Most entries in the GRS direct you to retain records for a specific number of years, after which they can be destroyed. If this is your first time using the GRS or if you would like a refresher, visit our Records Schedule Basics page. Preparing Records for Deposit 1. Requesting Boxes and Barcodes To order boxes and barcodes, fill out this supply request form. Box and barcode requests are linked to your office's offsite storage account. If you don't already have an account, see "Getting Started" for details on applying for your account. 2. Pack, Label and Barcode Your Boxes Records that are stored offsite must be properly packed, barcoded and labeled in order to be transported to the Harvard Depository. This document (PDF) provides guidance on packing boxes and creating label templates. 3. Complete Paperwork You must create an inventory of the materials you're transferring offsite as well as get an authorization form signed by the head of your department.
