The K-12 channel features experts from across the Earth Institute presenting relevant sustainability content in short live sessions for K-12 students, families, and educators. Through these interactive sessions, available afterwards as recordings, we are bringing our interdisciplinary research from across our centers to students. Each session has a targeted age range based on the topic, and the sessions vary between topical lectures, demos, and skills-based training. Whenever possible, we also offer related educational resources.
