In a study of 375 adults who have successfully maintained weight loss and who do moderate- to vigorous-intensity workouts, most reported that they exercised at the same time of day, most often in the early morning. And regardless of what time people exercised, the Obesity study found that working out at a regular time was associated with higher physical activity levels. “Our findings warrant future experimental research to determine whether promoting consistency in the time of day that planned and structured physical activity is performed can help individuals achieve and sustain higher levels of physical activity,” says senior author Dale Bond, PhD, professor of psychiatry and human behavior (research). The Department of Health and Human Services’ exercise guidelines for adults advise a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week to see “substantial health benefits.” The study subjects were all participants in the National Weight Control Registry. The registry tracks adults who have lost more than 30 pounds and maintained it for more than one year to help researchers identify the practices that help people lose weight and keep it off. Leah Schumacher RES’19, PhD, the paper’s first author and a postdoctoral fellow in the Clinical Psychology Training Program, says in the future they’re hoping to study “whether there is a specific time of day that is more advantageous for individuals who have initial low physical activity levels to develop a physical activity habit.” daily exercise daily routines exercise exercise guidelines Fall 2019 Share.

Berkley said he remembered the feeling of excitement mixed with trepidation he felt at his own graduation 44 years ago: “I was… anxious about what awaited me beyond those doors,” he said. “Could I achieve my ambitious goals and make a difference? For me, a middle-class kid growing up in the projects, it was Brown that made me feel like I could.” He encouraged the graduates to fight for what they believed in, despite any criticism they may receive. As director of GAVI, The Vaccine Alliance, it's what he was determined to do as he continued to promote the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines even as disinformation about the vaccine spread across the United States.“Find what is right for you and do it,” he said. “We need you to become champions of the truth.” ...
