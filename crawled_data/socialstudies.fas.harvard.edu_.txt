For more than five decades it has brought together outstanding teachers and intellectually engaged students who share not only a fascination with social science research and theory but also concerns about pressing social, political, and economic problems facing contemporary societies. Members of the Committee are united in their belief that rigorous social science inquiry must cross disciplinary boundaries and that it should be based on an understanding of classic and contemporary social theory and on an intimate knowledge of the history and culture of the places we study.
