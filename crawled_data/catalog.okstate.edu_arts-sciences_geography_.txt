Certificates Faculty Geography brings together the study of people, the environment, and the interactions between them in order to understand and improve our world. Human geographers tend to focus on local, national, and global flows of ideas and practices. They may emphasize the study of migration, voting patterns, travel behavior within cities, or how the use of social media varies from one region to another, for example. Physical geographers seek to understand environmental processes that affect air and water quality, biodiversity, or contribute to natural disasters. Human-environment geographers work at the intersection of social and natural dynamics to study the climate impacts of human activities, to understand vulnerability to drought or other natural hazards, or to design and plan sustainable cities, for example. Through the use of Global Positioning System (GPS) data, drone- and satellite-based imagery, and geographic information systems (GIS), geographers, map, monitor, and analyze environmental change in order to understand how our world is changing, where, and who is affected. Geography spans the sciences, social sciences, and humanities. Much of the work that geographers do is inherently interdisciplinary in scope. If you are seeking a flexible major, want to help solve social and environmental challenges, enjoy traveling, are curious about different ways of life, like maps, are interested in global perspectives and issues, enjoy being outside, want to learn more about mapping or drones, or are interested in research, a geography major can open doors to a wide variety of career options. Undergraduates also have the opportunity to conduct in research with a faculty mentor, gain work experience through an internship, or participate in a study abroad. Many careers are available to the geography major. Recent graduates have been employed in the public and private sector in jobs involving urban and regional planning, GIS mapping and analysis for oil and gas projects, community development, locational analysis for business and industry, resource planning and management, the Foreign Service, cartography, and teaching. Geography also provides an excellent foundation for a liberal education and is a good basis for a career in business, industry or government. The department specializes in three areas: nature-society dynamics, including resource management; cultural and historical geography; and geographic information systems, including unmanned aerial systems. The department also manages Cartography Services, the Center for Applications of Remote Sensing, three GIS labs, a palynology/paleoecology laboratory, field mapping equipment such as Global Positioning System receivers, and an interactive weather analysis system with satellite data feed. The Department of Geography offers numerous flexible degree options including BA and BS degrees in Geography (with Business Essentials, Pre-Law, and Pre-Ministry options), the BA in Global Studies (with Business Essentials, Pre-Law, and Pre-Ministry options), and the BS in Geospatial Information Science. Undergraduates also have the opportunity to participate in an accelerated master’s program (“4+1” degree) in which they can earn the BA in Global Studies in four years and the MS in Global Studies in their fifth year. An advanced program leading to the MS and PhD degrees is also available. The department also sponsors students in the interdisciplinary MS and PhD programs in environmental science. Global Studies Global Studies combines the study of world regions with cultural, environmental, economic, political and other facets of globalization and global change. Global studies offers practical and vital knowledge about the world, how it works and why it is changing. Faculty in Geography who teach in the Global Studies program have extensive experience with research, teaching, study abroad, and travel around the world, with specialties in North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa, Australia, Central Asia and the Middle East. A Global Studies degree prepares students for both international and domestic careers with the federal government and a wide variety of NGOs, charitable organizations, and other agencies involved in different aspects of regional and global development. The ongoing growth and global expansion of Christian missions, many of which originate and are coordinated by Oklahoma-based churches and charities, will benefit from students with a degree in Global Studies. It is also an ideal second major for many other degree programs both within and beyond A&S (e.g. Foreign Languages, Political Science, International Business, International Agriculture). Students with a Global Studies degree can serve the needs of Oklahoma, the nation and the world by joining a workforce of globally-minded people who can easily function in a world that is increasingly interconnected. Geospatial Information Science Driven by technological innovations and an explosion in the availability of spatial information, geospatial technologies including geographic information systems (GIS), the Global Positioning System (GPS) and remote sensing have introduced revolutionary ways to utilize spatial information. The BS degree in geospatial information science (GISci) provides students with a theoretical and applied foundation in the rapidly growing field of GISci. The program is especially relevant to students interested in cultural and natural resource management, agriculture, planning and the environment. The importance of GISci is underscored by a growing number of jobs emphasizing or entirely focused on the storage, analysis and visualization of geospatial data. A student who earns the BS in Geospatial Information Science at OSU will be well-versed in general GISci knowledge and will have competency utilizing GISci hardware and software for the planning, development and maintenance of spatial and nonspatial databases. Most important, students who complete the BS will have higher order skills involving the analysis of geospatial data and will be capable of communicating findings with larger audiences. Requirements for the proposed BS have been designed to parallel skills needed by GISci professionals. Upon earning the BS, a student will be proficient in spatial data capture, data representation, spatial data analysis, GISci theory, and GISci project development and implementation. Students can expect to find occupations in a variety of fields in private industry, government, education and agriculture. Since the early 1990s the OSU Geography Department has distinguished itself in GISci instruction and research. In 1996 the Department launched the state’s first Certificate in Geographic Information Systems and in subsequent years has expanded GISci course offerings to address growing student interest and demand. The Department is well-known nationally and internationally for research involving the integration of GISci within farm-level decision-making, for scholarship involving human patterns and processes tied to cultural and historical landscapes and for research involving communications and transportation systems. Faculty in the Department have been highly successful in obtaining extramural support for GISci research and extension activities from organizations ranging from the National Science Foundation to the National Park Service, U.S. Department of State, Oklahoma Historical Society, and Oklahoma Department of Transportation. Faculty in the Department have also worked to improve STEM education in Oklahoma schools through projects such as a $1.2 million grant from the National Science Foundation that introduced GISci activities in 6th through 12th grade science classrooms. The Department’s international outreach efforts tied to geospatial technologies include a training partnership involving faculty and students in Vietnam and a multi-year project aimed at building Iraq’s GISci infrastructure. Certificate in Environmental Studies (EVST) The certificate is open to all undergraduate majors and is designed to fit within most four-year degree plans without the need for additional credit hours. The certificate is awarded upon completion of the bachelor’s degree and requires the completion of 17 credit hours. Lower-division requirements include one introductory course from the environmental sciences plus a two-hour course on global sustainability. Upper-division requirements include two core courses (Conservation of Natural Resources, American Environmental History), plus two others (six credit hours) from a wide variety of upper-division courses that emphasize human-environment interaction. Completion of the certificate indicates that a student has developed a knowledge base of environmental science combined with the study of human cultural interactions with the natural world from the perspectives of history, political science, art, psychology, philosophy, literature, economics, and other disciplines. The certificate is ideal for students whose interests span the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. ‪The undergraduate Certificate in Environmental Studies recognizes students who complete their degrees with a notable share of courses emphasizing the study of the natural environment and how societies interact with nature. Certificate in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) The certificate in GIS provides students with broad exposure to principles and applications of GIS. A student who has earned the certificate is well-versed in general GIS theory and has knowledge and/or practical exposure to the following: hardware and software used in GIS and spatial data collection, planning, design, and management of spatial and non-spatial databases, spatial analysis and/or GIS programming, and representation of data in both mapped and tabular form. Requirements for the certificate are designed to parallel skills needed by GIS professionals. Admission into the certificate program is open to anyone enrolled as an undergraduate student, graduate student or special student at OSU. To receive a certificate in GIS, a student must complete 15 hours of coursework in GIS and related topics and hold a bachelor's or more advanced degree from OSU or an accredited college.

These degree programs emphasize preparation for employment in positions which are enhanced by an ability to recognize and to interpret spatial distributions, and to analyze regions. Particular emphasis is placed on the applied aspects of geography, with many graduates employed by private business as well as city, regional, state and national planning agencies. Recipients of graduate degrees in geography have also gone on to a variety of successful careers in various fields, including retail store location analysis, city planning, environmental assessment, and university teaching and research. The Master of Science Degree Admission to the master's program in geography is granted to college graduates with superior academic records. An undergraduate geography major is not required. Majors from the social, physical, and behavioral sciences and from the humanities are encouraged to apply. Incoming graduate students must demonstrate competency in cultural geography, physical geography, statistics and cartography. If a student lacks these prerequisite skills, an additional course in each of these subjects is required. Two basic plans of study exist for the master's degree. One plan requires a minimum of 30 credit hours, including a thesis; the other is a 36-credit-hour non-thesis option. Plans of study can be developed to accommodate many interests. Major faculty interests span nature-society dynamics, including resource management and cultural and political ecology; cultural and historical geography, geographic information science and unmanned aerial systems; urban and transportation geography; and regional analysis and development. The Doctor of Philosophy Degree Admission to the PhD program is granted to students with superior records in their previous graduate study. A previous degree in geography is not required, but incoming students from other disciplines must demonstrate competency in cultural geography, physical geography, statistics and cartography. If a student lacks these prerequisite skills, an additional course in each of these subjects is required. A minimum of 60 hours of graduate credit beyond the master's degree is required for the PhD degree. These hours include core courses (13 hours), elective courses in geography (15 hours minimum), elective courses outside of geography (9 hours minimum), and dissertation hours (15 hours minimum). Each student chooses an individual doctoral committee that advises the student in the formulation of an approved plan of study for the degree. Students focus their studies in one of three department specialty areas: nature-society dynamics, cultural and historical geography, and geographic information science, including unmanned aerial systems. Candidates for the PhD in geography must demonstrate either: proficiency in one language other than English, reading knowledge of two languages other than English, proficiency in advanced quantitative methods, proficiency in advanced qualitative methods, or proficiency in a multi-skill track. To be advanced to doctoral candidacy, the student must demonstrate proficiency in three specialized subject areas within geography and related disciplines by passing written and oral comprehensive examinations. An important requirement for the PhD degree is the preparation and successful defense of a doctoral dissertation. The dissertation must demonstrate the candidate's ability to plan and complete independent, original research in geography.
