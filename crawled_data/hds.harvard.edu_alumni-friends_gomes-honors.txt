Gomes, STB ’68 Distinguished Alumni Honors The Alumni/Alumnae Council annually honor distinguished HDS alumni whose excellence in life, work, and service pays homage to the mission and values of Harvard Divinity School and Peter J. Gomes, STB ’68 through the Gomes Honors Awards. Each year, the council invites fellow graduates to nominate other alumni/alumnae to receive the award. The council then selects a small number of recipients whose work exemplifies profound courage, accomplishment, and compassion in their personal and/or professional lives, and dedication to constancy of service in our challenging and wounded world. Honorees are invited to campus for a celebration and discussions of their work and experience. In Spring 2021 the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic obliged the council to hold the celebration online, with a Zoom discussion among the recipients and fellow alumni/alumnae. Following the event, HDS recorded a podcast series, "Divinity Dialogues," of interviews with each of the recipients.
