Close Search / Information Technology @ TU / Project Management Project Management INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY About IT Applications IT Security Policies/Guidelines Hardware Requirements Support Services Project Management Notes from IT Archive University Initiatives Get Tech Help TU Portal Project Management helps facilitate the technology components of the projects that you initiate to fulfill your department’s goals. What is a Project? Projects are unique, temporary endeavors that have a defined scope that is conducted within a specific timeline. Projects accomplish a specific goal, usually to solve a business problem. They are unique in that they do not include repeating support or operational activities. IT Projects are a collaboration between IT and other university departments and MUST have a defined business owner who can identify the functional requirements and success factors. The business owner is responsible, along with IT, for the success of the project. Additionally, to be considered, projects must have the approval of the dean or officer who is the project sponsor. There are two main categories of IT projects: New functionality Examples: software application, service, or system of any type These projects often involve one or more of the following IT activities: review of technical requirements, installation, and configuration of a software and/or hardware system, integration of a system or service into the enterprise network, enterprise authentication, data feeds from enterprise systems (Colleague), installation and configuration of hardware. If you are thinking about or have identified a new application or service for your department, please include IT in the evaluation. Even if you have already identified the solution and it is funded, there are functional and technical issues to consider before you purchase the product. Change to an existing software application, system, program, report or service Examples: any software or system, software or hardware, that is established in production now but requires upgrade or functionality enhancements These projects could be changes required by the vendor such as upgrades or enhancements requested by the business owner. Changes include functionality upgrades to systems and services (hardware and software), including changes to code, logic, or architecture of an application or report. Criteria for IT Projects In addition to belonging to one of the two project categories, your project request must meet the following two criteria: Work requires more than 10 hours of IT resource time Cost > $2500 (not including IT staff resource time) Additionally, you must identify the project impact: Strategic alignment/Main goal of the project Student success Academic programs and quality Global education External profile Infrastructure Mission critical Business critical Project Request Procedure Information Technology has created a process for requesting IT resources and outlines the steps required for approval and scheduling of a project. All projects will be reviewed with an emphasis for data and system security. Please read the entire Project Request Procedure. Make a Request If your request meets the project criteria, then complete the IT Project Request form. If you have any questions along the way, send an email with the subject line “Project Question” to help@utulsa.edu. Please make sure the Business Owner and Project Sponsor are clearly indicated and have approved the request before you send it. You will receive an acknowledgment within twenty-four hours. What happens next? The Chief Project Officer (CPO) will contact you to setup a meeting with the appropriate IT Officers and staff to determine the projects feasibility, prioritization, and timelines to be considered. Then your request will be reviewed by IT and evaluated in order to determine feasibility and priority. Some of the factors in the evaluation include: Compliance to fulfill regulatory, audit, accreditation requirements Strategic alignment Benefit (return on investment) Risk (technological, the scope of change) Resources (skills, expertise, estimated staff hours) Timeframe Constraints and dependencies At the conclusion of the review, you will be contacted by the Chief Project Officer with the outcome of your request and to discuss next steps.
