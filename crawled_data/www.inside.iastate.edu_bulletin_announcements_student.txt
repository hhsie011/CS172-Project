COVID-19: By the numbers May 26, 2022 For the week that ended May 22, the positive rate for COVID-19 tests completed at the Thielen Student Health Center was 30% (3 of 10 tests completed), up from 23.9% a week earlier. Testing reflects both symptomatic students and student-athletes following NCAA testing protocols. The vaccination rate among Story County residents at least 5 years old rose to 66.4% as of May 25. Iowa State is providing weekly updates on these and other public health benchmarks on its COVID-19: By the numbers website. May 30 is university holiday May 25, 2022 University offices are closed and classes will not meet Monday, May 30, in observance of the national Memorial Day holiday. Flags temporarily removed from central campus pole May 25, 2022 The American and state of Iowa flags that fly over central campus have been temporarily removed until the aging flag pole can be replaced. A recent inspection discovered structural concerns in the top section of the 80-foot pole, which has withstood numerous wind storms and a derecho. Facilities planning and management staff are working on estimates, including cost and time needed to complete the project. The best estimate is that the current flag pole was installed in the mid-1970s. The university will have flags on display May 30 for the Memorial Day holiday at the Memorial Union east entrance driveway.
