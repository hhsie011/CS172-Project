About Programs Graduate Programs Anesthesiology Clinical Nutrition Pharmacology Radiology Research Research Labs Resources Seminar Series Faculty and Staff The Frontier Between Basic Research and Clinical Research The Department of Molecular Biomedical Sciences trains doctors of veterinary medicine and graduate students interested in research-based careers focused on the discovery of new knowledge about animal and human health and disease and using those findings to enhance animal and human health and well-being. Students get in depth knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of disease, and experience in the development of new procedures which enable its prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Our faculty are recognized experts in the fields of cell biology and physiology, cancer biology, developmental biology, environmental science and toxicology, genomics, infectious diseases, neuroscience, pharmacology, radiology, and reproductive biology. Our goals are to advance veterinary medical science through innovative basic and applied research, and by mentoring and inspiring students, providing world-class clinical and diagnostic services, and offering the public the latest knowledge through innovative extension and engagement activities. Our research faculty work in state-of-the-art research facilities including a transgenic mouse facility where graduate students can participate in research projects related to mouse and animal genomics.
