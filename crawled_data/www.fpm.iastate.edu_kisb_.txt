With that, the Keep Iowa State Beautiful initiative was established to maintain this high standard. The initiative's campaign slogan: "Cy Says... Keep It Clean, Keep It Green." Mission Create a culture of beautification on campus, to encourage individuals and teams to monitor designated areas, and to host events for the campus and community to remove litter thereby beautifying campus and the surrounding areas. Goals Program goals include: Making the campus community more aware of the need to stop littering and to remove litter from university grounds Helping student groups who organize events monitor their trash procedures and thus limit litter Creating teams of people to periodically pick up campus areas Collaborate with the Spring Stash the Trash event to pick up litter on and off campus Contact E-mail: kisb@iastate.edu Adopt Campus Program The Adopt Campus Program is an opportunity to beautify Iowa State on your own schedule. It is designed for groups of people (e.g., students, faculty, staff, and community members) to remove litter from campus. Recruit your student organization members, your staff, your house mates, your friends, or anyone you can find to help beautify campus. For more information, e-mail kisb@iastate.edu.
