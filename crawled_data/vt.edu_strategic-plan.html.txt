The Virginia Tech Difference: Advancing Beyond Boundaries guides initial steps to achieving our long-term Beyond Boundaries future as a comprehensive research land-grant university by affirming our vision, mission, and core values; defining university priorities; and outlining goals and initial milestones to achieve each priority. The Strategic Affairs team has worked with leadership within the Office for Inclusion and Diversity throughout this process to ensure alignment between the Office for Inclusion and Diversity's strategic planning efforts and the integration of the campus’ diversity plan within the university strategic planning framework. The Office for Strategic Affairs will continue to collaborate and partner with the Office for Inclusion and Diversity to ensure continued alignment. The Office for Strategic Affairs will continue to collaborate and partner with colleges, institutes, offices, and units in the development of unit-level strategic plans as part of the continuous planning process. THE PLAN IN ACTION The Virginia Tech Difference: Advancing Beyond Boundaries reinforces our university's established strengths and serves as a university-level guide for colleges, institutes, offices, departments, and units as they develop their respective strategies and plans to advance institutional priorities. The university strategic plan has been adopted by Virginia Tech since its unanimous approval by the Board of Visitors on June 3, 2019.
