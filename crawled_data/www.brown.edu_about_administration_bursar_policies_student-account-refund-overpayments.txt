This method ensures timely and accurate processing of your eligible refund. Please submit your refund request no earlier than 5 days prior to the beginning of the semester. Refunds will be processed once the semester begins and credit balances are a result of actual aid disbursements or payments on the student account. (Anticipated aid or memos are not eligible to be refunded.) Step 1: Setup an eRefund account at https://payment.brown.edu to receive a refund electronically to a U.S. personal checking or savings account. This can ONLY be done via the student's login. See our EBill & Payment Guide for help. This should be done BEFORE submitting this form. If no eRefund account is setup, a refund will be processed via paper check. This will delay the timing of your refund. Step 2: Complete and submit a Student Refund Request Form. Note: Refunds will be reviewed and processed once the semester begins. Refunds cannot be issued prior to the beginning of the semester. A refund is not valid when a credit balance is the result of anticipated aid or memo items.
