We encourage you to seek outside scholarship opportunities through your high school, parents, employers, community-based organizations, and corporations. While many scholarships can be designated for incoming freshmen, other opportunities are designed to support transfer students or upperclass students. It takes some ongoing research to find scholarship opportunities, but it can be worth the effort and time required. Using a Scholarship to Pay Your Bill Students who have been given a scholarship check should endorse the check, complete the Scholarship Check Processing Form and mail all related documents to the address below. When mailing checks please include the students name, date of birth, and if possible, the student's ID (M#). This is especially important for students with common last names such as Smith, Jones, Johnson, etc. Prepaid sponsorship/scholarship checks should be mailed to: Sponsored Student Accounts University of Cincinnati PO Box 210140 Cincinnati, OH 45221-0140 When we receive a scholarship check that has been made payable to the student and the university, the Bursar's Office will contact the student to come to the One Stop Student Center and endorse the check so that it can be processed. Checks for amounts less than $2,500 will be applied fully to Fall semster unless otherwise specified by the student or donor. All other amounts are divided equally between Fall and Spring Semesters. Sponsors please note that once the award is posted to a student's account and funds have been disbursed to the student your organization will need to work directly with the student for the return of any funds. Sponsors can download a signed copy of a W-9 Form completed with UC's data if needed.
