The building, originally completed in 1903, housed machinery and drafting space for the school of engineering. Today the building is home of the Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences (DEEPS), who plan to re-occupy the building after renovations. Currently, the DEEPS program is located across three buildings on campus. This renovation will accommodate the existing Lincoln Field program and anticipated growth, and usher the building into the 21st century. The program is in alignment with Brown's strategic plan Building on Distinction: A New Plan for Brown (2013). Construction will begin in Sept. 2021 and be completed for the fall semester of 2022.
