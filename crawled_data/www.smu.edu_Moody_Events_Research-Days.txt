Each spring, the Moody School hosts SMU Research Days, a showcase and celebration of graduate and undergraduate student research at SMU, in collaboration with the Office of Engaged Learning. This year, Research Days is going virtual. Graduate and undergraduate students will have the opportunity to compete in 5-minute research presentation video competitions with cash prizes, and competitor videos will be publicly available on this site March 15-19. Our offices will also host live talks and panels at the week of March 15-19. Students will be asked to register for the competition by Friday, Feb. 5, and to submit videos by Mon., March 8. To help competition participants to prepare, experts in OIT will host information sessions and hold office hours on video production and editing. For general questions and questions about the graduate student research presentation video competition, please contact Dr. Alan Itkin (aitkin@smu.edu). For questions about the undergraduate research presentation video competition, please contact Dr. Adam Neal (asneal@smu.edu). We look forward to seeing you, virtually, at the live events and to sharing the exciting research your students are doing with our community of scholars. 2021 Research Days Dean's Award Winners Judging Group First name Last name Co-authors, if applicable Presentation title Program Anthropology Bonnie Etter Molly Murphy Adams, Artist and Art Appraiser Ceci n'est pas une pipe Anthropology Biological Sciences Lauren Ammerman James McCormick (co-first author), Chanyang Park, Courtney Follit, Jesiska Lowe, Pia Vogel, and John Wise.
