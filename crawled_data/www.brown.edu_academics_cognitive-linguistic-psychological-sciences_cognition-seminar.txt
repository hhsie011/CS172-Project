Often these topics are discussed in the framework of Cognitive Science, Cognitive Neuroscience, Computational Modeling, Behavioral Neuroscience, and more. CogSem takes place in Metcalf Research Building, Room 305 (Dome room). Open to all members of the Brown community. Upcoming talks are announced on the CogSem mailing list. 2021-2022 Speakers October 22: Leor Zmigrod, University of Cambridge: A neurocognitive model of ideological thinking November 5: Vishnu Murty, Temple University: Agency, Memory, and the Construction of Cohesive Events November 19: Janice Chen, John Hopkins University: Brain Dynamics Underlying Memory for Continuous Natural Events December 3: Apoorva Bhandari, Brown University: Flexible representations for a nimble cognition February 11: Meghan Gallo, Brown University: Exposure to early life adversity disrupts mechanisms of reward learning and decision making in mice March 4: Alexander Fengler, Brown University: Simulation Based Inference for Cognitive Process Models March 11: Claire Gillan, Trinity College Dublin: Getting personal with network theory of mental health and illness March 25: Charan Ranganath, UC Davis: Moments for Memories April 8: Claudio Toro Serey, Harvard Medical School: Evaluating the neural juxtaposition of value-related and introspective cognitive functions in individuals May 27: James Howard, Brandeis University: To be specific: neural mechanisms of reward identity learning in the human brain 2020-2021 Speakers September 11: Alexander Fengler, Alana Jaskir, Jason Leng, Harrizon Ritz, Brown University September 25: Jonathan Kominsky, Rutgers University: The development of causal thought October 9: Maureen Ritchey, Boston College: Making memories: Brain networks supporting episodic binding and reconstruction October 23: Hwamee Oh, Brown University: Visual scene memory in aging and preclinical Alzheimer’s disease November 6: Marion Rouault, ENS Paris: Metacognitive signals for learning and decision-making November 20: Tomer Ullman, Harvard University: Models of Core Knowledge (Physics, Really) January 29: Megan deBettencourt, Chicago: Dynamics of attention and memory February 12: Emily Levin, Brown University: Predicted utility influences fidelity of WM representations February 26: Ida Momennejad, Microsoft: Navigation Turing Test: Toward Human-like RL March 12: Robb Rutledge, Yale University: A Computational and Neural Model for Mood Dynamics March 26: Mingyu Song, Princeton University: Using Recurrent Neural Networks to Understand Human Reward Learning April 9: Babak Hemmatian, Brown University: Taking the High Road: a Big Data Investigation of Natural Discourse in the Emerging Consensus about Marijuana Legalization April 23: Taraz Lee, University of Michigan: Motivation-cognition interactions and their effect on skilled action 2019-2020 Speakers October 11: Debbie Yee, Brown University October 25: Eunkyu Hwang, Brown University / Harrison Ritz, Brown University November 8: Sam Mckenzie, New York University November 22: Arif Hamid, Brown University December 13: Meghan Gallo, Brown University/ TBD January 31: Michael Bernstein, Brown University February 7: Ishita Dasgupta, Princeton University February 14: Luke Chang, Dartmouth College February 21: Juliet Davidow, Northeastern University February 28: TBD March 6: Maureen Ritchey, Boston College March 13: TBD March 20: Tomer Ullman, Harvard University April 3: Danny Ullman, Brown University April 10: Jeroen Van Baar, Brown University April 13: Liane Young, Boston College April 17: TBD April 24: Hwamee Oh, Brown University May 1: Amrita Lamba & Joey Heffner, Brown University May 8: Saaid Mendoza, Providence College Past Speakers 2018-2019 David Sobel,Brown University (Sept. 28)Bridging the gap between children’s causal and scientific reasoning Jeffrey Starns, UMass, Amherst: (Oct. 5) Validity of researcher inference in recognition memory: A blinded validation study Sydney Levine, MIT/Harvard University: (Oct. 12) The Use of Moral Rules and Representations: Case Studies with Preschoolers and Adults Caterina Magri, Harvard University: (Oct. 26) TBA Babak Hemmatian, Brown University: (Nov. 2) TBA Hyley Dorfman, Harvard University: (Nov. 9) TBA Leah Bakst, Boston University: (Nov. 16) TBA Linda Yu, Brown University: (Nov. 30) TBA 2015-2016 Florian Jaeger, University of Rochester: From processing to language change and cross-linguistic distributions Heidi Baumgartner, Brown University: Interactions between visual attention and memory in infancy Marjorie Rhode, NYU The implications of essentialism for biological and social thought George Kachergis, NYU: Memory- and Uncertainty-driven Attention to Learn Nouns--and More!
