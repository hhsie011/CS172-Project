Physicists use mathematics to help them comprehend the enormous complexity of the world: to them, as to Galileo, "mathematics is the language of Nature." Miles P. Blencowe, Professor of Physics and Astronomy, teaching Physics 30, Biological Physics PreviousNext Overview As our knowledge of the physical world becomes deeper, more of it becomes amenable to mathematical formulation, and hence part of physics: for example, atoms used to be regarded as the domain of the chemist alone, while now atomic physics is at the core of the physics curriculum. Mathematics also advances, and becomes able to tackle problems previously thought to be beyond its scope. The great physicist Richard Feynman said in 1963 that he could not conceive of a mathematical description of a cloud, but at that very moment Benoit Mandelbrot was developing the mathematics of "fractals," which turned out to provide just that description. As a result, new branches of physics, such as condensed matter physics and non-linear dynamics, are continually coming into being, as are hybrids with other sciences, for example, chemical physics, geophysics, biophysics and psychophysics. It has been truly said that without chemistry there would be no life: but without physics there would not be anything at all. The first half of the 20th century saw a revolution in physics, in which "classical" physics, which reigned supreme in 1900, was replaced in the domain of the very large by relativity and in that of the very small by quantum theory. This revolution was comparable in its philosophical implications to the great scientific revolution of the 17th Century (also, primarily, the work of physicists and astronomers). However, just as the latter did not significantly affect the consciousness of the general educated public until the following century, so the profound changes in our view of the world that this century's revolution requires, though the subject of much popular writing, have yet to be fully assimilated. Physics is not just a branch of technology but is one of the humanities, in the sense that its study is one road towards an understanding of our place in the Universe. This may be one reason why so many leaders in the struggle for freedom of thought have been physicists: Albert Einstein, Andrei Sakharov, Edward Condon, Yuri Orlov, Irina Ratushinskaya and Fang Lizhi, for example. Learning outcomes for Physics Students graduating with a B.A. in physics from Dartmouth go on to careers in business, industry, law, teaching, and medicine, as well as to graduate school in physics, astronomy, history of science, and earth science. The physics major at Dartmouth is designed to provide students with a solid foundation in analytic thinking, problem solving, and the fundamentals of physics. The introductory courses are offered at a number of levels: you can begin a physics major at Dartmouth even if you've never had any physics before. There are also introductory sequences designed for students with advanced placement in just math, or in math and physics both. Later on, a wide variety of upper level electives allow each student to tailor the physics and astronomy major to match their own interests. Students who are interested in both the fundamental aspects of physics and in practical applications may want to consider the Engineering Physics major . This program offers a broad array of courses drawn from both the Physics and Astronomy department and the Thayer School of Engineering.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Physics and Astronomy Undergraduate Overview Information for New Students Physics Major Astronomy Major Engineering Physics Major Undergraduate Awards Honors Recent Senior Theses Undergraduate Requirements Physics and Astronomy Course Offerings Physics Society Student Research Opportunities Careers in Physics and Astronomy Astronomy and Your Career Undergraduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Graduate Overview Graduate Awards Apply Financial Aid Degree Requirements Courses Recent PhD Graduates Graduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Foreign Study Overview Astronomy FSP in South Africa Research Overview All Projects Astrophysics Current Projects Particles, Fields, Gravitation, and Cosmology Current Projects Gravitational Quantum Physics Quantum and Condensed Matter Current Projects Plasma and Space Physics Current Projects Resources Overview Weather Archive News & Events News & Events Colloquia Physics and Astronomy Colloquia Colloquium Archives (before 2017) Symposiums Symposium on Charles Young's 1869 Discovery of Coronium Jay Lawrence Symposium Archive Pressure of Light Symposium Public Lecture Archives Public Observing People Faculty & Staff Students Alumni Advisory Board Membership Directory Committee Assignments Department Chair Diversity Statement Graduate Advisor Undergraduate Advisor My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
