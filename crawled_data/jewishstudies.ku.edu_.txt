We invite all students, alumni and friends to see what we're up to here at KU as well as in the surrounding communities. Why major in Jewish Studies? Because Jewish Studies offers a creative environment to learn, think, and reflect about Jewish culture, history, communities, and religion from both a national and global perspective. Renee Perelmutter has been appointed next program director of Jewish Studies! Professor Perelmutter’s term will begin this summer. Professor Perelmutter will succeed John Younger, who retires this summer, having served since 2013. Read about this exciting transition in the Kansas City Jewish Chronicle: "Perelmutter is an Associate Professor at KU and is jointly appointed between Jewish studies and Slavic languages and literatures. Prior to this appointment, Perelmutter served as director of undergraduate studies in both Jewish studies and in Slavic languages and literatures. Over the years, Perelmutter developed and taught a variety of courses on Jewish cultures and languages... Perelmutter enjoys advising and mentoring students, and these efforts have been recognized by the Michael J. Young award for undergraduate advising. Twice Perelmutter has been selected as a finalist for the K. Barbara Schowen undergraduate research award for supporting undergraduate research in Jewish Studies and beyond."
