This form is for registration changes that cannot be made in SSOL during registration appointment times and/or for changes made outside of the Add/Drop period. Registration changes will be processed in the order they are received. If you need approval to register for a course (for example if you are a GSAPP student cross-registering outside of GSAPP, or if you have permission to enroll in a class that is currently over capacity), please forward an email stating you have permission from the department / instructor to studentaffairs@arch.columbia.edu along with this form. If you are trying to add an Internship course, you must forward permission from your program's Career Services officer / program manager. Please complete the form with accurate information (call numbers, course titles, etc.) Invalid entries will result in the form being rejected. * = required Student Information First Name* Middle Name Last Name* Birthdate* Birthdate* JanuaryFebruaryMarchAprilMayJuneJulyAugustSeptemberOctoberNovemberDecember12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031202220212020201920182017201620152014201320122011201020092008200720062005200420032002200120001999199819971996199519941993199219911990198919881987198619851984198319821981198019791978197719761975197419731972197119701969196819671966196519641963196219611960195919581957195619551954195319521951195019491948194719461945194419431942194119401939193819371936193519341933193219311930192919281927192619251924192319221921192019191918191719161915191419131912191119101909190819071906190519041903190219011900 UNI* Semester* Summer 2022Fall 2022Spring 2023 Current Program* Introduction to ArchitectureM.S.
