Admission requirements Inside the Program Student playwright receives national honors Theatre students at WSU have many opportunities to show off their talents on a big stage. That's the case for Josh Whedon, whose original play, "States of Happiness," won the WSU Playwriting Competition before being chosen for a regional performance in Iowa. The critics were impressed, because "States of Happiness" -- an all-student production -- was then honored as one of only 10 distinguished productions in the nation by the Kennedy Center American College Theatre Festival in Washington, D.C.
