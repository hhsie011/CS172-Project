Expand all Collapse all Term Life Insurance Basic Plan Local 100 employees who have completed six months of service are eligible for the Basic Term Life Insurance Plan provided by Columbia University at no cost to you. This Plan provides a benefit of one times your Annual Benefits Salary, up to $50,000. The Basic Term Life Insurance plan pays a lump sum benefit to your beneficiary in the event of your death while actively employed by Columbia University. The Plan can also pay a living benefit. If you become terminally ill, you may elect to have the Plan pay out a benefit while you are still living. Any amount you receive will reduce the benefit paid to your beneficiary. Optional Plan You may elect additional amounts of coverage of one to five times your Annual Benefits Salary up to a maximum of $1,000,000, including your Basic Term Life Insurance coverage amount. The premium payment for additional coverage is paid with post-tax dollars. The benefit will be determined using your Annual Benefits Salary rounded to the next highest $1,000. You will see your personal monthly premiums on CUBES based on your age. Login CUBES to add or update beneficiaries at any time during your employment.
