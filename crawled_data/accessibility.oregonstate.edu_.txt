One of Oregon State’s core values is that we believe that diversity is a key to success. And we regard our commitment to providing optimal accessibility as central to OSU’s goal of being one of the nation’s premier land grant universities. We recognize that the university’s overall success requires that people with disabilities are full members of Oregon State’s educational community. We have created this website to chronicle progress and to inform our campus community and the public of Oregon State’s efforts related to accessibility, including planning, assessment, organizational changes and improvement projects. Please use this site to follow Oregon State’s progress in this endeavor. Help us move forward by making suggestions for improving this website, and for enhancing accessibility at Oregon State, by directing comments and suggestions to the OSU Office of Equal Opportunity and Access’s accessibility email address. Working together, we will realize our dream of a universally accessible university.
