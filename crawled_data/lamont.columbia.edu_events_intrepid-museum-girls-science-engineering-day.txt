The Intrepid Museum annually hosts a special day focused on introducing young women to a wide range of possible futures in STEM fields. This year, our summer interns from the Next Gen program will participate on March 12 from 11am to 3pm to share their experiences firsthand, including some of the fun activities they developed over the summer. Through an assortment of games, infographics, colorful public service announcements, and short videos, people can learn about the Hudson and their experiences. Additionally, the group will share data they collected through completing habitat assessments, lead testing, water chemistry, and fish collection, with a goal of inspiring more girls to participate in STEM experiences and careers!
