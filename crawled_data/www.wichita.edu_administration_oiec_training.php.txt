The WSU community relies on the cooperation of all employees and students to accomplish this goal. Title IX is a federal law enacted in 1972 that prohibits sex discrimination in all university student services and academic programs. Title IX also forbids discrimination on the basis of sex in employment and recruitment for institutions receiving or benefiting from federal financial assistance. The federal government has determined that employees who have the authority to redress sexual violence, or whom a student could reasonably believe has this authority, or employees who have been given the duty of reporting incidents of sexual violence or any other misconduct, have an obligation to report Title IX violations to appropriate university officials. These individuals also have an obligation to provide resource information to the involved parties. The Title IX Mandatory Reporter (Responsible Employee)/ Campus Security Authority online training is approximately one hour. To take the training go to myWSU, select the Faculty/Staff tab, select myTraining under the Quick Links channel, select Online training, select the Title IX Responsible Employee and Campus Security Authority module, select request, select launch. All Responsible Employees and Campus Security Authorities are required to complete this training annually. Training Materials for Grievance Process Pool and Title IX Team Title IX, the Violence Against Women Act, and the Clery Act require Title IX staff to be trained annually.
