8:00 PM Queen's Mansion Columbia Global Centers | South Asia (Mumbai) and Jnanapravaha Mumbai present The Birth, Death and Re-Birth of Latin American Cinema March 14, 2016 at 6.30 p.m. Reception at 6 p.m. Venue: Queens Mansion, 3rd Floor, Ghanshyam Talwatkar Marg, Fort, Mumbai Appearing scarcely six months after its initial public presentation in Paris, the cinema spread rapidly throughout Latin America, quickly becoming the “pastime of choice” for everyone from the wealthiest elites to the popular masses. Yet the actual ﬁlm industries of Latin America have had a more tumultuous path: these cinemas have gone from international acclaim and box office success to near-extinction, at times within the space of a few years. Covering the past 120 years of Latin American ﬁlm history, Columbia University professor Richard Peña will delineate the region’s major trends and characteristics of cinema in production and as an institution. Richard Peña was the Program Director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Director of the New York Film Festival from 1988 until 2012. At the Film Society, Peña organized retrospectives of many ﬁlm artists, including Michelangelo Antonioni, Sacha Guitry, Abbas Kiarostami, King Hu, Robert Aldrich, Roberto Gavaldon, Ritwik Ghatak, Kira Muratova, Fei Mu, Jean Eustache, Youssef Chahine, Yasujiro Ozu, Carlos Saura and Amitabh Bachchan, as well as major ﬁlm series devoted to various cinemas from across the world. He is a Professor of Film Studies at Columbia University, where he specializes in ﬁlm theory and international cinema.
