Students become experts on particular global issues and then meet with other "diplomats" representing countries around the world to write resolutions. These resolutions address a variety of global problems (ex: maintaining international peace and security, protecting human rights, promoting development, protecting the environment). Students hone their skills in research, writing, public speaking, and negotiation by participating in this exciting endeavor.
