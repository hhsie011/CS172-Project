Students learn the latest techniques and strategies in digital age communication and how to apply them in briefings and discussions with London professionals at global public relations and advertising companies and at news organizations like the B.B.C., The New York Times and BuzzFeed. Students take in the cultural, historical and political life of London and work on assignments in the British Museum, the Tate Modern, parliament, at Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abby and other iconic institutions. They get briefings at Oxford University and at the adjacent Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. They live in shared apartments with kitchens and get the feel of London as they walk to briefings and meetings, ride the underground and the big red buses, shop for groceries and sample Shepherd’s Pie, bangers and beans and bubble and squeak. They mingle with the diverse, international throngs in Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square.
