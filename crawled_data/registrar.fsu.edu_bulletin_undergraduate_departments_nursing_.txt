The undergraduate program is approved by the Florida Board of Nursing and accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (http://www.ccneaccreditation.org/). At the completion of the program the student will have met all major requirements for the BSN. The graduate of the undergraduate nursing program will have met the academic eligibility requirements for taking the registered nurse state licensing examination. The mission of the College of Nursing is to educate clinicians, leaders, scholars, and advanced practitioners who can enhance the quality of life for people of all cultures, economic levels, and geographic locations. The College of Nursing integrates the liberal arts and sciences with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes essential for lifelong learning, personal responsibility, and sustained achievement in the nursing professional and the communities in which our graduates work. The program is an upper division limited access major, accepting students in the junior year, with required sequential course offerings and elective courses in nursing. The nursing courses are based on concepts and principles from liberal studies, the supporting biological and behavioral sciences, and nursing. This theoretical base is used with the nursing process in the systematic development of nursing care for individuals and groups in a variety of health care settings. The College of Nursing offers honors in the major to encourage talented students to undertake independent research. For requirements and other information, see the “University Honors Office and Honor Societies” section of this General Bulletin. For complete details of programs offered and admission requirements, plus a description of the college, its facilities, opportunities, and available financial assistance, refer to the “College of Nursing” chapter of this General Bulletin. For current course offerings, please refer to the FSU College of Nursing Website, at https://nursing.fsu.edu/. Computer Skills Competency All undergraduates at Florida State University must demonstrate basic computer skills competency prior to graduation. As necessary computer competency skills vary from discipline to discipline, each major determines the courses needed to satisfy this requirement. Undergraduate majors in nursing and accelerated nursing satisfy this requirement by earning a grade of “C” or higher in NUR 4169.
