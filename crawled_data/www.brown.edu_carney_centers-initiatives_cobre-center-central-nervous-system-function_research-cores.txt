While both of these cores are dedicated to working with the project leaders, they also aim to reach out to the broader Brown and Rhode Island community. Behavior and Neuroimaging Core The Behavior and Neuroimaging Core, led by David Sheinberg from the Department of Neuroscience, aims to develop best practices for acquiring and analyzing data. This core also works with data scientists to facilitate the optimal use of high-performance computing equipment. Read More Design and Analysis Core The Design and Analysis Core, led by Jean Wu from the Department of Biostatistics, aims to develop new tools and optimizing existing ones to image brain structure and function with MRI and EEG and neural recordings; and ensuring proper experimental design and analysis procedures across projects. The staff of the Design and Analysis Core includes faculty in the Departments of Biostatistics and Computer Science.
