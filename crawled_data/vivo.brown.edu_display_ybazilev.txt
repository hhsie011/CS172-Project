Research Statement Statement Over a decade ago, Computational Science has been identified as “the third pillar of scientific method”, alongside with theory and experimentation, which are considered to be the two original pillars of scientific discovery [1]. It is now safe to say that Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) has “come of age”, and today presents a thriving enterprise that involves the development and use of computational algorithms, and their implementation in the environment of High Performance Computing (HPC), to translate mathematical models of physical phenomena into computer models that ultimately attempt to predict the future. CSE has been successful in a broad and increasing list of scientific and technological developments in basic science, engineering, and medicine, and also presents an integral and ever growing part of many agencies research and development programs. However, as CSE matured, the development of modeling and simulation methods for basic sciences has taken a different path from that of engineering applications. The development of modeling and simulation methods for scientific discovery is focused on elucidating new scientific phenomena in natural or man-made physical systems. In the case of continuum systems, such as solids or fluids, the term “modeling” is often understood as the development, from experimental or observation data, of the novel constitutive relations, such as, for example, interaction potentials, rate-dependent forms of plastic and damage laws, shock and eddy viscosities, etc. The issues of geometric complexity, realistic boundary conditions, topological changes in the problem domain due to fragmentation or contact, etc., are often secondary and thus seldom addressed. Conversely, modeling and simulation in support of engineering design is focused on complex-geometry methods and efficiency of the discretization approaches. The issues of realistic boundary conditions and problem-domain motion become the primary drivers of methods development, and the fundamental physics/mechanics is often traded for empirical models that best fit the computational framework developed for a given application. Models that are easily implemented and that are “inexpensive” to execute are often preferred, especially when a large number of analyses is needed to support design. Nevertheless, the initially divergent paths that modeling and simulation developments have taken in the science and engineering fields are starting to merge. On the one hand, cutting-edge science is becoming increasingly interested in applications involving complex geometry and coupled mechanical phenomena. For example, analysis of metamaterials, which derive their favorable mechanical properties from a specific topological and geometric arrangement of their substructures, relies more and more heavily on complex-geometry discretization methods. Coupled phenomena, such as fluid-solid or fluid-structure interaction (FSI) [2], are essential for accurate modeling of biological cell structures or that of materials subjected to high-strain-rate air-blast loading. On the other hand, the low accuracy of empirical models, which are often employed outside their limited range of applicability, is nowadays seldom compatible with the precision demands of modern engineering. This is especially true in the defense sector. In recent years, in several engineering applications, empiricism is often traded for fundamental, first- principle-based scientific theories. For example, in the area of solids and structures the development of multiscale computational methods is now enabling accurate, efficient, and, most importantly, predictive modeling of structures comprised of complex materials, such as concrete or laminated fiber-reinforced composites. In the area of fluids, large-eddy simulation approaches based on the so-called variational multiscale methods, which make no assumptions about the problem geometry or flow regime, are starting to be routinely employed for engineering-scale aerodynamic and hydrodynamic analyses. While HPC has played a tremendous role in raising the quality and fidelity of computational simulations in science and engineering, 10-15 years ago a new concept of the so-called Dynamic-Data-Driven Application Systems (DDDAS) [3] has emerged that further changed the way CSE is approached these days. DDDAS is a framework in which dynamic and/or static sensor and measurement data collected for a given physical system is used to dynamically update a simulation model of that system. Using measurement data, the model geometry, boundary conditions, forcing, material parameters, etc., may be updated to better represent physical reality. At the same time, the properly updated computational model is able to produce higher-fidelity outputs for the quantities of interest for which measurements are not available, and further steer data measurement through appropriate placement of sensors. As such, DDDAS is a framework in which measurement and simulation co-exist in a symbiotic environment, which further enhances the predictive power of simulation methods. These convergent demands that science and engineering applications place on the modeling and simulation methods today create an opportunity to rethink how these methods are developed and employed in academia, industry, and research labs. In his reserch work, Yuri addresses these demands by developing a first-of-its-kind, unified, predictive modeling framework that incorporates first-principle-based approaches, enables new scientific discovery, and possesses the accuracy, robustness, and efficiency attributes necessary to support modern engineering analysis and design. The PI envisions taking Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) [4], of which he is one of the original developers, as the foundational methodology for the following reasons: IGA was proposed in an effort to “bridge the gap” between Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and the Finite Element Method (FEM) routinely employed in Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE). As such, at its foundation, IGA, unlike other computational technology, has a strong link to CAD and, as a result, engineering design. IGA is function-based computational methodology, which, like FEM, relies on the weak or variational statement of the boundary value problem. As such, IGA is compatible with FEM on several levels: a. Under certain assumptions on the discretization, IGA reduces to standard FEM; b. IGA may be “coupled” with FEM in a straightforward fashion, which is especially useful for multiphysics applications like FSI. This compatibility is important for integration of IGA into existing analysis frameworks, and essential for adoption by users interested in IGA for their applications. For the discretization of the solution fields, IGA makes use of splines, which are piece- wise polynomial functions joined with higher-order continuity. For many problems, arising in both science and engineering, the higher-order nature of splines gives high per- degree-of-freedom accuracy necessary to resolve the spatially multiscale phenomena present in many physical systems. In addition, the increased continuity of the basis functions gives rise to superior robustness necessary for engineering applications. As such, IGA has this rare combination of accuracy and robustness, which is well suited for the proposed modeling and simulation framework that treats science and engineering applications in a unified manner. The PI and his team are pursuing research and development of novel core and special computational methods, where IGA plays a central role as the key unifying concept for CSE. The methods development is driven by advanced applications coming from academia, industry, and national lab collaborations, thus making the corresponding partnerships an essential component of this effort.
