Converting CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels is one of the most practical routes for reducing CO2 emissions while fossil fuels continue to dominate the energy sector. On July 10, Columbia Global Centers | Beijing invites you to a public lecture by Professor Jingguang Chen, Thayer Lindsley Professor and Vice Chair of Chemical Engineering, Columbia Engineering. Professor Chen will be providing a perspective on the challenges and opportunities in converting CO2 via thermocatalysis and electrocatalysis. Speaker Jingguang Chen is the Thayer Lindsley Professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University, with a joint appointment as a senior chemist at Brookhaven National Laboratory. He received his BS degree from Nanjing University and a Ph.D. degree from the University of Pittsburgh. He then carried out his Humboldt postdoctoral research in KFA-Julich in Germany. After spending several years as a staff scientist at Exxon Corporate Research Laboratories, he started his academic career at the University of Delaware in 1998 and rose to the rank of the Claire LeClaire Professor of chemical engineering and the Director of the Center for Catalytic Science and Technology. He moved to Columbia University in 2012. He is the co-author of over 20 United States patents and over 350 journal publications that have been cited over 17,000 times. He is currently the President of the North American Catalysis Society and an Associate Editor of ACS Catalysis. He received many awards in catalysis research, including the 2015 George Olah award from the American Chemical Society and the 2017 Robert Burwell Lectureship from the North American Catalysis Society.
