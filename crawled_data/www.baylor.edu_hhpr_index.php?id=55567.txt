The MAT program is a professional athletic training program accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE). Students graduating from the ATP are eligible to sit for the Board of Certification exam and become a Certified Athletic Trainer (ATC). Students enrolled in the ATP will gain first hand learning experiences with university sponsored athletic teams as well as other off-campus clinical sites. Students have two avenues in which to pursue the MAT degree: 1. Undergraduate students can enroll in a joint degree program that links the Health Science Studies (Pre-AT Track) and MAT degree programs so students can receive two degrees in 5 years. 2. Students receiving a bachelor's degree from another institution are able to apply as a traditional graduate student if they have completed the prerequisite coursework. All students will receive a 50% tuition remission for both years in the program. The 2022-23 cohort is currently full and applications are no longer being considered. Applications for the 2023-24 cohort will open in the summer for a programmatic start in mid-June 2023. The MAT program will begin reviewing applications at the beginning of the fall 2022 semester. Early applications are due October 31, 2022. Students will not have to submit a GRE score to apply.
