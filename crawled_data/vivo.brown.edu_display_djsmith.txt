Tillinghast, Jr. Professor of International Studies Overview Daniel Jordan Smith joined the Department of Anthropology at Brown University in 2001. He received an AB in Sociology from Harvard University (1983), an MPH from Johns Hopkins University (1989), and a PhD in Anthropology from Emory University (1999). Smith conducts research in Nigeria focusing on a range of issues, including population processes, political culture, kinship, infrastructure, and health. He won the 2008 Margaret Mead Award for his book, A Culture of Corruption: Everyday Deception and Popular Discontent in Nigeria (Princeton University Press, 2007). Professor Smith’s second single-authored book, AIDS Doesn’t Show Its Face: Inequality, Morality, and Social Change in Nigeria (University of Chicago Press, 2014) won the 2015 Elliott P. Skinner Award from the Association for Africanist Anthropology. He is also the author of To Be a Man Is Not a One-Day Job: Masculinity, Money, and Intimacy in Nigeria (University of Chicago Press, 2017), which received Special Commendation for the Amaury Talbot Prize for African Anthropology from the Royal Anthropological Institute. Smith's most recent project, for which he received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2020, investigated how Nigerians cope with widespread failures of fundamental infrastructure and basic services, with particular attention to how the resulting entrepreneurial activities and informal economic enterprises are, paradoxically, central to the consolidation of state power and the substance of citizenship. His book based on this research, Every Household Its Own Government: Improvised Infrastructure, Entrepreneurial Citizens, and the State in Nigeria, was published in March 2022 by Princeton University Press. He was the recipient of the 2007-9 William C. McGloughlin Award for Teaching Excellence in the Social Sciences and from 2015 until 2018 he was appointed a Royce Family Professor of Teaching Excellence. From 2006-2011 he was Associate Director of the Population Studies and Training Center and from 2012-2019 he was Chair of the Department of Anthropology. In 2017, Smith was the keynote speaker at Brown's Convocation. He is currently Director of the Watson Institute's Africa Initiative and Director of Graduate Studies in the Department of Anthropology.

Full Text Research Research Overview Professor Smith conducts research in medical anthropology, anthropological demography, and political anthropology in sub-Saharan Africa, with a specific focus on Nigeria. His research in medical and demographic anthropology includes work on HIV/AIDS, reproductive health and behavior, adolescent sexuality, marriage, kinship, and rural-urban migration. His work on political culture in Nigeria includes studies of patron-clientism, Pentecostal Christianity, vigilantism, corruption, and infrastructure. Research Statement Broadly, Professor Smith's research focuses on understanding the intersection of social change and social reproduction, particularly as it unfolds in population processes and health-related behavior. Completed research projects have investigated the influence of migration on family organization and reproductive behavior as people live across rural-urban boundaries. Smith has also studied the effects of rural-urban migration on sexual behavior and HIV risk among adolescents and unmarried young adults. He led the Nigeria component of an NIH-supported, five-country comparative ethnographic study entitled "Love, Marriage, and HIV." The research examined the changing expectations and pragmatics of modern marriage, documenting and analyzing the organization and opportunity structures of extramarital relationships, investigating how gender is configured in contemporary sexual and romantic relationships, and evaluating the effect of these patterns on the transmission of HIV. More recently, Smith completed a study of the ways that Pentecostal Christianity in Nigeria has intersected with the AIDS epidemic, looking at the seemingly paradoxical role of these popular churches in both exacerbating stigma and offering important places of support for people living with HIV. Smith’s work also examines political culture in Nigeria, especially issues related to inequality and development. Much of this work focuses on understanding the intersection of social imagination, politics, and contemporary issues in Nigeria, including democracy, violence, vigilantism, corruption, and infrastructure. His first book, A Culture of Corruption: Everyday Deception and Popular Discontent in Nigeria (Princeton University Press, 2007), for which he received the 2008 Margaret Mead Award, examines ordinary Nigerians' participation in corruption, even as they are its main victims and its loudest critics. His second book, a co-authored volume, The Secret: Love, Marriage, and HIV (Vanderbilt University Press, 2009), presents comparative findings from the five-country study described above. Professor Smith’s second single-authored book, AIDS Doesn’t Show Its Face: Inequality, Morality, and Social Change in Nigeria (University of Chicago Press, 2014), for which he received the 2015 Elliott P. Skinner Award, analyzes popular responses to the AIDS epidemic as a prism to understand wider phenomena. His third single-authored book, To Be a Man Is Not a One-Day Job: Masculinity, Money, and Intimacy in Nigeria (University of Chicago Press, 2017), focuses on masculinity in Nigeria, exploring the intertwining dynamics of money and intimacy, as gender sits at the center of complex social transformations. It received Special Commendation for the Amaury Talbot Prize for African Anthropology from the Royal Anthropological Institute. Smith's most recent research examined how Nigerians manage to cobble together basic infrastructure in the face of state failure to deliver essential services, with particular attention to how these processes in fact contribute to state power and constitute the substance of citizenship. His book based on this research, Every Household Its Own Government: Improvised Infrastructure, Entrepreneurial Citizens, and the State in Nigeria, was published by Princeton University Press in March 2022.
