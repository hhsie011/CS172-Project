All campuses are relatively level and have conveniently located sidewalks, curb cuts, and accessible parking. Most buildings are equipped with ramps, elevators, and adapted restrooms. Many buildings have automatic entrance doors. The University continues its long-range plan to upgrade and improve campus accessibility. Campus accessibility maps for Belknap, Health Sciences, and Shelby campuses are available from the Visitor Information Center (852-6565), and the Parking Division of the Department of Public Safety (852-PARK). The maps are designed to assist individuals with mobility impairments to plan travel routes and effectively utilize campus facilities. A tactile/Braille map is planned to help orient individuals with visual impairments. Campus accessibility features may also be identified at the Center for Geographic Information Systems. Parking A University of Louisville disabled permit is required to park in designated disabled spaces at the University. Individuals with mobility impairment should contact the Parking Office at 852-7275 for specific parking information. A verification of disability is required before obtaining a University of Louisville disabled parking permit. The Parking Office must initiate a letter for verification. Visit the Department of Public Safety, Parking Division web page for specific information on how to apply for a permit. There are Disabled Parking spaces on each campus. Visitors The University of Louisville is committed to providing access for individuals with disabilities to programs that are open to the public. Institutional departments that offer programs or events that are open to the public must publish information available to participants with disabilities informing them to request in advance any accommodations needed to allow them to attend or fully participate. Public events and programs include, but are not limited to, non-credit courses, public lectures and cultural events, graduation ceremonies, and athletic competitions. Brochures, registration forms, press releases, and posters announcing public programs and events should include the following statement: "Please indicate if you need any special services, assistance, or accommodations to participate in this program by contacting (name of sponsoring department) at (phone number of department or program) by (date)." Any qualified individual should give reasonable advance notice of needing an accommodation. However, any reasonable requests should be responded to with the goal of providing access to, and participation in, University of Louisville programs. The host department or office must designate a person(s) to be responsible for handling requests for accommodation as the designated campus contact for the program or event. The institutional department or office sponsoring the event must take into account the need to pay for reasonable accommodations that may be requested by the public. © University of Louisville Contact Privacy Statement Apply Undergraduate Transfer Graduate Dentistry Law Medicine MBA International Online Learning Jobs Donate Emergency Login Email ULink PeopleSoft HR PeopleSoft Campus Solutions PeopleSoft Financials Blackboard Business Ops CardSmart CardBox Cards Career Connection Plone Contact Privacy Statement Apply Undergraduate Transfer Graduate Dentistry Law Medicine MBA International Online Learning Campuses Belknap HSC Online Jobs Donate Emergency Login Email ULink PeopleSoft HR PeopleSoft Campus Solutions PeopleSoft Financials Blackboard Business Ops CardSmart CardBox Cards Career Connection Plone © University of Louisville
