With “Are You Listening,” Stuart brought together groups of people who had a particular experience in common, and encouraged them to speak openly and candidly with each other in order to exchange their perspectives and experiences. In this 1968 episode of "Are You Listening: Black High School Girls," young women from South Bend, Indiana—who participated in an Upward Bound program at Saint Mary's College—talk about school, violence, parents, race, and role models.
