Years before #Me Too, this shocking crime launched a national dialogue about the role of community and media in the perpetuation of rape culture, the failure of bystander intervention, and toxic masculinity. On April 29th, in conjunction with SVR’s recognition of Denim Day, we invite you to join us for a screening of the film “Roll Red Roll”, directed by Columbia School of the Arts filmmaker Nancy Schwartzman. This film explores the extensive cover-up perpetrated by a close-knit community and the complicity of media culture that regularly engages in blaming and shaming victims of sexual assault. After the screening, stay for a talk back session with Ms. Schwartzman, a noted film maker, advocate, and human rights activist, to discuss the film and the issues it underscores.
