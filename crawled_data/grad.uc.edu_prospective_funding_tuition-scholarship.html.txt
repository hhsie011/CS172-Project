The appointing program sends offers of scholarship awards in writing, including information about the amount and duration of the award and the terms of the offer. Please note that GIA and GAS scholarship decisions are made by the colleges and graduate programs, not the Graduate School. Please contact your prospective or current graduate program to ask about scholarship opportunities, criteria, and deadlines. Students receiving a GIA or GAS must be registered for at least the number of graduate credit hours covered by the GIA or GAS in each semester for which they are receiving support. The GIA is for graduate students who are not graduate assistants, and therefore no service is required in return for the award. The GAS is for graduate students who are graduate assistants. These students must meet the eligibility requirements in their Graduate Assistant letter to maintain their GAS. Students registered for more than 18 credits in a semester will be billed tuition and general fees on a per-credit-hour rate for each additional credit. Other rules and policies that apply specifically to international students are independent of GIA/GAS regulations. Neither negates or takes the place of the other.
