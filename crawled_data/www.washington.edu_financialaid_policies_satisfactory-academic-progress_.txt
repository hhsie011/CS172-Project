There are separate policies for undergraduate and graduate students. Professional students must meet the policy set by their specific program. Students are responsible for knowing these policies. Undergraduate students Undergraduate students must meet the requirements for satisfactory academic progress (SAP) based on the aid they are receiving. Many students need to meet the requirement in both the Federal Aid SAP policy as well as the State and Institutional Aid SAP policy. You can review your award notice on MyUW to see what type of aid you have been awarded. Federal aid typically consists of Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Grants (SEOG), Federal Work Study, Federal Direct Subsidized Stafford, Unsubsidized Stafford and Parent PLUS loans. State and institutional aid typically consists of Washington College Grant, College Bound, University Tuition Exemption and University Grant. If you are not sure about which requirements you need to meet, or if you have questions about the different policies, please contact one of our financial aid counselors. Pell Grant and Federal Loans are examples of federal aid. Washington College Grant, Tuition Exemption and University Grant are examples of state and institutional aid. The requirements for Federal, State and Institutional Aid SAP policies are the same for maximum time frame for degree completion, minimum grade point average, grades counted in successful completion and how to re-establish eligibility. Federal aid To remain eligible for federal financial aid undergraduates must meet the requirements below: Complete a minimum of 80% of the cumulative credits you attempted. At the end of spring quarter each year, we will divide your total credits completed by your cumulative attempted credits. If the percentage is 80% or above, you have met the progress requirements and should be on pace to finish your degree before the maximum timeframe. Finish your program within a maximum timeframe, which cannot exceed 225 attempted cumulative credits. You must maintain at least a 2.0 cumulative GPA as measured at the end of spring quarter. If you do not meet the 80% or minimum GPA requirements or exceed the maximum timeframe limit, you are no longer eligible for federal financial aid unless granted an exception based on the appeal process described below. State and institutional aid To remain eligible for state and institutional financial aid undergraduates must meet the requirements below: Full-time students (12 or more credits per quarter) Complete a minimum of 6 credits each quarter. Complete 36 credits for full-time aid received in the autumn through spring quarters (and 48 credits for the summer through spring quarters). Finish your program within a maximum timeframe, which cannot exceed 225 attempted cumulative credits. You must maintain at least a 2.0 cumulative GPA as measured at the end of Spring quarter. Part-time students (less than 12 credits per quarter) Complete a minimum of 50% of your attempted credits each quarter and by the end of Spring quarter each year: Complete 9 credits per quarter for 9-11 credits of enrollment. Complete 6 credits per quarter for 6-8 credits of enrollment. Complete all credits attempted for quarters when enrollment if less than six credits. Finish your program within a maximum time frame, which cannot exceed 225 attempted cumulative credits. You must maintain at least a 2.0 cumulative GPA as measured at the end of Spring quarter. If you do not meet the quarterly credit or annual credit and GPA requirements, you are no longer eligible for state and institutional financial aid unless you are granted an exception based on the appeal process described below. Please note: To complete your degree in 4 years, you need to complete at least 45 credits per year. To complete your degree in 5 years, you need to complete at least 36 credits per year. Maximum time frame for degree completion All undergraduates are expected to finish their program within a maximum timeframe, which cannot exceed 225 attempted credits. For most undergraduate programs once you have reached 225 attempted credits on your UW transcript, you are no longer eligible for financial aid. Students who have used up the maximum timeframe and have not completed their degree yet may petition, through the regular appeal process described below, for an extension based on extenuating circumstances which prevented the completion of the degree program. Although students may receive up to 225 credits for the completion of an undergraduate degree or extensions of this amount based on limited appeal approvals, some aid programs are further limited by cumulative maximums for the lifetime of the student. It is important to try and complete your degree program before you reach the cumulative aggregate maximums for federal loans, the lifetime limit of the Pell Program (six years), the 15 quarter limit on Washington College Grant or the 12 quarter limit on the Husky Promise program. For post-baccalaureate students, you must finish your program within a maximum time frame that cannot exceed 115 attempted credits. Minimum grade point average Besides the financial aid requirement of a 2.0 cumulative GPA at the end of spring quarter, students must maintain the 2.0 minimum grade point average (GPA) for continued attendance at the University. Please review the Academic Probation and Dismissal for Low Scholarship policy for these additional requirements. Passing grades for successful completion Passing grades used to compute completed credits are numerical grades of 0.7 or higher, N (used for hyphenated courses lasting longer than one quarter); S (Satisfactory) or CR (credit) and must be earned in residence at the UW. Residence credits are academic credit for courses offered through the UW Quarterly Time Schedule and certain other approved courses which are listed individually on your UW academic transcript. Repeated credits count as completed credits provided the course is successfully completed. Both the original and the repeated grade are computed in the GPA. Grades that do not count in successful completion Other grades, such as 0.0, I (incompletes); X (grade not submitted); NC (no credit); NS (not satisfactory); E (fail); W (withdrawal ); HW (hardship withdrawal); Registrar Drop (RD) and Audit credits are not considered in the successfully completed credit totals. However, all of these grades are considered in the attempted credits and negatively affect your ability to reach the required credits for the quarterly and annual measurements. These grades are not calculated in the GPA. You should let the financial aid counselors know if you convert an Incomplete or X grade to a passing grade in case that may reinstate your eligibility for the quarter. How to re-establish eligibility If you did not meet the progress requirements because you had special circumstances, you may file an appeal with our office. You will need to demonstrate unusual circumstances beyond your control that are not likely to recur in the immediate future. You will need to explain what has changed in your situation so that you will now be able to make academic progress. Once you have not met the progress requirements and need to file an appeal, you have lost your eligibility for aid and any award you received. If you re-establish your eligibility with a successful appeal, you may not receive the same award as before. Instead, we will award you with the funds we currently have available. Depending upon the time of the quarter, it can take approximately three weeks to receive a decision on your appeal. If you are waiting to hear about your appeal and tuition is due, you need to make sure you pay your own tuition. Do not count on your appeal being approved. If necessary, withdraw by the full refund period or apply for a short-term loan. Emergency provisions Students will not be held responsible for disruption of their academic schedules due to unavoidable situations affecting the campus such as natural disasters, inclement weather, or other circumstances that result in the late assignment of grades. The Office of Student Financial Aid will decide when to invoke this emergency provision. At that time and based on the situation at hand, every effort will be made to determine the progression toward a degree without the availability of grades so students may proceed with their next quarter of attendance. You can review your award notice on MyUW to see what type of aid you have been awarded. Federal aid typically consists of Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Grants (SEOG), Federal Work Study, Federal Direct Subsidized Stafford, Unsubsidized Stafford and Parent PLUS loans. State and institutional aid typically consists of Washington College Grant, College Bound, University Tuition Exemption and University Grant. Back to top Graduate & professional students Graduate students must maintain satisfactory academic progress (SAP) based on federal, state and institutional requirements. This consists of three parts: Complete a minimum of 67% of cumulative attempted credits for federal aid, measured at the end of spring quarter, Program completion within a maximum timeframe, which cannot exceed 105 attempted credits for a master’s program and 285 attempted credits for a doctoral program (including all master level credits earned at the UW). Have a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 or greater at the end of spring quarter as monitored by OSFA. In order continue to be eligible for financial aid, students must meet ALL three requirements. After reviewing the full policy below, students should contact a financial aid counselor if unsure of the requirements for maintaining or reinstating eligibility. Please note that medical, dental, pharmacy and law students’ academic progress for financial aid is monitored by their colleges directly and may have more stringent requirements than described in this policy. Cumulative credit requirement Graduate and professional students must successfully complete a minimum of 67% of the cumulative credits attempted to be on pace to complete their degree within the maximum time frame. To determine if you have met the requirement, total all of your attempted credits at the end of spring quarter. Then add up your completed credits at the end of spring quarter, and divide by the attempted credits. Your percentage of completion needs to meet or exceed 67%. Maximum time frame for degree completion All graduate and professional students are expected to complete their degree program within a maximum time frame, which cannot exceed 150% of the average credits needed to complete the degree program. This means that students in a master’s program have a maximum time frame of 105 attempted credits. Doctoral students have 285 attempted credits (including any UW master and pre-doctoral level credits) in which to complete the degree program. Students who have reached or exceeded the maximum time frame may petition, through the regular appeal process described below, for an extension based on extenuating circumstances which prevented the completion of the degree program within the credit limits above. Minimum grade point average Students must maintain a minimum grade point average (GPA) as established by the University. In general, graduate students must maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA. Please review Memo 16: Unsatisfactory Performance and Progress policy. OSFA will monitor for at least a 3.0 GPA at the end of spring quarter. Passing grades for successful completion Passing grades used to compute completed credits are numerical grades of 2.7 or higher, N (used for hyphenated courses lasting longer than one quarter); S (Satisfactory) or CR (credit) and must be earned in residence at the UW. Residence credits are academic credit for courses offered through the UW Quarterly Time Schedule and certain other approved courses which are listed individually on your UW academic transcript. Repeated credits count only one time in the completed credit total. Repeated courses always count in attempted credits. Both the original and the repeated grade are computed in the GPA. Grades that do not count in successful completion Other grades, such as 2.6 or lower; I (incompletes); X (grade not submitted); NC (no credit); NS (not satisfactory); E (fail); W (withdrawal ); HW (hardship withdrawal); Registrar Drop (RD) and Audit credits are not considered in the successfully completed credit totals. However, all of these grades are considered in the attempted credits and negatively affect your ability to reach the required credits for the quarterly and annual measurements. These grades are not calculated in the GPA. You should let the financial aid counselors know if you convert an Incomplete or X grade to a passing grade in case that may reinstate your eligibility for the quarter. How to re-establish eligibility If you did not meet the progress requirements because you had special circumstances you may file an appeal with our office. You will need to demonstrate unusual circumstances beyond your control that are not likely to recur in the immediate future. You will need to explain what has changed in your situation so that you will now be able to make academic progress. If approved, you will need to meet the requirements of an individual academic plan to continue to receive financial aid. Once you have not met the progress requirements and need to file an appeal, you have lost your eligibility for aid and any award you received. If you re-establish your eligibility with a successful appeal, you may not receive the same award as before. Instead, we will award you with the funds we currently have available.
