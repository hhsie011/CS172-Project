In recent years, however, the number and severity of earthquakes in the state — especially those emanating from the oil and gas fields along the Kansas/Oklahoma border southwest of Wichita — have spiked and appear to be increasing. Nothing approaching a major earthquake has ever originated in Kansas. The largest event in recorded history was a 5.1 magnitude quake centered near Manhattan, Kan., in 1867. That magnitude is considered "moderate" on the Modified Mercalli Scale of earthquake intensity. Despite the low risk of a major event, here are some resources that can help you be better prepared should a large earthquake take place.
