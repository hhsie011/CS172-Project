Candidates should have recently completed their Ph.D. or should expect to complete their degree requirements by September 2022. Researchers at the Observatory work to understand the dynamics of the Earth’s chemical, physical and biological systems, from the core to the upper atmosphere, including Earth’s interactions with human society. Our scientists lead research in the fields of solid Earth dynamics; ocean, atmospheric and climate systems; cryospheric dynamics; paleoclimate; biogeoscience; and geohealth solutions. The principal selection criteria for Fellows are scientific excellence and a clearly expressed plan to investigate problems at the forefront of Earth science. Applications from all related fields are welcome. Fellowships are supported institutionally for 24 months, include a $7,500 research allowance, and carry an annual salary of $66,000. Successful candidates will be encouraged to apply for external funding and may be eligible for further internal awards and positions. Lamont is especially interested in qualified candidates who increase the diversity of the Observatory’s scientific personnel. The deadline for applications is November 12, 2021. We accept online applications only. Contact: The Office of the Director, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University, Palisades, NY 10964 | 845-365-8546 | [email protected] Note: Related postdoctoral opportunities are available at the Earth Institute at Columbia University.
