Online tax forms are legal documents that meet all the same IRS requirements as paper forms, and accessing your tax forms online means more security for you: you never have to worry about your tax forms (and your Social Security number) getting lost in the mail or stolen from your mailbox. Moreover, online tax forms are available weeks before paper tax forms are mailed out in late January – and as an added perk, if you opt out you will be notified via email as soon as your tax documents are ready. In addition to providing a quicker and more secure way to receive your tax filing information, opting out of paper tax forms helps the UW reduce time and money costs, and furthers the University’s goals of creating a greener, more sustainable campus. How To Opt Out Opting out of paper tax forms takes just a few moments: Log into Workday, and from the Pay worklet, select My Tax Documents At the far right of the page, in the Printing Election column, select the Edit button Select the Receive electronic copy of my Year End Tax Documents button, select OK at the bottom of the screen, then select Done You will be able to access your tax documents online as soon as they become available in early January. Opt Out Instructions for International Workers If your work location is outside of the United States, your Workday screen looks slightly different. To opt out of paper tax forms in Workday: From the Cloud icon on the top of the screen, select View Profile Select the Actions button located beneath your name Scroll to Payroll, select Change My Tax Documents Printing Elections At the far right of the page, in the Printing Election column, select the Edit button Select the Receive electronic copy of my Year End Tax Documents button, select OK at the bottom of the screen, then select Done If you previously opted out, thank you! You do not need to do so again.
