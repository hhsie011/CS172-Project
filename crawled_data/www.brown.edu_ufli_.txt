Undocumented, First-Generation College, and Low-Income Student Center The Undocumented, First-Generation College and Low-Income Student Center (U-FLi Center) is a communal, learning, and advocacy center for members of the Brown community who identify with the undocumented, first-generation college, and/or low-income student experience. By providing undergraduate and graduate students with a dedicated space that affirms their intersectional identities, the U-FLi Center aims to contribute to the endurance and success of U-FLi students at Brown University. Who does the center support? While the term "first-generation college student" is defined as a student whose parents did not complete a four-year college education, at Brown we encourage students to think of the term more broadly. We welcome any student who self-identifies as having minimal prior exposure to or knowledge of experiences like those at Brown. For "low-income students," there is no income level that determines eligibility for students to take advantage of the community and programs of the U-FLi Center, though generally engaged students have little or no expected parent contribution as part of their financial aid package. Students who advocated for the inclusion of low-income students in the title of the Center had powerful stories for how their experiences impacted their time at Brown and expressed a desire for increased coordination of support. An "undocumented student" is defined as a student who is not a U.S. citizen or Permanent Resident of the United States, and who does not hold a visa to reside in the U.S. Undocumented students can find information about financial, legal, and emotional support through the Undocumented Student Program of the Center, as well as the Brown Immigrant Rights Coalition. The U-FLi Center also works closely with students who may identify with the "undocu-plus" experience (DACA-mented students, TPS holders, or students from mixed-status families).
