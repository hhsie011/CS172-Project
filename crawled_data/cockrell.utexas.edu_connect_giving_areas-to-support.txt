To build upon this proud tradition, we must provide a best-in-class student experience that sets us apart and strengthens our efforts to recruit high-potential talent in an increasingly competitive market. With your help, we will aim to offer competitive scholarship packages for all qualified students, enhance support structures that guide them throughout their engineering education and invest in engineering student success and leadership programs that develop well-rounded students and prepare them to excel throughout a productive life. Through these efforts, we will continue to have a lasting impact on generations of families through education. Faculty: Recruiting and Retaining the World’s Best Whether in the lab or in the classroom, Texas Engineering faculty members are continually breaking new ground through their innovative research and their excellence in teaching. Their impact extends far beyond our campus, and they represent the very best of The University of Texas at Austin, making it possible for us to attract and educate exceptional students. Investing in faculty excellence elevates the university in remarkable ways by providing a competitive advantage in the talent-recruitment marketplace. Through your gift, you will help us offer compelling recruitment and retention packages to outstanding faculty members as well as additional fellowships that fund crucial graduate student support, enabling the Cockrell School to attract the greatest researchers and teachers from around the world. Facilities: Modernizing to Foster a Stronger Texas Engineering Community When the Cockrell School of Engineering opened the Engineering Education and Research Center — a state-of-the-art hub for engineering education, research and innovation — in fall 2017, we unveiled the physical manifestation of our commitment to multidisciplinary collaboration. In its first year of existence, the building has truly transformed the entire Texas Engineering community, unifying faculty and students from all engineering disciplines. We believe that our facilities should make a strong first impression and strengthen our efforts to recruit prospective students and faculty. They should provide cutting-edge labs, classrooms and meeting spaces that enhance our research and teaching, enabling us to develop new technologies and launch future leaders. Above all, our facilities must reflect our priorities and aspirations for Texas Engineering over the coming decades, contributing to student success and empowering our researchers to change the world. Through renovations to our existing spaces and the addition of the Energy Engineering Building — another new, multidisciplinary facility — we will continue to enhance our engineering campus and build a stronger engineering community.
