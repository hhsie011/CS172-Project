In a landmark judgement for the LGBTQ community, the Supreme Court of India decriminalized the colonial-era Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. Yet, experts have pointed out that decriminalization without equal rights, especially the right to marriage, precludes living a life of dignity and fulfillment. This Pride Month, join Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai, in partnership with the Columbia Alumni Association of India, for a virtual conversation featuring distinguished panelists who will share first hand experiences, unpack the rights and limitations of LGBTQ relationships in India, and propose strategies for availing of networks and services during the coronavirus crisis.
