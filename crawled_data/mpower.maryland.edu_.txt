About MPower Overview Initiatives Leadership Universities University of Maryland, College Park University of Maryland, Baltimore Research University of Maryland Research Enterprise News and Noteworthy News Spotlight In the Press Contact University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State (MPower) is a collaboration between the state of Maryland’s two most powerful public research engines: the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) and the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP) — to strengthen and serve the state of Maryland and its citizens. Since its creation in 2012, MPower has fostered hundreds of collaborations from across both institutions that are growing Maryland’s innovation economy, advancing interdisciplinary research, increasing educational benefits, and addressing the state’s most critical issues. The partnership is delivering on a vision of collaboration, innovation, and transformative impact across Maryland. Working together, UMB and UMCP achieve INNOVATION and IMPACT through COLLABORATION. The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership Act of 2016 strengthened and formalized the structured relationship between UMB and UMCP, which began in 2012. The law deepens the alliance and energizes UMB and UMCP to pursue even greater transformative change and impact, far surpassing what each institution could do independent of each other. The partnership’s most recent achievements can be found in this annual update: Download the 2022 brochure. Implementation of the 2016 Strategic Partnership Act The collaboration between UMB and UMCP has increased substantially over the past five years as the institutions implement the University of Maryland Strategic Partnership Act of 2016. In addition to formalizing the structure, the law has led to more alignment and coordination, and created new units, funded with the generous support of Gov. Larry Hogan and the General Assembly.

In 2012, the University System of Maryland Board of Regents tasked UMB and UMCP with establishing a new working relationship designed to promote innovation and impact through collaboration. Through a set of formal actions referred to as the University of Maryland Strategic Partnership Initiatives, the two campuses are leveraging their considerable strengths to attract exceptional faculty, better serve students, and position the state in a new economic reality. The responsibility for achieving those actions is the responsibility of the Joint Steering Council, whose members have been appointed by the presidents. The Joint Steering Council reports to the two presidents, who have dual authority for resource allocation and oversight over the projects and programs. The presidents report to the chancellor and the Board of Regents on the progress of the new activities.

It is home to 12 colleges and schools offering more than 250 academic programs to 40,000 undergraduate and graduate students. UMCP’s renowned academic community is addressing important scientific and societal challenges, including climate change, the economy, energy, homeland security, and public health. The university partners with governments, major corporations, nonprofit organizations, and educational institutions around the world, and its research brings in more than $540 million in external grants annually. UMCP also cultivates a culture of thriving entrepreneurship, assisting business startups, launching technology ventures, and connecting Maryland companies with university resources to help them succeed. The College Park campus is built around a central mall, anchored by McKeldin Library and the Main Administration Building and surrounded by classroom buildings. In all, the university consists of more than 270 buildings, most of them featuring the red brick and white columns that define Colonial Revival architecture. UMCP is committed to educating exceptional students, conducting groundbreaking research, fostering global connections, and serving as the state’s strongest economic engine. Mission The mission of the University of Maryland, College Park is to provide excellence in teaching, research, and service. The university educates students and advances knowledge in areas of importance to the state, the nation, and the world. The university is committed to pre-eminence as a national center of research and graduate education, and as the institution of choice for Maryland’s undergraduates of exceptional ability and promise. The University of Maryland is a public research university, the flagship campus of the University System of Maryland, and the original 1862 land-grant institution in the state. It is one of 63 members of the Association of American Universities, an organization composed of the leading research universities in the United States and Canada. The university creates and applies knowledge, providing outstanding instruction and nourishing a climate of intellectual growth in a broad range of academic disciplines and interdisciplinary fields. As a land-grant institution, the university shares its research, educational, cultural, and technological strengths with the Maryland citizenry and other constituencies. Its collaborations with state, federal, private, and nonprofit partners promote economic development and improve quality of life. Vital to these activities is the excellence of the university’s faculty, staff, and students. The university counts the diversity of its community as among its greatest strengths. It is committed to diversity and inclusiveness in both educational and work environments. Providing equal educational opportunity; hiring and retaining a diverse faculty and staff of exceptional achievement; and recruiting and graduating talented students from traditionally under-represented groups are institutional priorities. University of Maryland, Baltimore Founded in 1807, the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) is Maryland’s only public health, law, and human services university, dedicated to excellence in education, research, clinical care, and public service. UMB enrolls more than 6,800 students in six highly ranked professional schools — medicine, law, dentistry, pharmacy, nursing, and social work — and an interdisciplinary Graduate School. The University offers 76 degree and certificate programs and confers most of the professional practice doctoral degrees awarded in Maryland. UMB is a thriving academic health center combining cutting-edge biomedical research and exceptional patient care. The university attracted a $664.7 million in grants and contracts last year, and its faculty are among the nation’s most productive researchers, with each tenured/tenure-track faculty member annually bringing an average of $1.36 million in grant funding into UMB — and into Maryland. The 14-acre University of Maryland BioPark, Baltimore’s biggest biotechnology cluster, fuels the commercialization of new drugs, diagnostics, and devices, giving more than 1,000 research scientists and entrepreneurs and nearly 40 early-stage life science companies the space to create and collaborate. As demand for a dynamic innovation district keeps growing, so does the BioPark. At full build-out, it will house 2 million square feet of lab, office, clinical, and classroom space and bring needed retail properties and landscaped parks to West Baltimore. UMB delivers $40 million each year in uncompensated care to the citizens of Maryland. The University’s students, faculty, and staff contribute 2 million hours of service annually, providing programming that improves Marylanders’ health and wellness, advances justice, promotes economic development, and strengthens families and communities.
