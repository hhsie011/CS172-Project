Please check back next semester if you are interested in contributing to The Pulse. “The Pulse strengthened my ability to read and think critically, to keep large projects and groups of people organized, and to bring out the best in others’ writing: all in service of recognizing good scholarship and making it available to the wider academic community. Thus, the Pulse represented a union of theory and practice for me, and inspired me to pursue that union in the other areas of my life as well.” -Kaylie Page, University Scholars, concentrations in Theology and Great Texts, Class of 2018; Editor-in-Chief of The Pulse 2017-2018 Resources & Events Academic Honors Week Laura Jackson Lecture Drumwright Lecture Career Opportunities & Awards Prestigious Post-Baccalaureate Awards Lecture Videos Publications Recent Faculty Books Student Publications The Pulse Marketing Resources Pre-Advising 2022 Meet Your Major Programs Honors College Contact Us ApplyVisitMake a GiftBaylor Interdisciplinary CoreGreat TextsHonors Residential CollegeHonors ProgramUniversity Scholars General Information Colleges, Schools, Libraries & Research Admissions Administration Gateways For...
