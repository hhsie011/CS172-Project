Throughout the crisis, Global Cornell has provided leadership, oversight, and programming to support our international students, scholars, staff, and partners worldwide. Study Away During spring 2020, Global Cornell rapidly created Study Away as a residential option for international students facing visa or travel issues that would prevent them from returning to Ithaca for the fall 2020 semester. Study Away provided a local Cornell community, as well as access to educational facilities, services, and collaborations. Over two semesters, more than 700 of Cornell's international students learned at 10 Study Away locations around the world. Connections in the Time of Coronavirus We asked the Cornell community to share inspiring stories during the early days of COVID-19. Connections in the Time of Coronavirus is a collection of global stories of caring and compassion that demonstrate the power of human connection, even in a time of social distancing.
