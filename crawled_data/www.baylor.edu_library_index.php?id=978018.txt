The tools range from traditional shop class equipment, to cutting edge digital fabrication technology and projects scale from tinkering with pipe cleaners to prototyping a patentable invention that could be brought to market. Learning is formal and informal. The Libraries' Makerspace contains equipment and resources available to faculty, staff, and students for formal, guided projects and informal maker culture. As we work to upgrade the current space, the University Libraries seek dedicated shop space, equipped with tools common to most makerspaces, and essential support staff as well as outreach staff dedicated to: 1. integrating making into curricula with faculty, 2. guided exploration for funded and personal research, and 3. internal/external partnerships and programming, including the Baylor Libraries' literacies initiative. Phase One Upgrade The Experiential Learning Commons team has an opportunity to expand the footprint of the Makerspace into a 20ft x 30ft corner of the Garden Level Study Commons to create a large, instruction-friendly area where faculty could bring classes full of students to participate in making experiences all at once, rather than in small, disconnected sub-groups. This new space would include a project-safe concrete floor, storage cabinets, power supplies from the ceiling for added configuration options, movable partitions, tiered seating and digital displays for instructions and demonstrations. In addition, a space in the area could be created to highlight examples of maker projects, the Libraries’ Book Arts Collection, and other exhibits related to the intersection of technology, making, and scholarship. Specific cost estimates for the project include: Project Need Estimated Cost Floor preparation Storage and workbenches Ceiling power Digital monitors Partitions Tiered seating Tiered power kits Wall treatment Additional making equipment (for sewing, embroidery, vinyl cutting, hand tools, etc.) $5,000 $10,000 $3,000 $4,800 $4,700 $8,000 $2,000 $2,500 $10,000 Total cost estimate $60,000 Phase Two Upgrade To reach the ultimate goal of a comprehensive, free-standing makerspace environment, we estimate an investment of $750,000 for renovation of 7,000ft2 of library space and the addition of new, used, and donated equipment. This phase two upgrade could be completed independently of a phase one step should the suggested funding level be reached in a short timeframe; otherwise, a two-step approach to the complete project is anticipated.
