Our program encompasses two overlapping approaches. Women's Studies emphasizes the intellectual, artistic, political, social, economic, and spiritual contributions of women, which traditional scholarship long overlooked or denigrated. Gender Studies extends the interdisciplinary methods of Women's Studies to a broader range of issues, including the social and cultural meanings of masculinity and sexual identity. Both approaches explore the way that race, class, nationality, religion and other social categories interact with gender and sexuality.
