The board was established to provide guidance and support to the Division of Inclusion and Equity and works to inform faculty and students about global competencies necessary for success in today’s workplace. They provide students with a pipeline of opportunities into their organizations, which are some of America’s most successful corporations. Their kick-off meeting occurs at the Men of Color Summit, allowing them to also meet with students who are exploring career, internships and employment opportunities.
