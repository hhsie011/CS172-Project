In addition, students should submit all of the requested documentation in a timely manner as indicated above. Test Optional Policy Texas Tech University has enacted a test optional admission policy for students applying through the Fall 2025 entry term. This policy allows students the option to apply without consideration of SAT or ACT scores. At the time of application, students will share their plans regarding the submission or consideration of SAT or ACT as part of their application. Students selecting this option will have their application and supplemental information evaluated in a holistic manner. In lieu of these test scores, students are encouraged to submit additional material (detailed in the Supplemental Application Items below) that they feel best highlights their skills, talents, and potential contributions to Texas Tech. Supplemental Application Items Essays using prompts from ApplyTexas or Common App Letter(s) of Recommendation College Transcripts for Dual Credit, AP Exams IB, Exit Exams, any other test scores or certificates Resume Evaluation for Admission If a student wishes to be evaluated under the test optional policy, their application and supplemental information will be evaluated holistically in the following manner: Some applicants may feel the SAT or ACT does not fully reflect their academic performance. These students are strongly encouraged to submit additional documentation that would reflect the items listed above. If a student previously supplied a test score prior to submitting the application and chooses on the application to be reviewed test optional, the test score will not be visible to those reviewing the file for admission. A review committee will examine each applicant's file to identify their achievements and the challenges they faced, hoping to identify the way they took advantage of the opportunities presented to them. The file will be evaluated for intellectual curiosity and academic rigor, demonstrated leadership and problem-solving ability, contributions to community, socioeconomic background and family responsibilities, special talents and awards, and diversity of experience and background. After the holistic review, a decision will be rendered by the review committee for test optional students. If a student was evaluated test optional and denied, the student may choose to submit a test score and request a re-evaluation with the score being considered. Students should contact their International Undergraduate Admissions counselor for information. Test Optional: Scholarship Consideration Texas Tech University is proud to offer a high quality education at an affordable cost. TTU continues to be recognized as a best value university for your return on investment. Students who apply test-optional will be evaluated holistically for merit scholarships. While students may be test optional for admissions, students still have the opportunity to submit test scores for scholarship consideration. We will continue to monitor the ability of SAT and ACT to administer their exams, which can be used for merit scholarship consideration but not always required for competitive-based scholarships. Students are able to submit scores until June 1 of their senior year to qualify for merit scholarships. After that, merit scholarships are available based on availability of funding. Students are considered for competitive-based scholarships with their application for admission. This policy has been approved by the Texas Tech University System Board of Regents (May 2020).
