A Social Impact Practicum (SIP) is a project-based experiential learning opportunity connecting undergraduate courses at Dartmouth with community needs identified by nonprofit organizations throughout the Upper Valley. In other words, a SIP is a real-world project with real-world impact. For more information or to suggest a course that you think could benefit from a Social Impact Practicum, please contact Ashley Doolittle. DCSI also collaborates with Thayer's Senior Design Challenge to match human-centered design projects proposed by Upper Valley nonprofits with this two-term senior-level engineering course.

I will definitely explore [more] of these courses with integrated SIPs in the coming terms.” -Jessica K. ‘17 Main menu Dartmouth College Students | Social Impact About Mission and Vision History Support the Center People Programs & Initiatives For Students Youth Education & Mentoring Programs (YEM) Internships Student Leadership Social Impact Non-profit Consulting (SINC) Immersion Trips Social Impact Practicums (SIPs) Local Volunteerism Post-Graduate Opportunities Schweitzer Fellows Program (SFP) Social Sector Careers Breaking the Mold For Faculty Engaged Scholarship Resources Social Impact Practicums (SIPs) For Community Partners Post an Internship or Volunteer Opportunity Social Impact Practicums (SIPs) Share Your Expertise COVID-19 at DCSI Alumni Alumni Engagement Opportunities Dartmouth Partners in Community Service Support DPCS News & Events Ribbon Footer People Office Manager and Assistant to the Director Cherie Caviness Cherie.L.Caviness@Dartmouth.edu (603) 646-3442 Director Tracy Dustin-Eichler Tracy.L.Dustin-Eichler@Dartmouth.edu (603) 646-0411 Find Us Address Dartmouth Center for Social Impact 6154 South Fairbanks Hall Hanover, NH 03755http://m.dartmouth.edu/map/ Phone: (603) 646-3350 Fax: (603) 646-2645 HB: HB 6154 Email: Center.for.Social.Impact@Dartmouth.edu More Contact Information Connect with Us Facebook YouTube Instagram Close Contact Us My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
