As articulated in the University’s Statement on Diversity and Inclusion, “Princeton University is a community devoted to excellence in education and scholarship. We believe that only by including people with a broad range of experiences and perspectives are we able to realize our potential – to expand our capacity for teaching and learning, to increase opportunities for innovative research, and to equip students for lives of service and leadership in an increasingly pluralistic society. Thus, the goals of excellence and diversity are inextricably linked.” Below are some highlights of the Office of the Dean of Faculty’s focus on faculty diversity and inclusion: Faculty Search Process Presidential Postdoctoral Research Fellows Presidential Visiting Scholars Additional Resources Faculty Search Process Presidential Postdoctoral Research Fellows Presidential Visiting Scholars Program Additional Resources Office of the Dean of the Faculty Princeton University 9 Nassau Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544-5264 Phone: 609-258-3020 Fax: 609-258-2168 Email: dof@princeton.edu Photos: Office of Communications, Denise Applewhite Ask a Question Give Feedback Request Data Rules & Procedures of the Faculty Rights, Rules, and Responsibilities University-Wide Policies Employer Obligation Regarding Records Workplace Notices © 2022 The Trustees of Princeton University
