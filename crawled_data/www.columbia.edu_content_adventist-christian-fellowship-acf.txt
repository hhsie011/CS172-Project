Home Events Leadership Pictures Contact Us Welcome ACF at Columbia University Adventist Christian Fellowship (ACF) at Columbia University is comprised of Christian undergraduate and graduate students who are currently enrolled at the university. The fellowship was started in 2001 by Seventh-day Adventist students at Columbia who wanted to get together regularly to hang out, pray, and study the Bible. Today, the group is comprised of diverse students who are excited about their faith and want to work as agents of positive change in the university, the city, and the world. ACF @ Columbia seeks to provide an environment for students to celebrate, explore, share and grow in their faith in the context of warm Christian friendship. We welcome friends from all backgrounds to join us on our exciting journey! Sign up for ACF emails Copyright Â© 2009 Adventist Christian Fellowship at Columbia University. All rights reserved.
