A broad range of interests and outcomes for OSU Ag Research is key to this mission, because the research ultimately is used throughout the state to provide a safe and affordable food supply; maintain an environmentally sustainable agricultural production system; and preserve precious natural resources for residents’ health and security. It is a community effort – our research is a collaboration between farmers and ranchers, agriculture commodity groups, industry, state agencies and federal competitive grants. Expenditures, which total more than $50 million annually, directly support Oklahoma’s agricultural industry, further driving the need for more research.
