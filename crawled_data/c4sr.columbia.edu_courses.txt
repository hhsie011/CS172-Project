Columbia | Center for Spatial Research Projects News Courses Tutorials Publications People Contact x Close Menu Columbia | CSRCenter for Spatial Research Menu About Projects News Courses Tutorials Publications People The Center for Spatial Research offers multiple semester long courses each year that are open to students from GSAPP and the Arts & Sciences as well as an intensive summer session methods workshop for faculty. Our courses are designed to encourage humanities and architecture scholars and students to integrate data-driven approaches into their teaching and research and to foster a new generation of critically-minded data-literate scholars and data-based scholarship.
