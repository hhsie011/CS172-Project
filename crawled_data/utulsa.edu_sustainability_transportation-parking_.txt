Close Search / Sustainability / Transportation & Parking Transportation & Parking SUSTAINABILITY Sustainability Projects Recycling Initiatives Ways To Conserve Transportation & Parking Classes, Programs & Opportunities Investment Priorities Campus Transportation Initiatives Restricted Parking in order to make the main campus more pedestrian friendly Increased student housing 1934 to 2359 (2009) and in Fall 2010 bed availability of 2517 with paid occupancy of 2461 (without spouse or children) Administrative staff utilize golf cart (mix gasoline/electric) – those used by dining services are electric (8 electric powered golf carts) Electric Golf Cart utilized in Housing with on-board charger may be charged in any outlet (~1-100th of a cent to operate) Hydrogen-powered “Green Machine” golf cart being built by ENS College Students for campus demo use (utilizes hydrogen fuel cell that recharges batteries) Transportation survey initiative in the works to provide information on current mode of transportation for campus community and interest in carpooling Fitness Program changed to sustainable weekly reporting via email and new employee fitness program encourages walking. Bicycle Initiatives Bicycle Loan Program ~ 350 bicycles available and typically 100% are check out- program began the fall semester 2006 under campus security in a racquetball court after request from SA. Built Bike Repair/ Shop Fall 2008 staffed by p-t work-study students open 12pm-6pm M-F (Bikes are purchased by University) – primarily used by students – Minor repair offered for students’ personal bikes. Each rental includes a helmet and bike lock. Increased visibility for sustainable cycling with four main arterial streets surrounding the university, one (3rd street) has signs saying, “Share the Road” and bicycle logo on the pavement. Another (Delaware Ave.) has a dedicated bike lane, logo in the lane, and signs saying “Bike Path.” Tulsa Bike Club available for additional Bike Outings Campus Bike Patrol Program reduces gas burning vehicles on campus – At present, it has seven mounted officers, but the goal in early 2011 is to have at least 3 Officers per shift riding bikes for patrol out of a total of 29 officers (some are being hired). The bikes give us more flexibility to cover areas of the campus that vehicles cannot enter as well as special events when large crowds prohibit the use of cars to traverse the campus. Green Safety – research is demonstrating that patrolling on bicycle has environmental benefits, as well as effectively increasing safety on campus as bikes can reach areas faster than foot patrol and access areas more efficiently than patrols cars due to limited mobility. The response time going through campus, rather than around the roadways, is significant. Eco-friendly police provide models for sustainability lifestyle and ease of interaction with campus community. All Bike Patrol Officers are required to wear helmets. This decreases carbon footprint, decreases expenses for gas within budget and increases visibility of officers. This patrol was implemented during football games fall 2008. 800 S.
