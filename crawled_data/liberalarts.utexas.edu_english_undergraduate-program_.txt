skip to content Menu x Undergraduate Program Undergraduate Program English Welcome to the English major! The English major at UT offers a first-rate education. Our students graduate with a thorough grounding in British, American, and world literature written in English and its cultural and historical contexts, yet our degree plan is flexible enough to allow students to concentrate in other areas of particular interest, such as creative writing or cultural studies. Just as importantly, English majors learn to articulate and defend their ideas, to turn research and critical thinking into cogent arguments, and to express themselves clearly and with style. Many students use the English major as a starting point for their chosen career or for post-graduate education. English majors work in such diverse fields as teaching and education, law, editing and publishing, advertising and marketing, freelance and technical writing, research, corporate communications, and government and public service, including Peace Corps, AmeriCorps, and non-profit organizations.
