Each school or college makes its admission decision based on their unique requirements, needs and priorities, and decisions are communicated by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. The majority of Michigan first-years are admitted to our liberal arts college, LSA. Seven academic units accept first-year applications: LSA; Engineering; Architecture & Urban Planning; Art & Design; Kinesiology; Music, Theatre & Dance; and Nursing. Business is a first-year direct admit unit, which makes offers to first-year students after they have applied to LSA and indicated an interest in Ross, and been admitted to LSA. In addition, Architecture & Urban Planning, Education, Information, and Pharmacy offer First-year Preferred Admission in which accepted students are guaranteed placement in their sophomore or junior years.* And finally, Architecture & Urban Planning, Business, Dental Hygiene, Education, Information, Pharmacy, Public Health, and Public Policy are upper-level admitting units, meaning they accept applications from students in their first year or sophomore year and, if admitted, students cross-campus transfer to that unit. First-year students can also apply to more than one U-M school or college at a time as dual-degree applicants, with certain limitations and guidelines. This allows students to choose paths and majors that reflect their interests and individuality. The best approach is to think about your college aspirations and to explore the best fit for you. Your high school counselor, teachers, family and others can help you reflect on your choices. You can also contact our admissions office or representatives in the schools or colleges for assistance. *Applicants to the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) and the Stephen M. Ross School of Business (for First-Year Direct Admission), if admitted to both units, students will enroll in the Ross School BBA program as first-year students. Students who are admitted to other U-M schools or colleges (such as the College of Engineering) and Ross, will enroll in Ross in their sophomore year through Preferred Admission provided they meet admission requirements after their first-year on campus. Choosing a Major It’s OK if you don’t yet know what your major will be. Many students don't, until they spend time at Michigan exploring the myriad options and resources available to them. Once you are a Michigan student, you will find plentiful academic advising support to help you shape and focus your academic goals. Depending on the school or college to which you are admitted, you will have time to commit to a major and, if you choose, a minor course of study. Many students do not indicate their major until the end of their sophomore year; Art & Design students do not declare a major.
