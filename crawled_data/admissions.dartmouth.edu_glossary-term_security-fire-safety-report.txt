The report includes statistics for the three previous years concerning reported crimes that occurred on campus, in certain off campus buildings or property owned or controlled by Dartmouth College, and on public property within, or immediately adjacent to and accessible from, the campus. The report also includes institutional policies; crime prevention and education programs, including those focused on sexual assault and sexual misconduct awareness; the reporting of crimes; and other safety and security matters. You can obtain a copy of this report by contacting the Department of Safety and Security at 603-646-4000 or the Title IX Coordinator & Clery Act Compliance Officer at 603-646-0922 or by accessing https://sexual-respect.dartmouth.edu/compliance/jeanne-clery-act/annual-security-report.
