We’ll be joined by a trio of accomplished Columbians, Amy Seow ’10LAW (Raison Wines), Icy Liu ’05SEAS (Becky Wasserman & Co.), and Nicole Rolet (Chene Bleu Wines), who have shattered the glass ceiling of an industry that has been dominated by men for centuries. These three women have distinguished themselves in a myriad of ways including, winemaking, importing, management, empowerment, and education. CAA Wine Industry Network Co-Founder, Ken Catandella, will lead a lively and informative discussion about the trajectory of their distinguished careers and of course, wine. Women Leading in the World of Wine is a collaboration between the CAA Wine Industry Network and the She Opened the Door initiative.
