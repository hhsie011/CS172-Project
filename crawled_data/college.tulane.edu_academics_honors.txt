Home / Academics / Honors Scholars Honors Scholars First-Year Honors Scholars will engage in a new, robust series of programs challenging them to define the scholar and leader they want to be during their time at Tulane. Our new scholars will also have several options to live with each other in small communities designed around common academic themes and interests. Through first-year seminars and informal gatherings, first-year students will explore the many opportunities our elite research institution offers them with our most dynamic faculty members as their guides. Upperclassmen scholars will design their own pathways, with guidance from NTC staff and faculty. They can consider some of the world’s biggest challenges through the College Scholars program, contribute to cutting-edge research through the NTC Research Network, serve as an academic mentor, tutor, or campus leader, or pursue a self-designed academic engagement abroad. Our new Office of Fellowship Advising supports scholars seeking prestigious, nationally competitive post-baccalaureate scholarships and fellowships.
