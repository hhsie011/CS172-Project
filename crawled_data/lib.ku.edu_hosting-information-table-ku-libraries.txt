Please note the following guidelines prior to making a request: Student organizations must be registered in Rock Chalk Central to be considered for approval. Commercial solicitation, advertising, or exchange of monetary funds is strictly prohibited. KU Libraries will determine table location and equipment to prevent disruptions to foot traffic and building use. KU Libraries reserve the right to deny any request or to discontinue an event if the activities violate these guidelines or university policies. To request a table display in Anschutz or Watson, contact the operations manager of the location at least one week prior to the tabling event.
