Brown graduate students and undergraduates are welcome to apply to participate in these endeavors, or to explore other fieldwork opportunities. The Institute also has a publication series, Joukowsky Institute Publications, which features some of the most compelling research and events undertaken or organized by faculty and students of the Institute. The Institute's research and projects continue to expand, as we increasingly focus on engaged scholarship, community outreach, diversity programming, and new ways of connecting with archaeologists locally, nationally, and internationally.
