Beyond this, the major allows students not only to shape their own emphasis within it (for instance, history and criticism or screenwriting), but also to take at least one additional course relevant to their emphasis outside the department. Students interested in majoring should familiarize themselves with the major's requirements as well as the department's course offerings and descriptions. To help you with your planning, you may also use our Film & Media Studies Major Worksheet. Majors are required to complete a Culminating Experience. Students intending to pursue a Film and Media Studies major must meet with the department Chair to discuss their planned course of study previous to submitting a plan in DartWorks. When contacting the Chair please copy the department administrator so they can assist you as well. Students may also be double majors. In addition to film and media studies, past students have majored in English, Physics, Environmental Studies, or Linguistics. Although a double major calls for careful organization and planning, your advisor will serve as a helpful resource in this process. For more information on our major requirements, please contact our department administrator.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Film & Media Studies Undergraduate Overview Major, Minor, And Modified Major The Major Major Requirements Culminating Experience Culminating Exp.
