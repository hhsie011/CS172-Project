Integrated Science and Society Woods College of Advancing Studies Summer Session Schiller Institute for Integrated Science and Society Global Public Health and the Common Good Boston College offers an undergraduate minor and a range of courses in Global Public Health and the Common Good through the Schiller Institute for Integrated Science and Society. Our entry-level courses are open to students from across Boston College and are designed to introduce students in any field of study to core concepts in public health. Enrollment in the six-course (18 credit) minor in Global Public Health and the Common Good is by a competitive application submitted in the spring of the freshman or sophomore year. Students accepted into the minor have the opportunity to delve deeply into epidemiology, the core science of public health, and to pursue coursework and research in diverse areas of public health such as infectious disease epidemiology, the epidemiology of cancer, children’s environmental health, environmental epidemiology, nutritional epidemiology, and refugee health. A distinctive future of the minor is its strong emphasis on the ethical, moral, and legal foundations of global public health. The minor provides opportunities for academic and experiential learning, reflection, and service in the United States and overseas. The minor in Global Public Health and the Common Good is open to students with career interests in medicine, nursing, environmental studies, and public health. It will prepare students for postgraduate studies in public health (M.P.H. and Ph.D.) and enrich the education of students headed to medicine, dentistry, and nursing. And because public health is highly interdisciplinary and intersects many fields of human endeavor, the minor is open also to students interested in law, economics, international studies, mathematics, physics, chemistry, the humanities, business, social work, and education.
