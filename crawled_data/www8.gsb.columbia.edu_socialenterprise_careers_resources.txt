The program also facilitates networking opportunities such as the annual Social Enterprise Reception for students and alumni, which typically takes place at the beginning of the spring term, and helps connect MBA students to alumni networks, professionals, and other resources. Student Clubs organize many career events each year related to social enterprise, including annual conferences, alumni and practitioner panels, and social enterprise industry research study sessions with staff from the Career Management Center. Student clubs also organize group discussions and networking opportunities through career interest groups and alumni mentoring activities. The Career Management Center posts job announcements for current students and alumni through the Career Online Information Network (COIN). The Career Services staff frequently forwards job and internship postings, pro bono consulting opportunities, new social enterprise job resources, and notices about relevant career presentations to student listservs. Recruiters can also submit job postings online. The Career Resource Center, located in Uris Hall (Room 1M), maintains a library of resources related to jobs in social enterprise industries. The Social Enterprise Industry Research Guide, updated regularly by the center’s manager, lists books, industry directories, and periodicals on social enterprise careers available at the CRC, as well as web sites, listservs, and organizations relevant to the field. The MBA-Nonprofit Connection (MNC) is a nonprofit organization that identifies jobs and internships for MBA graduates and students in nonprofit organizations across the country, as well as in some international organizations. MNC internship and job postings are available through COIN (for students) and BANC (for alumni). MNC career counseling services are also available to students and recent alumni. Commongood Careers is a nonprofit organization that pairs the talent and energy of MBA students with social sector employers. Commongood circulates monthly newsletters and also provides counseling services to Columbia MBA students. Bridgestar, an initiative of the Bridgespan Group, provides connections and a membership community to explore senior leadership and nonprofit board opportunities in youth development, human services, environmental advocacy, and other types of high-impact nonprofit organizations.
