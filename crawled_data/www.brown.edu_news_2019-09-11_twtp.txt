[Brown University] — Since its launch in the months following the historic 1968 Black Student Walkout at Brown, the Third World Transition Program (TWTP) has remained steadfast in its mission of welcoming new students to the University through workshops and community-building programs that center the student of color experience. Before each new academic year kicks off, incoming first-year students who participate in TWTP spend four days engaging in dialogue and collaborating with peers to examine how their identities, both unique and collective, can advance social consciousness at Brown. The program also introduces students to a network of resources and support structures already in place at the University. In developing a theme for this year’s 50th anniversary program, coordinators from the Brown Center for Students of Color were particularly drawn to TWTP’s past and future and the crucial space the program has carved out for marginalized communities, thus settling on “Homecoming.” The theme, say the organizers, invites participants to return to their roots and remind themselves of who they are and where they’ve come from. “Homecoming” pays homage to decades of student activism, which paved the way for today’s students to create a more inclusive place for all.
