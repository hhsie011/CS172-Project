Lettie Roach Polar climate scientist NASA GISS/Columbia New York City Intro About Me Research Publications Code & Data CV Contact Email Github Twitter Lettie Roach, PhD Polar climate scientist - About Me I am an Associate Research Scientist at the Center for Climate Systems Research, Columbia University based at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York City. I am also a visiting NOAA Climate and Global Change fellow. I am broadly interested in Earth's climate system, with a focus on the polar regions. My research is motivated by a desire to understand the physics of coupled interactions between ice and climate. I typically work with climate models of varying levels of complexity, in combination with observations, aiming to improve climate projections. Research Pancake sea ice floes in the marginal ice zone Marginal ice zone physics The marginal ice zone is a dynamic region between dense interior sea ice and the open ocean. I previously developed a model for the sea ice floe size distribution that allowed interactions between sea ice and ocean surface waves to be represented in climate models for the first time. I am interested in further investigating the complex interactions between ocean surface waves and sea ice in this region, which may lead to enhanced melting and retreat of sea ice in a warming climate. Related publications: Roach, Horvat et al. (2018), Roach, Bitz et al. (2019) Historical and future sea ice change The latest climate models suggest that the Arctic will become practically sea-ice-free before 2050. Future changes in Antarctic sea ice are much more uncertain, as models differ from satellite observations over the recent historical period where observations are available. I have led efforts evaluating Antarctic sea ice in climate models compared to observations. Recent work nudging winds towards values from reanalysis reveals successes and biases in the simulation of historical Arctic and Antarctic sea ice. Related publications: Roach, Dean et al.

I am working on validating and testing a coupled ice sheet configuration for the NASA GISS climate model. Fundamental drivers of sea ice seasonality The time taken for sea ice to retreat from its maximum area to its minimum area each year is significantly longer in the Arctic than the Antarctic. Our recent work using an idealized climate model shows that the explanation for the fast seasonal retreat of Antarctic sea may be simpler than previously thought. Related publications: Roach et al. (2022) Arctic vs Antarctic [source] Drone operations on the PIPERS cruise Integrating observations and models I am committed to integrating observations with models to better understand and predict polar change. I have been fortunate to participate in fieldwork in the Arctic and Antarctic, both great learning experiences that led to new collaborations. Related publications: Roach, Smith et al.

(2018) - Model output CV I came across sea ice and climate science during an undergraduate degree in Mathematical Physics at the University of Edinburgh. My undergraduate research experience motivated me to do a PhD in sea ice modelling, at Victoria University of Wellington and NIWA in New Zealand. Following that, I moved to the US in 2019 for a postdoctoral appointment in the Ice Climate Group (led by Prof. Cecilia Bitz) at the University of Washington in Seattle. 2021- Associate Research Scientist, NASA GISS and Columbia University, NYC, US 2019-2021 Postdoc, Atmospheric Sciences, University of Washington, US 2016-2019 Geophysics PhD, Victoria University of Wellington and NIWA, NZ 2011-2015 Mathematical Physics MPhys, University of Edinburgh, UK Contact Feel free to reach out!
