Data is a core component of the DIAP, as reflected in the Knowledge priority area. Brown committed to clearly define and delineate who is included as a member of a historically underrepresented group (HUG) based on an intersectional framework and in the context of various disciplinary areas and academic fields. Information on the demographics for students, faculty and staff can be found in the Diversity Dashboard. The Campus Climate Survey dashboard provides a summary of the responses from the Brown community. Diversity Dashboard Using tools to search for campus population data enables members of the community to have direct insights into Brown’s progress in diversifying our campus. Campus Climate Surveys Climate surveys provide insights on the campus environment in support of diversity and inclusion efforts.
