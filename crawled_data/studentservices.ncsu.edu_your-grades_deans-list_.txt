Qualifying for the Dean’s List Full-time undergraduate students are placed on the Dean’s List upon meeting one of the following two qualifications: earning a semester average of 3.5 or better on 12 to 14 credit hours of coursework (for which grade points are earned) earning a 3.25 or better on 15 or more credit hours of coursework (for which grade points are earned) Students are not eligible for the Dean’s List in any semester in which they receive an F or IN grade. When IN grades are resolved, however, students who are otherwise eligible will be added retroactively to the Dean’s List for that semester. Dean’s List recognition is noted on the student’s semester grade report and permanent academic record. For more information, review the policy on Academic Honors.
