She studies the effectiveness of simulation-based teaching strategies on improving interprofessional education and collaborative practice among nurses and healthcare professionals. In partnership with Boise State University, Dr. Rossler recently completed testing the effectiveness of a low-cost virtual reality system that allows nurses to realistically work with patients and equipment in a virtual environment. Currently, she is conducting a study to compare simulation teaching modalities to transition newly licensed nurses into practice. Dr. Rossler is also working with Ganesh Sankaranarayanan, PhD, Assistant Director for the Center of Evidence Based Simulation at Baylor Scott and White Health to develop studies on an immersive virtual reality-based experiential learning simulator to improve medication administration, on the use of virtual simulation technology for prevention and early diagnosis of skin cancer, and on the effectiveness of virtual reality simulation on fire safety skills among students. During National Simulation Week in late September 2018, Bianca Castro, anchor and health reporter with KXAS-TV in Dallas-Fort Worth reported on Dr. Rossler's research and our simulation lab, and the story was aired on more than 100 NBC affiliates throughout the country.

Inauguration Ceremony in India of New Simulation Education & Research Centre LHSON congratulated Tomas E. Ceremuga, PhD, CRNA, LTC (ret), ANC, USA for receiving the 2018 Researcher of the Year Award presented by the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists (AANA) Foundation. Dr. Ceremuga is a faculty member for LHSON’s United States Army Graduate Program in Anesthesia Nursing (USAGPAN) "We are incredibly fortunate to have Dr. Ceremuga as one of our esteemed faculty in our program. Our highly trained, educated and successful graduates are a testament of his expertise, dedication and passion for education," said COL Denise M. Beaumont, CRNA, Director of the U.S. Army Graduate Program in Anesthesia Nursing. According to the AANA, the Researcher of the Year Award is named in memory of John F. Garde, a previous Foundation Trustee, AANA Executive Director and charter member of the AANA Foundation. The John F. Garde Researcher of the Year Award recognizes people who have made significant contributions to the practice of anesthesia through research. Dr. Ceremuga received his Bachelors degree in psychology at Youngstown State University and his MSN in Anesthesia Nursing at the University of Akron. He continued his education in the Neuroscience program at the Uniformed Services University in Maryland. He received his PhD in 2003, and then became a biochemistry and pharmacology instructor in the U.S. Army Graduate Program in Nurse Anesthesia at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. A co-worker of Ceremuga admires his service stating, “His research has culminated in twenty-three publications in peer-reviewed journals. Dr. Ceremuga has been selfless in his research activities. For example, he has mentored 108 student nurse anesthetists in implementing all aspects of research. His service to his students and nurse anesthesia make him more than deserving of the John F. Garde Researcher of the Year Award.” Inauguration Ceremony in India of New Simulation Education & Research Centre LHSON extends its congratulations to Bangalore Baptist Hospital (BBH) in Bengaluru, Karnataka, India regarding the grand inauguration ceremony of its new Simulation Education and Research Centre. Over a year ago USAID awarded Dr. Shelby Garner with Baylor University LHSON $652,800 to partner with BBH. The grant funded the construction of a 4-story building with a state-of-the-art Sim Center for nurses and other health professions including housing for 48 nurses at BBH. Dr. Kelly Rossler Received INACSL Poster Presentation Award LHSON attended the International Nursing Association for Clinical Simulation and Learning conference in June 2017.
