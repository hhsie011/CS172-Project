However, the African Development Bank predicts that Africa’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will grow by 3.4% after a 2.1% drop in 2020. Thus African countries remain on an upward growth trajectory. The continent is endowed with human and natural resources as well as ecological and cultural diversity. It also has a significant youthful, educated, and industrious population keen to set up their businesses or seek employment in such thriving ventures. Entrepreneurial support, including educational programs, mentorship, incubation and innovation hubs, research, among others, are critical in harnessing these opportunities.
