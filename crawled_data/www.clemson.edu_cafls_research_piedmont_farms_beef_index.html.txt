The 300 head beef herd functions primarily as a cow-calf operation and supplies cows, calves and finishing animals for grazing, reproduction, fetal programming and nutrition research. The Clemson Bull Test facility is also present at this location and evaluates seedstock for producers across the region. The sheep center currently supports multiple nutrition and tall fescue projects and is also utilized in the teaching programs. The agronomic programs are driven by research funding and involve biomass, sorghum, soybean, corn and small grain production. Multiple facilities are present on the farm which facilitate small plot agronomic research, large scale production and precision agriculture research, replicated paddocks for grazing research, and individual and group feeding facilities for nutrition and growth research.
