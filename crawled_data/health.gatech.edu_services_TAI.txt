Allergen immunotherapy, also known as allergy shots, is a form of long-term treatment that decreases symptoms for many people with allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma, conjunctivitis (eye allergy) or stinging insect allergy. Allergy shots decrease sensitivity to allergens and often leads to lasting relief of allergy symptoms even after treatment is stopped. This makes it a cost-effective, beneficial treatment approach for many people. If traveling abroad is in your future, this clinic offers travel health information and travel vaccinations for students, faculty, and staff. It is highly recommended to schedule your appointment 6 to 8 weeks prior to traveling. Students can also receive vaccinations other than travel vaccinations, including those required for enrollment.
