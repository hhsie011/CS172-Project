Over the years, the Academy has broadened its focus to explore groups that were targeted in the racism and xenophobia of the Nazi and Fascist regimes, and that suffered and died along with the millions of Jews. The series was conceived by Barbara Faedda in 2008 and has been organized by her annually since then. Videos of many of the symposia can be found here below, and talks from the early years of the series are gathered in the Academy's 2016 book, Present and Future Memory: Holocaust Studies at the Italian Academy, 2008–2016.
