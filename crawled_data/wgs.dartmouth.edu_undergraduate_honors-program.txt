About the Honors Program The Honors Program consists of a two-term thesis project, Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies 98 and 99. Students will design their projects in consultation with the faculty adviser who has agreed to direct the thesis. A student must secure an adviser’s preliminary endorsement of their project by May 1st of the junior year, and submit a proposal to the WGSS Faculty Steering Committee for preliminary approval by May 15th of the junior year. Honors thesis candidates must submit a final thesis proposal for the approval of the Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Faculty Steering Committee by the second week of the fall term of the senior year. Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies 98 and 99 carry two credits toward degree requirements but count as only one credit toward major requirements.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Program in Women's, Gender, &amp; Sexuality Studies Undergraduate Overview Major Modified Major Minor Honors Program Honors Thesis Guidelines Past Honors Theses Courses Previous Terms Associated Courses Independent Study Transfer Credit Alumni Stories Tell Us Your News Research Overview Gender Research Institute at Dartmouth Resources News & Events News & Events Annual Stonewall Lecture Past Lecture Series People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
