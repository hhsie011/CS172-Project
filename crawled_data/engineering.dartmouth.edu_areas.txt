Students are encouraged to chart a path that supports their interests, unconstrained by traditional academic boundaries. Both faculty and students draw from these multiple areas of expertise for maximum human-centered impact. Graduate and undergraduate degree programs of study are developed based on each student's background and interests in consultation with their faculty advisor. Dartmouth's integrated structure facilitates cross-disciplinary initiatives and supports a wide range of collaborative programs. Program Areas Biological & Chemical Engineering Using fundamental principles of biology, chemistry, and mathematics, the B&CE Program Area educates innovators in bio-inspired systems, circuits, and processes as well as biotherapies and biofuels. B&CE Program Area Lead: Margie Ackerman Learn More Biomedical Engineering The BME Program Area supports education and discovery in fundamental applied science and engineering, as well as translational science, to address grand challenges in human health. BME Program Area Lead: Ryan Halter Learn More Electrical & Computer Engineering The ECE Program Area draws from expertise ranging from semiconductor devices to advanced communication networks, from self-powered sensors to electric cars, from wearable devices to cognitive medical imaging, and from autonomous vehicles to smart cities. ECE Program Area Lead: Kofi Odame Learn More Energy Engineering The Energy Engineering Program Area educates innovators in energy conversion, storage, transmission, and utilization, the transition to sustainable energy sources, and improving access to and management of energy systems. Energy Engineering Program Area Lead: Lee Lynd Learn More Materials Science & Engineering The MSE Program Area supports education and discovery in fundamental applied engineering as well as translational science in areas such as ice physics, nano- and bio-materials, energy harvesting and storage, and materials modeling. MSE Program Area Lead: Jifeng Liu Learn More Mechanical, Operations & Systems Engineering The MOSE Program Area prepares students to view the world as a series of interconnected systems with various feedback loops where engineers can zero in on bottlenecks and find ways to address them using available tools.
