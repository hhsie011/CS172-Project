We help you balance business knowledge with the development of management and leadership skills. With Full-time, Evening, and Executive programs to choose from, we have a plan that will work for you. Balancing education and professional development, in and out of class What makes Atlanta a considerable option for MBA programs is the way it allows professional life and academic endeavors to seamlessly work together. Pursuing an MBA shouldn’t require taking a step back from professional development outside of class, and in Atlanta that’s far from the case. This city is built to foster the best balance of experience and education MBA students could need — and it does so on a global level. Take a look at recent studies on the development of American cities. You’re guaranteed to run across a reference to Atlanta as one of the fastest-growing cities in the nation, boasting a burgeoning technology sector and a truly diverse group of people who call it home. The city is well on its way to becoming the digital hub of the South. Add on the fact Atlanta is home to a substantial number of Fortune 500 and Inc. 5000 headquarters, and you have a city rivaling the influence of the largest international hubs in the nation. Learning and networking opportunities unlike any other place For MBA students, Atlanta offers a realm of opportunity both during and after completing their degrees. Students work alongside professionals from across the world in the MBA programs here, and they have the chance to gain experience working with industry leaders who have networks spanning the globe. At Scheller, this experience isn’t just an option — it’s a part of the curriculum. Students take part in courses and projects that involve working side by side with international organizations to solve real-world problems. Beyond that, students pursuing these programs do so in the heart of Technology Square, our main campus in Midtown Atlanta.
