UC uses a standard express license model for all graduates of our Venture Lab. Using a standard license enables us to move quickly and allows the start-up to raise external private investment as soon as it is merited. You cannot raise investment dollars unless you have a license to your IP. Express License - highlights: UC does not take an equity position when a company is formed. The IP is owned by UC but is licensed at a fair rate to start-ups, summarized below: Upfront fee of $1,500 Royalty fee of 2% of sales 10% of any sublicensing fees earned Escalating annual license fees beginning Year 3 Fees applied at milestones such as the launch of a non-software product, the issuance of a patent, FDA approval of a new drug, etc. All existing and ongoing costs associated with a patent Success fee up to 1% when a change of control event occurs, such as the company is sold or goes public Express Option - highlights: An option agreement is sometimes used to enable a third party to evaluate the technology and its market potential for a limited time before licensing. Sometimes a license makes the start-up ineligible for certain funding, in which case an option agreement is preferred. The express option model guarantees to the start-up that UC will not market the technology to other companies during this evaluation period, however it is designed to discourage “sitting” on a technology with little movement toward licensing. Terms are summarized below: No upfront fee, royalties, or sublicensing fees Annual fees of $1,500 from Year 3 through Year 5; $5,000 at Year 6 and beyond A fee of $5,000 for each issued US patent deferred until license Ongoing foreign costs associated with a patent Success fee of 0.5% when a change of control event occurs, such as the company is sold or goes public 1819 Innovation Hub 2900 Reading Rd Cincinnati, OH 45206 513-556-5511 UC Tools Canopy & Canvas One Stop Email Catalyst Shuttle Tracker IT Help UC VPN Bearcats Landing About Us Maps & Directions Jobs News Diversity Governance & Policies Directory Events Calendar University of Cincinnati | 2600 Clifton Ave. | Cincinnati, OH 45221 | ph: 513-556-6000 Alerts | Clery and HEOA Notice | Notice of Non-Discrimination | eAccessibility Concern | Privacy Statement | Copyright Information © 2020 University of Cincinnati 1819 Innovation Hub 2900 Reading Rd Cincinnati, OH 45206 513-556-5511 © 2020 University of Cincinnati scroll up to the top
