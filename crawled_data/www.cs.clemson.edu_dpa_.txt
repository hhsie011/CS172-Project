The DPA program offers a unique blend of instruction from art, computer science, computer engineering, graphic communications, performing arts, philosophy, and psychology, together with newly designed courses targeted at production techniques specific to the animation, visual effects, and electronic games industries. Because the MFA is a terminal degree in fine arts, students will also be prepared to accept university faculty positions. The M.F.A. requires 60 credit hours including a MFA thesis. The GRE is no longer required for the MFA. More info Master of Science in DPA The Master of Science (MS) in Digital Production Arts (DPA) Program, offered since 2017, is a technical professional degree aimed at producing graduates who intend to seek employment in the software development of the electronic arts industry. Its focus includes the technical components of visual effects production for the film, electronic games, and commercial video industries. The MS in DPA is designed primarily to attract technically-minded students interested in learning applied technical knowledge and gaining the related experience to become competitive and pursue employment as a 3D graphics programmer, software engineer, tool builder, and/or technical director in the digital production entertainment industry, but interest may also include related fields, such as commercial virtual reality, 3D printing, and visualization. While the GRE is required for the MS, a portfolio submission is optional. More info Minor in DPA The undergraduate minor in Digital Production Arts (DPA) is designed so that students receive significant training across the artistic and technical disciplines that underlie computer animation, visual effects, computer games, graphics and animation production that incorporates the industry-standard application Maya. The Minor also features two-semester course sequences that teach computer scientists and engineers relevant foundation concepts in art, and that teach artists and architects relevant foundation concepts in computer science and mathematics. Students in other majors complete a subset of these courses. The Minor assists the student to develop the entry-level artistic and technical expertise necessary for effective production of 3D computer graphics and animation. It is especially well suited for students wishing to pursue graduate study in Digital Production Arts. More info and program requirements All programs are offered within the Division of Visual Computing in the School of Computing, with significant collaboration with the departments of Art and Performing Arts. Each offers a unique blend of instruction, with coursework ranging from the artistic to the technical, all with a strong emphasis on advanced studio methods for visual problem solving. Students in the MFA and MS can choose to study in Clemson or Charleston, SC. SHOWCASE Check out some of our latest videos.
