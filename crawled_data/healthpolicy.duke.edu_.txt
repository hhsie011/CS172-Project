Health reform problems are among the most complex and pressing of the 21st century, and future health care leaders must have both technical knowledge and the ability to work and lead across a broad range of perspectives to succeed. Learn More Duke-Margolis is dedicated to improving health and the value of health care for all. Philanthropy from individuals, foundations, and corporations is critical to our ability to educate tomorrow’s health policy leaders and provide evidence-based health policy solutions that affect how health care is delivered, financed, and regulated. Gifts for our priority areas of students, faculty, research and unrestricted Center support are meaningful investments in our work to improve health and health care in communities in North Carolina, across the nation, and around the world.
