Courses have been chosen to allow exploration of multiple perspectives on the dynamics of urban change, the causes of urban problems, and the sources of urban innovation. Special emphasis is given to the physical development of communities, and the interaction of that development with the social, economic, and environmental wellbeing of communities. The curriculum considers theories, ideologies, and practices to support solutions to urban and regional problems and offers students opportunities to engage in addressing local challenges with community partners. This course of study prepares students for pursuit of a professional master’s degree in a related discipline (e.g., City Planning, Public Policy, Public Administration, etc). General Education (35-41 hours) See University General Education Program for the University General Education Program requirements. Students who have completed one year of American History in high school are exempted from the six credit-hour History General Education Program requirement; otherwise, students will have to meet the History requirement.
