Energy Resources Engineering Overview About Us Admissions Undergraduate Program Coterminal MS Program Graduate Program Current Student Resources Courses Alumni Programs Research Groups Events Professional Education Careers Publications Thesis Database News Graduate Program The Energy Resources Engineering curriculum provides a sound background in basic sciences and their application to practical problems to address the complex and changing nature of the field. Course work includes the fundamentals of chemistry, computer science, engineering, geology, geophysics, mathematics, and physics. Applied courses cover aspects of energy resources engineering in fields like oil and gas recovery, geothermal engineering, carbon sequestration, clean coal and renewable energy. The curriculum emphasizes the fundamental aspects of fluid flow in the subsurface of the Earth. These principles apply to optimizing oil recovery from petroleum reservoirs and remediating contaminated groundwater systems. The program also has a strong interest in renewable energy, global climate change, and CO2 sequestration. The Energy Resources Engineering department offers two distinct degree programs at both the MS and PhD levels. One program leads to the degrees of M.S. or Ph.D. in Petroleum Engineering, and the other leads to the degrees of MS or PhD in Energy Resources Engineering.
