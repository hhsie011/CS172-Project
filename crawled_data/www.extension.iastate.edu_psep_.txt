Commercial and Private Pesticide Applicator Testing for Certification The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship is resuming in-person testing sites to help commercial and private pesticide applicators obtain their certifications. For all testing information go to The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship’s Applicator Licensing & Certification page (https://iowaagriculture.gov/pesticide-bureau/applicator-licensing-certification). Pre-registration is required to take the exam. Applicants can either mail their test results, training and application forms, and payments to the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship’s Pesticide Bureau or use the Self-Service Portal to obtain the private or commercial applicator certificate. Register for the Self-Service Pesticide Portal In April, the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship launched an online, self-service portal. The portal uses each pesticide applicator’s unique certification number to match their application and payment to their training and testing history. By moving the process online, individual pesticide applicators can access their records anytime by logging into the self-service portal. The system also has a public search function that empowers customers and employers to verify that their pesticide applicators are licensed to work in the state of Iowa. To register for the self-service portal, visit iowaagriculture.force.com/pesticideapplicator/s/login/SelfRegister.
