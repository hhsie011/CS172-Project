Wharton’s Management Department applies basic social science disciplines and research methods to these management and leadership problems in the public and private sectors. The Management Department encompasses five major areas of expertise: Strategic Management emphasizes forecasting, planning and control, allocating resources, the appraisal of competition, and implementation strategies. Multinational Management focuses on operating in worldwide and heterogeneous national environments under conditions of economic and political risk. Human Social Capital focuses on work and employment, the policies and practices associated with the management of employees, why and how they evolve over time, and what they mean for organizational performance, individual outcomes, and social impact. Organizational Behavior examines employees’ individual and group behavior and how these dynamics influence their attitudes and performance, as well organizational performance and structure. Entrepreneurial Management provides individuals with skills, analytical tools, and concepts to prepare them for a career as an autonomous entrepreneur, a family-business owner, or an innovator in new corporate ventures.
