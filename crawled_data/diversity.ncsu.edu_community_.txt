Creating Community The Office for Institutional Equity and Diversity wants to send a strong message that everyone is welcome at NC State. We do this through our campus community centers, committees and affinity groups. All students, faculty and staff get the opportunity to engage with these entities, in order to grow both personally and professionally. This helps cultivate a community in which individuals demonstrate respect toward one another. Our community efforts also play a role in increasing participation, retention, and success of students, faculty, and staff from historically underrepresented groups. They ensure that NC State is an equitable and inclusive environment, one that is free from prohibited discrimination and harassment. Together, creating community provides a unified, campus-wide approach to ensure that students, faculty and staff learn and work within a campus defined by the best practices in equity, diversity, and inclusion. Our Campus Community Centers African American Cultural Center We form community by promoting awareness of and appreciation for African American and other African descent experiences.
