Panhellenic Sorority Fall Recruitment: August 26-28, 2022 Panhellenic Sorority Recruitment at The University of Tulsa is a fully structured, 3-day process in which potential new members (PNMs) meet current members of all 6 Panhellenic chapters and learn more about sorority membership. Each participant is connected to a recruitment counselor, who serves as a resource and mentor throughout the experience, as well as with a group of peers who will navigate the process together. Participating in the recruitment process does not require a person to join a chapter, but enables them to explore and learn more about the campus and Greek community. This is a great way to meet new people and find out about different ways to get involved on campus!
