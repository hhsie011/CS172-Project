The project documents Ledare’s commission by a respected writer to take a series of erotic photographs of her over the course of a week. Ledare redacted any evidence of the woman’s identity and superimposed the photograph onto an enlarged copy of the front page of The New York Times corresponding to the day the photograph was taken. He added handwritten text to the bottom of the print - a personal journal entry of sorts commenting on the project and the fuzzy line between privacy and publicity. Each print is accompanied by a laserjet printed copy of the contract between Ledare and his subject protecting her and her family’s anonymity. This project was previewed in the artist's second solo exhibition, An Invitation, at Pilar Corrias Gallery in London from May 24 - June 21, 2012. Following this venue, the installation in its entirety was presented in Ledare’s first solo institutional exhibition at Wiels Centre d’art contemporain in Brussels from September 8, 2012 - December 2, 2012. The work has also been exhibited by Kunsthal Charlottenborg in Copenhagen. Ledare’s projects have been exhibited extensively in the US and abroad including at The Art Institute of Chicago (2017); The Box, Los Angeles (2017); Office Baroque, Brussel. His work has also been included in numerous group exhibitions including the Whitney Biennial (2017), The Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; and Manifesta 11, Zurich (2016). Ledare’s work is in the public collections of The Museum of Modern Art, New York; The Art Institute of Chicago; The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; The Hessel Museum of Art, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, New York; The Centre Pompidou, Paris; and Fotomuseum Winterthur, Switzerland. In 2017 Ledare was awarded a John Simon Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship.
