Why Recruit Columbia Talent? Employment Reports Contact Us With hundreds of companies recruiting our students each year, the multitude of options available during recruiting season can become unwieldy. By getting the word out about the opportunities your company is offering and the type of candidates you are seeking, you are more likely to attract applicants that are a good fit for your organization. E-mail You may send one group e-mail message per event to all members of the targeted class by directing the message to one or both of the following addresses. Please inform your account manager when sending emails to the listservs below. Year Description Email Class of 2023 Entire Class [email protected] Class of 2024 August Entrants only* [email protected] Class of 2024 January Entrants only [email protected] *In the fall semester, only e-mail First-Year August Entrants. Calendar When you schedule a company event through the Career Management Center, we will add it to the student event calendar. Please be sure to submit a descriptive publicity paragraph for the calendar. Clearly, the sooner we have this information the better for students. However, try not to promote a division or functional discussion that students may not be able to attend. Calendar listings should include the following information, as applicable, about the presentation: Appropriate attire Divisions presenting Speakers’ names (including, if alumni, year of graduation from Columbia Business School) Complete industry and functional focus represented Job location(s) RSVP details Indicate any permanent work-authorization requirements for full-time or summer internship positions If you will review résumés from all interested students regardless of permanent work authorization, be sure to include this in your publicity Corporate Sponsorship When you sponsor activities on our campus, your company benefits in a number of ways, including by raising your profile in the Columbia Business School community. That gives you a leg up in recruiting our exceptional, diverse student body. If your firm is interested, our Corporate Relations and Career Management Center teams can work with your organization to determine which types of sponsorship best meet your specific goals. Visit the Classroom One of the best ways to get a recruiting edge with our students is to engage with them in the classroom. There, you’ll be able to have an intimate, frank conversation on the issues facing business today. You’ll be able to provide insights that allow students to see theoretical concepts at play in the real world. You also give current students a firsthand look at their post-MBA possibilities. Not to mention, you’ll build close ties with our leading-edge faculty members, whose work continually drives current business practice.
