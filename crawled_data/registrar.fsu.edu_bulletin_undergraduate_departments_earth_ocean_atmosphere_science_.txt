Krishnamurti, T.N. Krishnamurti, Landing, Loper, Marcus, Nof, O’Brien, Odom, Parker, Pfeffer, Staley, Sturges, Thistle, Weatherly, Winchester, Wise In 2010, the departments of Geological Sciences, Oceanography, and Meteorology merged to form the department of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Science (EOAS). While retaining their perspective programmatic focus, the geology, oceanography, and meteorology faculty offer a new level of interdisciplinary integration. This creates fresh opportunities for undergraduate and graduate education in the geosciences. The department provides students with an opportunity for holistic study of Earth’s physical environment in preparation for professional careers in government, private, and academic sectors. Due to concerns about climate change, environmental sustainability, availability of natural resources, and environmental pollution and degradation, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects an overall 5-7% increase in geoscience-related occupations between 2019 and 2029, which is the average growth rate for all U.S. occupations. The opportunities for study and the degree requirements are described below: a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science and Policy a Bachelor of Science in Geology a Bachelor of Science in Meteorology FSU Teach Geoscience Program (BS) FSU Teach Environmental Science Program (BS) The Department of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Science maintains the resources of the three original departments. Our oceanography and meteorology programs are among the leading programs in the country. Our meteorology program is the flagship program in the southeastern United States and is considered to be one of the top five comprehensive meteorology programs in the nation. Research programs may be conducted within the department, or they may involve collaborative work with members of the departments of Physics and Chemistry, the College of Engineering, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Institute, the Department of Scientific Computing, the Center for Ocean and Atmospheric Prediction Studies, and the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. Within EOAS, the Geology department conducts cooperative programs with the Florida Geological Survey, Northwest Florida Water Management District, Florida Department of Environmental Protection, Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, and the United States Geological Survey. The Florida Climate Center and Office of the State Climatologist are housed in the department and are equipped with archives of Florida weather and climate records. An instrumentation facility is also housed in the department, including data loggers and a variety of modern and historical instruments, and a rooftop meteorological tower for real-time local observations. The National Weather Service Forecast Office, located in the Love Building, facilitates interactions between students and professional operational forecasters. The department has a complete television studio equipped with state-of-the-art broadcasting technology, where students prepare weathercasts for class (MET 3940) and for regular broadcasts on Florida State University’s cable television channel, which is seen in surrounding counties and streamed over the Internet. Students often use this experience to develop internships with television stations and to gain employment. Other internship opportunities through private companies or state, local, or federal agencies also are possible. In particular, partnerships and internships with the headquarters of state government agencies located in Tallahassee continue to offer opportunities for our students. Available for use on student projects is a full array of equipment for investigating radon and radium in the environment, and three mass spectrophotometers capable of measuring stable isotope ratios. The department has equipment for investigating carbon dynamics including greenhouse gasses in the laboratory and the field. The geochemistry program at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory has facilities to measure trace level concentrations of most elements of the periodic table as well as measure the isotopic composition of many stable and radioactive elements. These capabilities allow researchers to fingerprint the sources of different elements in the environment as well as to trace chemical processes. Students and faculty have access to five different types of mass spectrometers to take measurements based on their area of specialization. The laboratories also include a “clean lab” which allows processing of small samples as well as determining concentrations at very low levels. The department also houses a large array of equipment for investigation of microbial ecology including equipment for the cultivation of anaerobic microorganisms. Graduate Study in Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Science Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Science offers the Master of Science (MS) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Geology, Meteorology, and Oceanography, a non-thesis Master of Science in Aquatic Environmental Science, and a Professional Science Master’s in Aquatic Environmental Science, a Law and Aquatic Environmental Science and a Physical Environmental Science PhD program. Undergraduates interested in Oceanography or Geology graduate degrees will find the Environmental Science BS degree excellent preparation for graduate study. Students may choose a specific area of emphasis including geology (coursework will permit graduates to take the examination leading to Professional Geologist Certification), environmental engineering, biogeochemistry, atmospheric science, or marine biology. Environmental Science Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Science offers two degrees in Environmental Science. Environmental Science is the interdisciplinary study of environmental systems from a scientific perspective. Drawing principally from the areas of oceanography, geology, and meteorology, the Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science will prepare students in the broader and technical area of geoscience where the greatest expansion in employment opportunities is predicted. It is an attractive option for students seeking a broader interdisciplinary major with the rigor of mathematics and the physical sciences at its core. The BS degree will provide a strong basis for graduate study in environmental and earth sciences. The department also offers a Bachelor of Science degree in Environmental Science and Policy. This degree differs from the traditional BS degree in lower-level mathematics requirements and a greater emphasis on policy. These programs aim to prepare exceptionally well-qualified graduates equipped to work in the interdisciplinary earth sciences, whether in government agencies, NGOs, or the private sector. For additional information, see the department’s Website at https://eoas.fsu.edu/. Geology Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Science offers the Bachelor of Science (BS), Master of Science (MS), and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in geology. Emphasis is on fundamental applications of chemistry, physics, biology, and the scientific method in the study of the earth; field experience is also stressed. Faculty members offer coursework in many areas of surficial, tectonic, environmental, and stratigraphic geology; hydrology; and geochemistry. The major program is intended to provide a well-rounded introduction to the study of the Earth as well as to prepare the student for more advanced study in the fields of natural resources, environmental planning, oceanography, geophysics, and other earth science specialties. Various scholarships are offered (and part-time work is available) within Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences, with the Florida Geological Survey of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and with other agencies of the state and federal governments. Honors in the major can be earned by talented juniors and seniors by engaging in an independent project ending in an honors thesis. For requirements and other information, see the “University Honors Office and Honor Societies” chapter of this General Bulletin. Meteorology Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Science offers the Bachelor of Science (BS), Master of Science (MS), and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in meteorology. By tradition, meteorology is divided into four branches: physical, dynamical, synoptic, and applied meteorology. Physical meteorologists deal with such areas as the physics of rain formation, atmospheric electricity, and radiative transfer and remote sensing. Dynamical meteorologists work in such areas as the mathematical representation of atmospheric flow patterns and the numerical prediction of these patterns. Synoptic meteorologists are involved with the description of atmospheric disturbances and with weather forecasting. Applied meteorologists deal with the application of meteorological and climatological knowledge to such areas as agriculture, architecture, ecology, and air pollution. The undergraduate program provides a broad overview of these branches of meteorology while graduate students are encouraged to specialize in one of them. Meteorologists are needed in research, forecasting, and operational positions to study, interpret, and predict weather and climate processes and patterns and to relate these to human activities. Severe storms, floods, droughts, and air pollution are examples of atmospheric phenomena, which influence health, transportation, agriculture, and business activities. Computer Skills Competency All undergraduates at Florida State University must demonstrate basic computer skills competency prior to graduation. As necessary computer competency skills vary from discipline to discipline, each major determines the courses needed to satisfy this requirement. Undergraduate majors in applied geosciences/FSU-Teach satisfy this requirement by earning a grade of “C–” or higher in ISC 3523C. Undergraduate majors in environmental science and environmental science and policy satisfy this requirement by earning a grade of “C–” or higher in BSC 2010L. Undergraduate majors in geology satisfy this requirement by earning a grade of “C–” or higher in CGS 2060. Undergraduate majors in meteorology satisfy this requirement by earning a grade of “C–” or higher in MET 3220C.

Bachelor of Science in Meteorology The department offers a degree program that prepares students for a diverse number of careers, as well as graduate school. It is highly recommended that students meet regularly with their assigned academic advisor to tailor electives to the students’ goals. Please review all college-wide degree requirements summarized in the “College of Arts and Sciences” chapter of this General Bulletin. A detailed handout for meteorology majors entitled Undergraduate Program in Meteorology is available at https://www.eoas.fsu.edu/. Meteorology is a quantitative science requiring extensive preparation in mathematics and physics. Freshmen entering the program are urged to take as many advanced placement (AP), College-Level Exemption Program (CLEP), or other exemption examinations as they can in order to realize maximum flexibility. Meteorology majors are required to complete a graduation check with the academic coordinator at least one semester prior to graduation. Graduating students also must complete a written exit survey in their final semester, and if possible, an exit interview with the departmental representative. This interview will discuss information provided from the written exit survey. The College of Arts and Sciences will not approve graduation without receiving the written exit survey. Coursework and Requirements Required meteorology coursework. MET 2101, 2507C, 2700, 3220C, 3300, 4301, 4302, 4420, 4450, 4500C, and 4501C. Required courses in mathematics begin with MAC 2311 and its prerequisite courses, MAC 1114 and MAC 1140 or 1147. The following courses, required of all meteorology majors, constitute a minor in mathematics: MAC 2311, 2312, 2313; MAP 2302 or 3305. MAP 3306 or 4341 is strongly recommended for those students wishing to attend graduate school. All students must complete CHM 1045 and 1045L, STA 3032 or STA 4321, PHY 2048C, and PHY 2049C and are encouraged to take PHY 3101. While PHY 3101 is optional, it strengthens one’s background for MET 4450 and with PHY 2048C and PHY 2049C qualifies one for a physics minor. Computer science has arranged for a special optional minor for meteorology majors. Their general minor is recommended for anyone considering additional work in computer science. See the “Computer Science” section of this General Bulletin for details. Students wishing to pursue a career as a meteorologist with the federal government should study https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-standards/1300/meteorology-series-1340/ for the Government’s definition of a meteorologist to help them pick electives to maximize their opportunities. Academic Performance All 2000- and 3000-level meteorology courses must be completed with a grade of “C” (2.0) or better to continue to the 4000-level major coursework. All other required meteorology, mathematics, chemistry, and physics courses must be completed with a “C minus” or better before taking a course for which the technical course serves as a prerequisite. Students earning less than the necessary grade in one of these courses will be required to retake the course until the required standard is met. Retaking a course often delays graduation by one year. A student who has received more than three unsatisfactory grades (U, F, D minus, D, D+) in courses required for the major, excluding Terms 1-4 Common Program Prerequisite courses, taken after enrolling at FSU, will not be permitted to graduate with a degree in Meteorology. Exception to this policy or reinstatement requires a petition to the meteorology faculty. A grade point average of at least 2.0 is required for all meteorology courses numbered 2000 or higher. No more than a total of three S/U-grade only MET prefix courses may be used for the total semester hour requirement for a degree in meteorology. Undergraduate Research All students, particularly those interested in graduate school, are encouraged to volunteer to assist with research in a faculty member’s lab. This work requires a substantial time commitment and typically involves computer skills that are learned and polished through this experience. Qualified students can use this as the basis for an Honors in the Major senior thesis; for more information, see the chapter in this General Bulletin titled “University Honors Office and Honor Societies.” Dr. Ahlquist is the honors liaison for meteorology. Several of our undergraduates have won the American Meteorological Society Macelwane Award for their undergraduate research, and most were not in the Honors in the Major program. In that case, they can register for MET 4905 Directed Individual Study (DIS) credit, but that is not required. Requirements for a Minor in Meteorology A minor in meteorology requires at least twelve credit hours and must be discussed on an individual basis with a meteorology faculty advisor or academic coordinator. The minor typically begins with MET 1010, MET 1010L, MET 2700, and MET 2101, and options exist for the completion of the minor. MET 2700 has prerequisites of CHM 1045, CHM 1045L, and MAC 2311; and a corequisite of PHY 2048C. Additional information is available from the academic coordinator for the Meteorology Program, 2019 EOA Building. In no case may more than three semester hours in S/U courses apply toward a minor in meteorology.
