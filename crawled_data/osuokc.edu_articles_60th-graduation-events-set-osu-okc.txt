First, on May 7, an informal drive-through Car-mencement will be held on campus from 11 a.m. to noon. Faculty and staff members will cheer graduates along the parade route through the parking garage. Participants will get an OSU-OKC goody bag and can stop at the orange dot for a picture with President Scott Newman. Caps and gowns are not required at this event. The following week, from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Friday, May 13, graduates will be honored in a traditional graduation ceremony at Jim Norick Arena, 333 Gordon Cooper St. “We’re excited to be back to a more traditional graduation ceremony, just in time for our 60th anniversary,” said Newman. “We proudly launch these students into their future with a ceremony that pays homage to their past, present and future.” Newman noted many of these graduates have attended college at one of the most tumultuous times in recent history. “I applaud these graduates for their tenacity and courage as they forged through uncertain terrain to get to this place of celebration,” Newman said. “We at OSU-OKC are proud to be part of their journey, which I believe will continue from here to even greater accomplishments.” OSU-OKC students, faculty, staff and guests are invited to the event, celebrating OSU-OKC’s graduating students. Caps and gowns are required for graduates at this ceremony. The keynote speaker for the graduation is entrepreneur and philanthropist Philip Erdoes. Erdoes (OSU ’85) is CEO of the New Traditionalists, a US furniture manufacturer, as well as Chairman and CEO of Bear Cognition, a data analytics company. He is also managing partner of Last Rodeo Studios, a film production and investment entity, and Bear Ventures, which invests in a broad range of industries, including tech, manufacturing, design, media, analytics, and logistics. The Erdoes family has established an ongoing scholarship fund for the OSU-OKC President's Leadership Council. He will be joined by student speaker Anna Milnes. Milnes is a single mom from Yukon who co-founded OSU-OKC’s Single Parents Association, for which she also served as vice president and president. She will be graduating from OSU-OKC with a degree in Cardiovascular Sonography with a position lined up post-graduation. The graduation on May 13 will be live-streamed at https://insideosu.com/.
