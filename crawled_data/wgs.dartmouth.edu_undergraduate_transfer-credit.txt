Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Transfer Credit Policies To receive credit, a transfer course must be equal to the amount of coursework required by a Dartmouth course. For example, the reading requirements for a typical Dartmouth WGSS course is 7-10 required books per ten week term, and a reading packet of 300-500 pages. Most Dartmouth WGSS courses have a combination of several writing assignments and exams as well as a final project/paper. Before Going on Leave Term You must get a pre-approval from the Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Program by providing a detailed course description. Approval is conditional, depending on the final syllabus, and other course requirements.

Only after you have submitted the appropriate documentation will the Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Program review your course and approve it. While on Leave Term Make sure you save the syllabus and any other course-related documents you receive while you are taking the course If your documentation is limited, you’ll need to submit a written report including all of the information below.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Program in Women's, Gender, &amp; Sexuality Studies Undergraduate Overview Major Modified Major Minor Honors Program Honors Thesis Guidelines Past Honors Theses Courses Previous Terms Associated Courses Independent Study Transfer Credit Alumni Stories Tell Us Your News Research Overview Gender Research Institute at Dartmouth Resources News & Events News & Events Annual Stonewall Lecture Past Lecture Series People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
