6:00 PM Columbia Global Centers | Beijing, No. 26, 1F Core Plaza, 1 Shanyuan Street, Zhongguancun, Haidian District, Beijing On November 16, Columbia Global Centers | Beijing and Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation invite you to join us at the second event of Role Play organized by GSAPP alumni, focusing on architectural practices based in Beijing. Role Play focuses on the professional lives of Columbia GSAPP alumni in China through a series of conversations. Today's practices in the fields of architecture and urbanism are no longer restrained to their traditional roles, instead pursuing a range of paths that explore alternative projects and roles. These professionals translate and apply architectural knowledge to other fields, industries, and discourses. This type of role play, in turn has enriched and made more complex the discussions on architecture, urbanism and beyond. As a laboratory of architectural experiments, China helps to catalyze such processes, in which Columbia GSAPP alumni play a central role. This series of conversations allows participants to present their professional paths and experiences, while a concluding roundtable discussion further examines how the role of the architect evolves and transforms through time and practice, and how architectural knowledge is being translated into other fields and industries in China. This year, as the second event of Role Play Series, the round table discussion will be organized around two topics: Environmental Preservation and Cultural Preservation in urban practices.
