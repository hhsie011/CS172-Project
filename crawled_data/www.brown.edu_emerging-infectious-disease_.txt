Image: Mike Savaria About Us Emerging infectious diseases are a growing threat and present major challenges to communities worldwide. The Emerging Infectious Disease Scholars (EIDS) program of Brown University recognizes the specialized research and educational needs that are essential to nurture future healthcare providers so they are well equipped to prevent and manage epidemics. The EIDS program is designed to inspire, train, support, and retain students as a community of scholars to become leaders in research and treatment of emerging infectious diseases. Emerging Infectious Disease Scholars participate in a clinical research project guided by a primary mentor. Scholars participate in journal clubs and research seminars with faculty guidance and peer support, as they develop, implement, and publish their research projects. The EIDS program invites guest speakers, offers field trips, and facilitates networking events to build outreach opportunities for scholars. Scholar Track- Potential research stipends are provided to carry out an infectious disease focused mentored research project usually carried out over the summer. For most students stipends are set at $3750. For PCPM students, research stipend costs can be covered by EIDS. Please note for all students, only one research stipend can be awarded at a time. EIDS support can not be combined with other internal Brown research funding (UTRA, SC, SRA, PCPM) Fellowship Track- A limited number of longer-term opportunities to pursue more in-depth research projects are available, with up to one year of support. Eligibility: EIDS is open to AMS medical students, including PCPM, SPH graduate students, PLME students, and 5-year MPH students. Limited slots are available for undergraduate students (concentrators within the Program in Biology or SPH) with a strong interest in infectious diseases. The EIDS program is grant funded through the National Institutes of Health: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (R25AI140490).
