That may seem self-evident, but combined with life-cycle thinking it means an opportunity to reduce manufacturing emissions, energy consumption, transportation, and even raw materials extraction associated with whatever object we didn’t need. “Reduce, reuse, recycle” remains a powerful hierarchy of solid waste management, but there are even more details of product and materials management, economics, and urban ecology that can receive both our research attention and our operational attention. Status updates Quarterly status reports FY2022 1st Quarter (Summer 2021) FY2021 3rd & 4th Quarter (Winter & Spring 2020) FY2021 2nd Quarter (Fall 2020) FY2021 1st Quarter (Summer 2020) Target actions for FY2021 Action: Divert Compostable Waste from Recycling and Landfilling Responsible party: UW Recycling FY 2021 steps: Infrastructure: increase compost capacity and update public area bins in 37 buildings, including UW Tower. Outreach: increase in-person and online outreach about proper waste disposal. Implement online waste diversion training, for example create a course in the Bridge Enterprise Training System required for all UW Facilities Staff, and optional for all UW staff. If possible, expand the online Bridge waste diversion training to students if possible and/or affordable. Otherwise, find alternatives to provide waste education online for students. See the full details Action: Implement Low-Waste Campus Kitchens Responsible party: Housing & Food Services FY 2021 steps: HFS Dining will invest in and implement CBORD FSS menu management system in dining locations to aid in more comprehensive forecasting. These efforts will allow UW Dining to more accurately estimate the number of dining patrons and reduce over-purchasing that adds to waste. HFS Dining will utilize over-production tracking within the dining units. The overproduction process and data will be used for two purposes; data will be entered into the menu management software to be used to improve future forecasting. Food that is identified as over-production will be diverted to a local food bank or donation group to be further utilized. HFS Dining will review over-production and over-purchasing data as well as weekly inventory data and reports routinely to identify and take Action against potential points of waste reduction, ultimately reducing the waste stream produced by HFS Dining kitchens.
