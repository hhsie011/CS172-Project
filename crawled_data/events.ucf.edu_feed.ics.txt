Juried by an external panel of three professionals from various areas of the art world, this year's edition of the exhibition features six artists with diverse practices. The selection includes a variety of media, themes, scales, and approaches, showing a wide breadth of perspectives and experiences. Works by the six finalists will be shown at both venues, creating opportunities for engagement with two of the area's major academic constituencies and their surrounding communities. The winning artist of Pathways: The Carlos Malamud Prize will receive a $10,000 cash prize, a solo exhibition at the RMA in the summer of 2023, and will participate as a juror for the following edition of the exhibition. The winner will also receive additional professional development and support. This consistent engagement over time makes Pathways unique and transformative among other art competitions.
