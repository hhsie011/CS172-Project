Zeleke earned his MFA in Writing and Directing at New York University, where his thesis short film, Lottery Boy, earned him an award from the Hollywood Foreign Press Agency in 2012. Zeleke's first feature, Lamb, was screened in the Un Certain Regard section of the Cannes Film Festival in 2015. It was the first Ethiopian film to be included in the "Official Selection". The North American premiere was at the Toronto International Film Festival. Lamb garnered much press with positive reviews from major media outlets including the BBC, CNN, PBS, Le Monde, Der Spiegel, the Guardian, the Financial Times, and the New York Times. In the November issue of Variety magazine that year, Zeleke was featured among the "10 Screenwriters to Watch". Lamb made the shortlist for the 2016 Oscar's Best Foreign Language Film Award. It has since been nominated as well as won "Best Film" prizes in many worldwide festivals. Lamb has sold to over thirty territories, including the U.S. and China. Zeleke is currently working on his second feature script, Sunbirds, which was awarded a Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship. The screenplay has also received a grant from the San Francisco Film Society for 2016/17. Presently, the Sundance Institute is mentoring Zeleke on Sunbirds through its FilmTwo Initiative.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Film & Media Studies Undergraduate Overview Major, Minor, And Modified Major The Major Major Requirements Culminating Experience Culminating Exp.
