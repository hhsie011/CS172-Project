This page last updated: May 24, 2022 6:03 pm EDT Overview Wednesday, May 25, Class Day: Class Photos and ceremony rehearsal for graduates GSD Awards Ceremony and Class Day Address Reception for graduates and guests Thursday, May 26, Commencement Day: Harvard Yard university-wide ceremony GSD Diploma Ceremony Lunch for graduates and guests All graduates and guests should expect continued COVID-19 protection and prevention practices while on-campus. COVID-19 COVID-19 Attestation and Protocols COVID-19 transmission is rated as “high” in Boston and Cambridge. Please use this knowledge as you plan your commencement activities. By registering to participate in Commencement, all graduates and their guests agree to: Abide by all state, local, and University COVID-19 guidelines and protocols in place at the time you come to campus. Acknowledge the evolving nature of current protocols and agree to read all communications from the University sent in advance of this event to ensure you are up to date on the current policies and protocols. Understand that the University strongly encourages all guests to be fully vaccinated and boosted (if eligible) and if unvaccinated to complete a COVID-19 (PCR or antigen) test before arriving on campus. Get tested every day that you have a scheduled event, even if you are not experiencing symptoms. Rapid antigen tests are widely available at area pharmacies. Harvard’s Color PCR testing is still available. We encourage those enrolled in this program to continue using it, in addition to rapid tests. If you test positive, do not attend commencement events during your isolation period. After testing positive, adhere to the 5-day home isolation guidance. For the full 10 days, follow strict masking and do not drink or dine in proximity to other people. Visit the Keep Harvard Healthy website for more information. If you have symptoms, no matter how mild, please do not attend commencement events – even if you test negative. For indoor and crowded outdoor events, wear a high-quality mask that fits securely without air gaps around your nose and mouth. See mask guidance here. If attending events that involve unmasking to eat or drink, minimize any unmasked mingling and mask up whenever you can. All graduates and guests will be required to wear masks when inside GSD campus buildings. Masks may be briefly removed to eat, drink, or pose for photography. The University will continue to actively monitor public health conditions and communicate expectations and guidelines to graduates and guests participating in Commencement. Information for Guests Guest tickets Live webcasts Accessibility Lodging options Guest tickets As usual, GSD graduates will each receive up to two guest tickets to the Harvard yard morning ceremony, and up to three guest tickets to the GSD diploma ceremony. We will also maintain a wait list for both of these Commencement Day ceremonies. Additional options will include live webcasts in Gund Hall during both events, and standing-room-only access to the GSD diploma ceremony. Lunch for graduates and guests following the GSD diploma ceremony will require pre-registration. At present, we do not anticipate requiring advance registration or tickets for events on Class Day. Live webcasts Key events, including the GSD’s Diploma Ceremony, the GSD’s Awards Ceremony and Class Day Address, and the Harvard Yard university-wide ceremony, will also be available by live public webcast for anyone unable to attend in person. The GSD’s webcasts will include live English captions and simultaneous automated translated captions will be available on separate links in Chinese – Traditional, Chinese – Simplified, Greek, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Persian, and Spanish. These can be viewed on cell phones by those attending in person, as well as being available for remote viewers of the livestreams. Livestream event page for Class Day Livestream event page for GSD Diploma Ceremony Class of 2022 Each event page has links to the caption streams for English and the translated captions. The captioning links are the same throughout all events. Accessibility The GSD’s Class Day and Commencement ceremonies will be held in the Gund back yard (Gund Garden). The ceremonies will take place outdoors, primarily on grassy terrain, under the cover of a tent. Guest seating is general admission, aside from seats reserved for those with accessibility needs. Ceremony speakers will use microphones and speak from a podium. Live captioning will be available to view on personal devices. See above section for details. Restrooms are available inside Gund Hall prior to tent entry, and within the ticketed tent area in the form of portable bathrooms, including a wheelchair accessible unit. Graduates will have the opportunity to request accommodations for guests with disabilities or other needs requiring accommodation to participate fully in the celebrations. The GSD’s Commencement team also coordinates any accommodations needed for our graduates or their guests at the Harvard Yard ceremony on the morning of May 26. Some of the accommodations that are available on request can include: Accessible seating for candidates or guests Accommodations for d/Deaf or hard of hearing individuals American Sign Language interpreters Assisted Listening Devices (ALDs) Accessible parking Accommodations for people with visual impairments Lodging options Hotels and bed-and-breakfasts in the Cambridge area will become fully booked well in advance of Commencement. Because there are many other colleges and universities in the Greater Boston area with their own graduation festivities at the same time of year, it can become challenging to locate accommodations as the date gets closer. We recommend making reservations for guest lodging as soon as possible. We advise making reservations that can be cancelled later on, when booking early. Check not only hotels right in Harvard Square (which may already be booked or have high prices due to the high demand) but also surrounding locations. Guests may want to consider hotels that are located on the MBTA public transit system, which opens up areas of Boston and other nearby communities, such as Somerville, Medford, Arlington, and Watertown. Harvard is easily accessible on the MBTA red line subway and by several major bus routes. Public transportation options also include various taxicab and ride-share services. The university Commencement office has created a list of some nearby hotels, which may be helpful in your planning.

The GSD can provide an official letter to the US consulate in your guest’s home country, officially supporting the visa application. Please note that a visa support letter from the GSD is not an official letter of invitation, and it does not guarantee a guest a ticket to attend any specific ceremonies or events. The GSD cannot provide formal graduation announcement letters or invitations. Regalia Harvard requires all graduates to wear official regalia (cap and gown) in order to participate in Commencement ceremonies. The firm deadline to order regalia is April 9, 2022. Graduates are strongly urged to order regalia before April 9 unless they are completely certain they will not attend Commencement, and to do so as early as possible. If you are no longer graduating or attending Commencement this year, regalia order cancellations will receive a full refund up until the day before Commencement (May 25). Graduates can check their GSD email accounts for more information about ordering regalia. Student Orations Competition One of the oldest traditions of the Morning Exercises of Commencement is the Orations Competition in which three students chosen by a panel of judges deliver an address from memory. Each year, one of these three students is a representative of one of Harvard’s graduate and professional schools. Graduating students interested in applying to delivery the graduate student address will find information on the university Commencement website. This year’s workshop for prospective orators was held on Wednesday, March 2 at 3:30 PM. The deadline to submit proposals for oration is Sunday, March 27 at 11:59 PM. Affinity Graduation Ceremonies Affinity graduation ceremonies are student-led, staff supported events that aim to recognize and celebrate the accomplishments of graduates from historically marginalized and underrepresented communities. These events provide an opportunity for graduates to honor those who have helped them achieve their milestone while centering their cultural traditions and values. In 2022, Harvard will host six affinity graduation ceremonies: AAPI/APIDA Graduation Black Graduation Latinx Graduation Lavender Graduation Next Gen (FGLI+) Graduation, and Harvard University Native American Program (HUNAP) Indigenous Graduation. For more information, please see the university page on Affinity Graduation Ceremonies. Questions?
