In order to declare a graduate minor in American Studies, students should discuss how an interdisciplinary minor in American Studies may fit into their overall interests with an Amerian Studies faculty member. They must also make sure that declaring a minor in American Studies is compatible with the requirements of their major field, and secure the approval of their special committee chair. They will have to constitute their special committee so that one special committee member represents American studies. This is a minor field. Application for admission is made only to the major fields. After matriculation, a student may select minor subjects from the major or minor fields.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
