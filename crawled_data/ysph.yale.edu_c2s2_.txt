Highlights Multicenter Reproductive Medicine Network (RMN), established in 1989 and funded by NICHD, conducts clinical trials in reproductive medicine to improve the care of women and men with disorders affecting the reproductive system. Since December 2013, six clinical sites and a Data Coordinating Center (Yale C2S2) have been funded to participate in the RMN. Other affiliated sites are expected to participate depending on the needs of study protocols. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine awarded the RMN the 2013 "Scientific Program Prize Paper" in its Annual meeting in October 2013. Heping Zhang was appointed as the Susan Dwight Bliss Professor of Biostatistics in the Yale School of Public Health. National Genomic and Proteomic Network for Preterm Birth Research (GPN-PBR) has completed its data collection. The goal of GPN is to investigate genetic and environmental factors for preterm birth using genomic, proteomic and metabolomic approaches. The network is funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). Investigators at Yale C2S2 and four other universities participate in this network.
