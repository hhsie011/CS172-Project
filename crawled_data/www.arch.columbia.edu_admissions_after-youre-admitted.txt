Please also see the Admitted Student FAQ or contact the Admissions Office with any remaining questions. M.ARCH, M.S.CCCP, M.S.HP, M.S.UP M.S.AAD, M.S.AUD, M.S.CDP, M.S.RED This timeline is for students enrolling in the Master of Architecture; M.S. Critical, Curatorial, and Conceptual Practices; M.S. Historic Preservation; and M.S. Urban Planning programs beginning with the Fall 2022 Semester. Please note that the first day of classes is September 6, 2022. See the Academic Calendar for additional dates. MARCH Virtual Open House Step 1 Admitted Student Open House: In light of COVID-19 and the University’s current Spring 2022 Visitor Guidelines, GSAPP is hosting the Open House, Info Sessions, and other programming for admitted students virtually. Open House events will be held during the week of March 28. Please register in advance using the link provided in your offer of admission. Step 2 If you require a hard copy of your admission letter, please contact arch_admissions@columbia.edu with specific instructions regarding your request. APRIL Submit Enrollment Decision, apply for Visa, activate UNI, and apply for housing Step 3 April 15 is the deadline for submitting your enrollment decision on the Application Portal and paying the $700 non-refundable deposit fee. The deposit fee requires a credit card payment (Visa and Mastercard). If you’ve been admitted and plan to enroll in an approved GSAPP dual degree program, you will need to confirm enrollment in each program but you only need to submit one deposit. Please contact GSAPP Admissions at arch_admissions@columbia.edu for further instructions. Step 4 International Students: Apply for a visa immediately after submitting your enrollment decision. Contact the International Students & Scholars Office (newintlstudent@columbia.edu, 212-854-3587) to coordinate your visa application as soon as possible. You will need your Columbia University Identification Number/Personal Identification Number (CUID)/(PID). This number will arrive by email after you’re admitted. The visa application is located on the ISSO website. ISSO can provide a confirmation that your application has been received. Step 5 April 15: Activate your UNI, an ID number that will allow you to access all of Columbia University’s electronic resources. For more information including instructions, visit Columbia University Information Technology (CUIT). The activation process requires you to submit your name, birth date, and social security number (if applicable). After you activate your UNI, please login to your Columbia University email account at LionMail. All communication from the Office of Student Affairs will be sent to the email that you listed on your application until the first day of classes. After that point, all communication will be sent to your Columbia email address. Step 6 April 20 is the deadline to apply for Columbia Residential Housing to be included in the first round of the housing lottery. Create and submit an application on the Housing Portal. You will need your Columbia University Identification Number/Personal Identification Number (CUID)/(PID) and your Activated UNI GSAPP conducts a lottery in order to fairly distribute University Housing allocations among applicants (priority is given to students traveling long distances). If you do not receive an allocation in the lottery, you are advised to seek an alternative (see suggestions below). You will automatically be moved to the waitlist unless you decide to withdraw your application. Not all students on the waitlist will be housed. For more information, visit Columbia Residential, which includes a Student Housing Essentials page. You can also view your Housing Wait List status online. For housing alternatives, visit Columbia Off-Campus Housing Assistance (OCHA), and International House. MAY Submit Official Transcripts, Fulfill Immunization Requirements, Certify Health Insurance decision Step 7 Credentials Verification: All enrolling students must provide official final transcripts from each post-secondary institution attended, even if a degree was not awarded. For a transcript to be considered official, it must be sent from the Registrar’s Office directly to the GSAPP Office of Admissions via secure electronic delivery or as a completed WES evaluation (if applicable). Incoming students awaiting diplomas from former institutions should deliver a certification letter to GSAPP confirming that all coursework is completed within the first two weeks of school. Please see the Credentials Verification webpage for detailed instructions on how to submit official transcripts. Step 8 Fulfill the immunization requirements as soon as possible to avoid delays in registration. Certify your meningitis vaccination decision and provide documentation of immunity to Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) after you have activated your UNI. A registration hold will be placed on your account until your immunization requirements have been fulfilled. You will need your CUID/PID and UNI to submit these documents: Meningitis Vaccination: Submit your meningitis vaccination decision online. MMR Immunity: For the MMR form located here, you will need to fill out the student section and your doctor/physician will need to fill out the remaining portion. Submit MMR Documentation to Immunization Compliance through the online portal. Covid-19 Vaccine: University policy requires that students must provide documentation of being fully vaccinated. Completion of the vaccine process is defined as completion of the initial vaccination and booster dose (if eligible). Submit Covid-19 vaccine documentation to Immunization Compliance through the online portal. GSAPP cannot confirm the receipt of your immunization documents. If your immunization documentation has been successfully processed, your immunization hold will be lifted. You can check this in the Holds section in SSOL. Students can check their compliance at any time by visiting the Medical Clearances section of the patient portal. For more information on immunization compliance requirements, please visit Columbia Health or contact immunizationcompliance@columbia.edu.
