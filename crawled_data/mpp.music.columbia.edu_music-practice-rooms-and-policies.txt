SHAPIRO PRACTICE ROOMS REMAIN OPEN. If you are a current Columbia University student, faculty, staff or affiliate, there are various practice rooms on campus that you may utilize. These rooms are first-come, first-serve: (8) in Schapiro Hall (24-hour access; requires CU ID card only- PROGRAMMED IN 621 DODGE HALL WEEKDAYS, 10AM–12PM AND 2PM–4PM) (3) in the Broadway dorm (closed during quiet hours; requires CU ID card w/dorm sticker)-PLEASE NOTE- due to Covid restrictions, only residents of this dorm can use these rooms. (3) in the East Campus dorm (closed during quiet hours; requires CU ID card w/dorm sticker)-PLEASE NOTE- due to Covid restrictions, only residents of this dorm can use these rooms.

To obtain swipe access, please go to go to the Music Office/621 Dodge (Weekdays, 10am–12pm and 2pm–4pm). For Broadway & East Campus dorm rooms, a key is required that will open any of those (6) rooms (go to Music Office/621 Dodge, to obtain key). The key for the rooms in Broadway and East Campus requires a $30 cash only deposit, no exceptions. The deposit will be refunded via University reimbursement policies & procedures, which takes approximately 3 weeks after returning the key to 621 Dodge. Because it takes 3 weeks to return the deposit money, we recommend students retain the key for the entirety of their academic career at Columbia University, assuming they are residing on campus in the dorms and have a need to utilize the practice rooms. Grand Pianos are also available for public use and are located in Lerner Hall, John Jay Lounge, and the GSAS Student Lounge in 301 Philosophy Hall. Grand pianos in East Campus, Wallach and Wein Halls are accessible to CU students with dorm stickers. Teacher’s College has music practice rooms available to rent by the semester for Columbia University students, faculty & staff who have an active ID. For a fee, users may reserve up to seven hours per week. Each room is equipped with a Steinway 1098 upright piano, armless chairs and a music stand. To rent a practice room, please visit the Music Education office in 520A Horace Mann.
