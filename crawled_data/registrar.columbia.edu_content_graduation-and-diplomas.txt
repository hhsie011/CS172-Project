Every candidate, regardless of graduation date, is invited to participate in the May Commencement ceremony. For complete Commencement information, please visit the official Columbia University Commencement website. Graduation Requirements You should consult with your academic advisor within your school or department to be sure all of your graduation requirements have been met. Students in Columbia College, undergraduate SEAS, the Premedical Post Baccalaureate program, MIA, and MPA, as well as some programs in the Schools of Business, Social Work and Public Health, can use the Degree Audit Report (DAR). The DAR is used by both students and staff of these schools to aid in advisement and analyze students' progress toward degree. The DAR is only an aid to advisement, not an official document. Note: Deans and advisors are the final authorities on whether graduation requirements have been met. Degree/Certificate Application In order to be considered for a degree or certificate, you must file an application with your school or department. Exceptions: Doctoral & M. Phil. degrees: Go to your department or follow instructions from the Dissertation Office. Application Deadlines You should submit the Application for Degree or Certificate by the appropriate deadline.
