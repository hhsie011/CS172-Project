Guides Find Your Librarian Attend Workshops Writing Support ☰ Libraries Teaching Support Library Materials for Courses Library Materials for Courses We have several options for incorporating library materials in your teaching. Books & DVDs Course Reserves have short loan periods to ensure access to books and DVDs required for your course. Borrow a film to show in class. Request the film in Library Search, and we’ll hold it at the library’s desk for you to pick up. Streaming Movies Streaming films are available in Digital Campus, Films on Demand, and Kanopy. See our Library Search guide for help finding streaming films. If we don't have access, you can request a streaming film. Licenses for streaming films can have expiration dates, so check to ensure that we have current access to films each semester you assign them. Online Articles & Ebooks We cannot provide access to articles or ebooks not owned or subscribed to by SMU. Ebooks may have limits on the number of users. If you plan to require an ebook in your course, email smuert@smu.edu to make sure we have access first. Link to Library Resources To use library-owned books and articles in your courses, use permalinks in Canvas rather than upload files to help us track what's being used, improve copyright compliance, and ensure students can access materials off-campus. Get permalink instructions. Print Articles We are unable to digitize SMU Libraries print materials for courses. Instead, place the print journal on reserve for your class. You may also scan the article in the library. We recommend scanning no more than 15% of a journal issue for Canvas uploads. Request a Purchase To request that we purchase a book, DVD, or streaming film for use in a course, fill out a Purchase Request. If we don’t own an article, you can request a course pack from the SMU bookstore. Special Collections Materials SMU Libraries’ Special Collections has a wealth of primary source material on a variety of topics that can be incorporated into your course. We will work with you to integrate relevant materials into class sessions. Learn more about Classroom Instruction.
