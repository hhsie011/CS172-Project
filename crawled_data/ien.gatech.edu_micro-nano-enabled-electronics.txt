Learn More Research Facilities IEN is comprised of several unique, educational, fabrication and characterization laboratories for Nano, Micro, and Bio-device research enabling leading-edge human resource and technology development, from the basic discovery stage to prototype realization. Learn More IEN Centers & Programs IEN provides direct supports to 9 centers and programs. Additionally, More than 190 faculty members are associated with IEN, many having laboratories in the Pettit Microelectronics, Marcus Nanotechnology, Van Leer, TSRB, Callaway, and Love Buildings on campus. Learn More Reminder for Researchers Since IEN and MCF (as part of the Southeastern Nanotechnology Infrastructure Corridor, SENIC) are supported by the National Science Foundation through the National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure (NNCI), we request that this support is acknowledged in publications and presentations that are made possible by work performed at IEN/MCF. For papers, a suggested acknowledgement may read (feel free to cut/paste): This work was performed in part at the Georgia Tech Institute for Electronics and Nanotechnology, a member of the National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure, which is supported by the National Science Foundation (Grant ECCS-1542174). In presentations, listing IEN, SENIC, and/or NNCI along with your other acknowledgements is sufficient. (If you wish to use the IEN, SENIC, or NNCI logo, please ask and we will send it to you.) Each year you will also be asked to submit a comprehensive list of all patents, presentations, and publications which relate to work done at IEN/MCF in the past year. If your work is featured on a journal cover, please let us know. Questions about IEN related publications should be directed to Amy Duke (amy.duke@ien.gatech.edu) or David Gottfried (dsgottfried@gatech.edu).
