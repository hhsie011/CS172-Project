Educational Objectives: The robotics minor covers the fundamentals of designing, building and programming robots, and in addition requires students to dive deeper in a specific area of robotics. Requirements 1) Six distinct courses including at least three from Group A and three from a single category within Group B, must be completed. 2) ME majors may not count MAE 3780 if it is used to satisfy the ME circuits requirement Academic Standards: A grade of C or better in each course.
