High school groups are offered a 60-minute guided campus tour led by a student tour guide, and we offer an engaging scavenger hunt for all our elementary and middle school aged visitors. Visits are coordinated on a first come, first served basis. It’s recommended that groups submit their visit requests at least 4 weeks in advance for the best chance at reserving their preferred visit date and time. During high-volume visit time periods, we encourage you to submit your visit request at least three months in advance.
