Charles A. Platt's Italian Garden Photographs Home Published Images Unpublished Images In 1892, Charles A. Platt traveled to Italy with his brother, William, to view Italian Renaissance villas and gardens. Many of the photographs he took were used to illustrate his Italian Gardens (Harper & Brothers, 1894). Additional images were included in the 1993 reissue of Italian Gardens, with an overview by Keith Morgan (Sagapress/Timber Press). The remainder of these images remained unpublished. The images displayed in this exhibition have been photographed from the original 8" x 10" glass plate negatives held in the Charles A. Platt Architectural Records and Papers Collection, Drawings & Archives Collection, Avery Architectural & Fine Arts Library.
