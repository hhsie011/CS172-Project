Miami Circle is a volunteer organization made up of undergraduate UM alumni and parents of current or past students. This program allows parents and alumni to share their stories and experiences with prospective students and their families by volunteering at events such as college fairs and information sessions in your area. Volunteers represent the University by broadening our reach at college fairs, serving on panels, and other UM student recruitment events. At the University of Miami, we know our biggest fans are our former students, and if you’re interested in helping us recruit the best and the brightest, we’d love to have you join us. Become a Member How You Can Help As a volunteer, you are asked to give your time each year to assist with recruitment events in your area. What our volunteers do: Represent the University of Miami at college fairs, either in assistance to admission staff or on your own. Assist admission staff at local admitted student receptions. Assist admission staff at on-campus programs (local Miami Circle members only). Assist the University in identifying and recruiting a diverse student body. Meet with admitted students to welcome them to the 'Cane family. Other activities depending on interest level.
