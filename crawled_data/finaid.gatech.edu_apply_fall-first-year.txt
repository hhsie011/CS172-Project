We encourage all incoming students to apply for financial aid. You should file as early as you can to maximize your potential aid opportunities. By applying for financial aid, you're automatically considered for all need-based aid. You will need to reapply for financial aid every year. Application Steps Prospective first-year students admitted to start in Fall 2022 should apply for financial aid by completing the following aid applications: Step 1: Georgia Tech Application for Scholarships and Financial Aid (GT App) If you wish to receive funds from any federal, state, or institutional sources for the fall semester, you must complete the 2022-23 Georgia Tech Application for Scholarships and Financial Aid (GT APP). Please Note: Students who have been awarded funds from outside/private scholarships must also complete a GT App so that the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid (OSFA) may determine the proper disbursement schedule for your funds. Items Needed You will need a GT Account username and password to login to OSCAR to access the form. To activate your GT account, visit passport.gatech.edu. Submit the GT App Step 2: Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) In addition to the GT App, if you wish to be considered for Federal Aid or need-based institutional funds, you must also complete the 2022-23 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) using your 2020 tax information. OSFA uses the FASFA to determine whether you qualify for federal, state, or institutional funds that carry a financial need component. Please note: Georgia residents who wish to apply for the HOPE/Zell Miller Scholarship ONLY may complete the Georgia Student Financial Aid Application (GSFAPPS) form instead of the FAFSA. The GT App is also required. Items Needed Georgia Tech's Title IV school code: 001569. Your social security number and, if you are a dependent student, your parents’ social security numbers. Your driver’s license number if you have one, or Alien Registration number if you are not a U.S. citizen. Federal tax information or tax returns from two years prior including IRS W-2 information, for you (and your spouse, if you are married), and for your parents if you are a dependent student. If you are selected for verification, you will need to provide the specific documentation requested based on academic year and your dependency status. Financial aid awards are not final and will not be disbursed until the verification process is complete. FAFSA processing can take up to 3 – 5 business days after completion. Submit the FAFSA Step 3: College Board CSS Profile College Board’s CSS Profile is an online application for non-federal student financial aid. This application is only required for incoming first-year students who want to be considered for need-based assistance from Georgia Tech institutional funds. The CSS Profile is NOT required for students applying for Federal funds only, HOPE/Zell Miller Scholarship only, or those who do not want to be considered for institutional funds. Please note: The CSS Profile application cannot be accepted after the priority deadline on January 31. Items Needed College Board username and password or sign up for a new account. Georgia Tech's CSS code: 5248. Most recently completed tax returns. W-2 forms and other records of current year income, as well as records of untaxed income and benefits if applicable. Assets and bank statements. Review the 2022-23 CSS Profile Student Guide for additional information and tips. Submit the CSS Profile Step 4: Georgia Student Financial Aid Application (GSFAPPS) – Georgia Residents Only The Georgia Student Financial Aid Application (GSFAPPS) is the state aid application for Georgia residents who want to be considered for the HOPE or Zell Miller Scholarship ONLY. You do NOT need to complete the GSFAPPS if you are applying for federal financial aid and submitting the FAFSA. To be considered for the HOPE or Zell Miller Scholarship, you must also complete the GT App. Submit the GSFAPPS Important Dates and Deadlines All financial aid applications become available on October 1. The priority filing date to be considered for need-based aid awarded through Georgia Tech’s OSFA is January 31. To be considered an “on-time” financial aid applicant, all applicable aid applications listed above, as well as any requested documentation, must be received and complete by January 31. OSFA will continue to accept late applications and documentation after the priority date, however, we strongly encourage all applicants to submit their completed applications and documentation as soon as possible so we can determine your eligibility for other types of aid. Next Steps Learn about the financial aid award process, including information on how aid is determined, instructions for accepting your awards, and more! The Award Process Admitted to the Summer Term? Since the Summer 2022 semester is part of the 2021-22 academic year, the applications above do not cover the upcoming summer term. If you wish to apply for financial aid for the Summer 2022 semester, you must complete the summer first-year aid applications separately, along with any other supplemental documentation requested.
