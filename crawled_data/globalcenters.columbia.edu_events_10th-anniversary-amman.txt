8:00 PM Columbia University, Katharina Screening Room, Lenfest Center for the Arts Challenging the rules that have governed the Arab region for decades, Arab queer filmmakers are adopting creative, non-conventional approaches to share their stories, building pathways between otherwise isolated minorities. In the wake of the Arab Spring, they have stepped forward to take part in a transnational dialogue on democracy, liberty and reform, hoping to shape the way towards equality and recognition of LGBTQ rights in the region. This panel will engage five emerging LGBTQ filmmakers from the Arab world in a meaningful discussion on the role of Arab queer cinema in shaping and giving voice to the Arab LGBTQ community. Panelists will explore how emerging Arab queer cinema is engaging with the region’s turbulent socio-political arena, while drawing on their personal journeys, creative expressions, and motivations. Recognizing the agency of Arab queer filmmakers through cinema, this event will explore how LGBTQ issues are being represented in popular Arabic culture, and how their work is being received by local and regional audiences. Panelists Anthony Chidiac Anthony is an independent film artist based in Beirut. His works include Equal men and Maman, non, merci. His latest work, Room for a man, premiered at the Montreal International Documentary Festival where it was awarded the grand prize for international competition, as well as being awarded best film in Queer Lisboa and Queer Hamburg in 2018.
