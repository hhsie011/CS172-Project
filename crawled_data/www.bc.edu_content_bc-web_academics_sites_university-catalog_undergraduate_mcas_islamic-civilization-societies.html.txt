Electives must be distributed among at least two other departments in addition to the disciplinary base. Senior Seminar and Research Project/Honors Thesis: Two Courses All majors will be required to enroll in a thesis seminar in the fall of their senior year. In the spring term of their senior year, students will complete a senior thesis under the supervision of a faculty member affiliated with the Program. The Senior Seminar will allow ICS majors to integrate the knowledge, skills, and concepts of their diverse disciplinary bases and to share them in a genuinely cross-disciplinary manner. The course encourages students to make intellectual connections across disciplines and to engage in critical reflection. After exploring common themes, majors will develop a research design, select a methodology, engage in research, and begin writing the thesis. Language Requirement: Four Courses Students will be expected to attain proficiency (completion of intermediate level) in a relevant language such as Arabic, Hebrew, Turkish, Persian, or Urdu. In some cases, French, Russian, Chinese or other languages relevant to specific research concerns may be accepted for students specializing in the study of Muslims in Africa, Central Asia, China, Europe, or the Americas, subject to approval by the program's director. Boston College currently offers four years of Arabic language instruction, from Elementary Intensive through Advanced Arabic. Students studying abroad can enroll in even more intensive language programs offered in Morocco, Kuwait, Egypt, Jordan, Sharjah, UAE, and at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London (SOAS) during the regular academic year and in the summer. Our students have also studied during the summer months at Middlebury, Harvard, and Columbia to accelerate their language skills, and several have won U.S. State Department Critical Language Scholarships and Flagship Fellowships to study Arabic in the summer. Arabic and other relevant languages can be taken through the Boston Area Consortium. Our Consortium partners, B.U., Brandeis, and Tufts in particular, offer additional languages such as Persian, Turkish, and advanced levels of Hebrew if majors wish to study a language other than, or in addition to, Arabic. Minor Requirements Minor Requirements Students seeking to earn an Islamic Civilization and Societies minor must submit a proposed plan of study to the Director, listing the courses that will be taken to fulfill the requirements. In general, proposed plans of study for the minor should be submitted no later than the second semester of the sophomore year. The Director will review the proposed plan of study and, if accepted by the Undergraduate Committee, will grant approval for the student. Students will be expected to consult with the Director at each semester registration period to update their plan of study.
