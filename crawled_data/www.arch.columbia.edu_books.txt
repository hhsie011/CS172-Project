The essays in Issue 56 test the limits of the review as a genre: looking at and through places, methods, and books to envision and approach other ideas differently. Jay Cephas reads through Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor’s Race for Profit to deepen conceptions of racial capitalism; Marianela D’Aprile and Douglas Spencer reframe Manfredo Tafuri to envigorate unionization among architectural workers; Stefanie Hessler reviews the art and literature of an erotic ocean, riding in, on, and through its waves; Daniel Jacobs and Brittany Utting evaluate the possibilities and pitfalls of three legal instruments of forest sovereignty; and Dima Srouji excavates histories, and present-day realities, of settler colonial archaeology in Palestine.
