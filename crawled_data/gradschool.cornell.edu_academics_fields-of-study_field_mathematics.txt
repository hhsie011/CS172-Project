One feature that makes the program at Cornell particularly attractive is the broad range of interests of the faculty. In addition to the usual areas of algebra, analysis and geometry, the department has outstanding groups in the areas of algebraic geometry, combinatorics, dynamical systems, logic, Lie groups, and partial differential equations, including their numerical treatment. The field also maintains close ties with distinguished graduate programs in the fields of applied mathematics, computer science, operations research, and statistics. The field of mathematics requires that you pass a test of basic mathematical reading ability in one language other than English. The allowed languages are French, German, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, and Portuguese, regardless of whether any of these is your native tongue. However, to ensure maximal relevance to your research area, your choice of language must be approved by your thesis advisor (special committee chair); if he/she has no opinion you may make your own choice. Candidates must have some teaching experience prior to graduation, a one-semester appointment as a teaching assistant is the department minimum requirement. Students seeking a minor in mathematics should contact the Director of Graduate Studies. A course work master's degree in computer science is available to students in the Ph.D. program in mathematics. Details are available from the graduate field office. Application: Applicants must have completed the work for an undergraduate degree in mathematics. That work should have included a rigorous course in advanced calculus and real variable theory that will serve as an introduction to measure theory. The student should also have some familiarity with applications of advanced calculus and should have had courses in linear algebra and modern abstract algebra at an advanced level. Non-native English speaking applicants must also submit minimum TOEFL scores of Writing: 20, Listening: 15, Reading: 20, and Speaking: 22 (Internet-based test).

Algorithmic game theory, an emerging new area of designing systems and algorithms for selfish users. My research focuses algorithms and games on graphs or networks. I am mostly interested in designing algorithms and games that provide provably close-to-optimal results.

I like to study the family of compatible Galois representations associated to various arithmetic objects (eg. abelian varieties, modular forms, Drinfeld modules); these representations encode much, if not all, of the arithmetic of the originally object. Galois representations can also be used to study the absolute the Galois group of the rational numbers, and I have recently been playing with some applications to the Inverse Galois Problem.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
