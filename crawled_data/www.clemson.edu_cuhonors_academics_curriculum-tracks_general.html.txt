To this end, students are encouraged to take Honors courses in as many different areas of study as possible. For a full list of Honors course offerings, please check the iROAR registration system. Students are advised to contact their Honors advisor if they are unclear with which group a course will satisfy. Basic Policies Most of the courses students will take for General Honors are 1000-2000 level courses that satisfy the university’s General Education requirements or serve as introductory courses in a student’s major. It is permissible for 3000-4000 level courses to be taken for General Honors; however, 1000- and 2000-level honors courses may not be applied toward the requirements of Departmental Honors.

Honors courses can be counted towards either General Honors or Departmental Honors but not for both General and Departmental Honors.
