Emmons, Program Head Tyler School of Art Building, Room 260C 215-777-9126 amze.emmons@temple.edu The Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) in Printmaking program at the Tyler School of Art and Architecture—one of the nation's top programs—offers students access to exceptional faculty, world-class facilities, and strong regional and national professional networks. Tyler Printmaking majors join a welcoming community of artists and educators. Bridging tradition and innovation, students learn the full range of printmaking techniques from the simplest to the most technically advanced. Students learn how to think critically and solve problems, working with professors, and side-by-side with graduate students. Tyler provides access to the resources of a large, public research university combined with the intimacy of an art school. Tyler BFA students take full advantage of the school's location in Philadelphia, a vibrant art center with a strong printmaking tradition, to find internships and jobs, explore museums and galleries, launch creative practices, start businesses and earn placements in the most competitive graduate programs. Designed to complement the studio experience with tools to support a studio practice or pursue graduate studies, the Entrepreneurship coursework enhances students' career options. Graduates of this degree program will possess requisite business skills to support themselves as visual artists or entrepreneurs in art and related fields.

Please Note: An approved study abroad program waives the GenEd Global/World Society (GG) requirement; however, these credits must be made up with academic coursework taken outside of Tyler departments to be in compliance with BFA accreditation. BFA majors interested in studying abroad should consult with an academic advisor to determine if a semester (generally spring semester of second year) or a summer program would be the best option to remain on track for graduation.
