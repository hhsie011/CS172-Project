UNM is committed to offering services, information, resources and tools to offer a safe campus to all students, staff, faculty, and visitors. We also encourage individuals to contribute to campus safety and preparedness by becoming informed, staying alert and using good judgment.

Emergency planning must protect people as well as the institution’s operations such as research, athletic and entertainment events, food services, housing and transportation.
