Dartmouth takes pride in encouraging students to be “inventive, flexible, and resilient, prepared to take on anything that nature and their work in the world throw at them.” These skills are put to the test each year during winter carnival. This is the time swimmers bravely face the polar bear plunge, skiers fly off the ski jump, and human/dog sledders vie for bragging rights.
