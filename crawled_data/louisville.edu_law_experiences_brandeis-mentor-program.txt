The goal of this program is to match law students with professional mentors who will serve as their role models and advocates throughout the law school experience. Whenever possible, students will be paired with mentors who practice in an area of law for which the student has an interest, or with an attorney who shares experiences and/or interests. This initiative connects students with local attorneys, regional programs and national opportunities that make the journey through law school, more exciting and valuable. The Brandeis School of Law recognizes the powerful positive effects of mentoring for students and young professionals. All first-year students have the opportunity to engage with professional mentors through this program and are assigned an upper-class student advisor as part of the Success Skills Group (SSG) program. If you have any questions about this program, please email the Brandeis Mentor Program.
