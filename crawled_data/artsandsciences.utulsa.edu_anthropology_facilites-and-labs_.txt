Our labs, run by faculty members, include microscopes and other equipment for the analyses of stone tools, ceramics and bones, as well as store a wide range of original anthropological material. In addition, the anthropology department houses several joint facilities and collections, not related to any specific department member. These facilities house state of the art equipment available for research and teaching. The availability of such equipment makes the TU anthropology department unique among other anthropology departments in the region. The Department of Anthropology also benefits from close collaboration with research institutions across TU which provide unique resources to undergraduate students as well as faculty. Laboratories From a Human Ecology lab with a Zeiss Stemi 2000 microscope to a Lithic Microwear and Technology lab, learn how our anthropology labs will expand and support your research. Learn more.
