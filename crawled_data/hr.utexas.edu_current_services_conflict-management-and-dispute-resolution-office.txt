Listen impartially to concerns and help repair relationships. Restorative Justice: Options for restorative processes that respond to harms, impacts and needs through community/team building circles, meaningful accountability dialogues and conferences, and reentry support circles following suspension, extended leave, etc. Navigate bureaucratic systems and policies.
