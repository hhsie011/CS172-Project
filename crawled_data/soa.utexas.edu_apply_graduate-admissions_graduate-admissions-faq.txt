What is the application deadline? What do I need to submit to apply? What if my letter of recommendation, test score, or other documents will not arrive by the deadline? What is the most important component of my application? What should I include in my portfolio? What is the minimum acceptable GRE score? What is the minimum acceptable GPA (grade-point average)? What is the minimum acceptable TOEFL score? Are there any prerequisites? Do you admit for spring or summer semesters? Can I apply as a transfer student? Will you review my résumé/CV/portfolio to advise me if I am a competitive applicant? When can I expect an admission decision? How will I be notified of the decision? How long is the program? How large is the Fall 2020 class? What percent of applicants were admitted for Fall 2020? Which programs are accredited? If I have no background in architecture, am I eligible to apply to the M Arch program? How will I know if I will receive advanced standing in the first-professional program(s)? Can I visit the graduate programs in The School of Architecture? Do you have brochures you can send me? How much is tuition? What is the cost of attendance? What type of funding do you offer? What types of scholarships are available? Do you offer need-based financial aid? Am I eligible for a teaching (TA) or research (GRA) assistantship? How can I establish Texas residency? Where can I find information about services and immigration paperwork for international students? What is the application deadline? Refer to each program's application instructions for the deadlines. What do I need to submit to apply? See our application instructions for the application process and required materials. What if my letter of recommendation, test score, or other documents will not arrive by the deadline? It is an applicant's responsibility to ensure all required materials are submitted by the deadline. Admissions committees will not review late applications and we are unable to make an admission decision on an incomplete file. What is the most important component of my application? For design programs, the portfolio is most important. The statement of purpose and letters of recommendation are also important to our admissions committees. What should I include in my portfolio? Refer to each program's application instructions for detailed portfolio instructions. What is the minimum acceptable GRE score? There is no minimum GRE score requirement. Test scores are considered with all other required application materials. Admission decisions are based on a holistic review of all application materials. The Graduate School publishes average GRE statistics. Most programs have waived the GRE for Fall 2022. Refer to each program's application instructions for details. What is the minimum acceptable GPA (grade-point average)? The Graduate School requires a 3.0 grade point average for admission, calculated on upper-division undergraduate courses (junior- and senior- level courses) and any graduate courses. If your GPA for admission does not meet the 3.0 minimum requirement - or if you feel that your GPA is not a valid indicator of your ability - you may submit your ApplyTexas application, then upload a statement for the admissions committee through the Document Upload System explaining your situation. If other factors negate a low GPA, it is possible to be admitted following a petition to the Graduate School. What is the minimum acceptable TOEFL score? Please see GIAC's minimum acceptable scores information. Are there any prerequisites? Prerequisites are listed in each program's application instructions. Do you admit for spring or summer semesters? The SOA admits only for the fall semesters. Most students admitted to the 3-year M Arch and the MLA I programs will begin in the summer. When can I expect an admission decision? How will I be notified of the decision? We expect admission decisions to be available in late February or early March. When a decision is available, it will appear on MyStatus. Can I apply as a transfer student? Students wishing to transfer from a graduate program at another institution follow the standard admissions process. UT Austin does not have an official transfer option for graduate students. If admitted, you will be considered as beginning a new degree at UT Austin. The Graduate Office will evaluate your transcript(s) and you will receive an estimate of the credit you will receive for previous coursework. Will you review my résumé/CV/portfolio to advise me if I am a competitive applicant or my chances of admission? We are unable to review information sent to our office. We, nor our faculty, are able to review portfolios to provide feedback in advance of the admissions process. If you wish to be considered for admission, you must submit a complete application through our official admissions process. How long is the program? Master of Architecture, First-Professional: 3 years or 2 years with advanced standing Master of Advanced Architectural Design: 1 ½ years Master of Arts in Architectural History: 2 years Master of Interior Design, First-Professional: 3 ½ years Master of Interior Design, Post-Professional: 2 years Master of Landscape Architecture, First-Professional: 3 years Master of Landscape Architecture, Post-Professional: 2 – 2 ½ years Master of Science in Architectural Studies (Interdisciplinary): 2 years Master of Science in Community and Regional Planning: 2 – 3 years Master of Science in Historic Preservation: 2 years Master of Science in Sustainable Design: 2 years Master of Science in Urban Design: 2 years How large is the Fall 2020 class?

See GIAC's Admissions & Enrollment Statistics page. Which programs are accredited? The accredited professional degree programs offered by the School of Architecture are the Bachelor of Architecture (BArch), the first-professional Master of Architecture (M Arch), the first-professional Master of Interior Design (MID I), and the first-professional Master of Landscape Architecture (MLA I). Please note that professional degrees from foreign countries must be individually evaluated by the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB) to pursue licensure in the United States. If I have no background in architecture, am I eligible to apply to the M Arch program? Yes, our M Arch degree program is open to students without any background in Architecture. How will I know if I will receive advanced standing in the first-professional program(s)? After you are admitted, our Graduate Office and Graduate Advisers will evaluate your background and inform you if you will receive advanced standing. Can I visit the graduate programs in the School of Architecture? We’ll offer virtual Info Sessions throughout the fall where we’ll go over application information and prospective students can hear from faculty and current students. Please RSVP on our Visit website. Also, the School of Architecture Lectures & Events page provides information on activities scheduled in and around the School. Do you have any brochures you can send me? Rather than print brochures, our website is updated with current information. How much is tuition? Texas One Stop publishes tuition rate information. What is the cost of attendance? Visit Texas One Stop to calculate tuition and cost of attendance. What type of funding do you offer? Funding opportunities are described on our Student Funding pages. What types of scholarships are available? Scholarship opportunities are described on our Student Funding pages. Do you offer need-based financial aid? U.S. Citizens and permanent residents may apply for federal financial aid through Texas One Stop by completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Am I eligible for a teaching (TA) or graduate research (GRA) assistantship? Yes, although it is our policy that first-semester graduate students do not hold assistantship positions. Teaching and graduate research assistantships are available to all of our continuing students. These positions are appointed at the recommendation of the hiring faculty or staff member. TA positions are filled through an application process each year. Approximately 50% of applicants are recommended to an appointment. Most interested students will directly contact the faculty member or resource for which they would like to apply. How can I establish Texas residency? Please see the Texas Admissions residency information for details about determining, establishing, and reviewing Texas residency. Where can I find information about services and immigration paperwork for international students? Please contact International Student and Scholar Services.
