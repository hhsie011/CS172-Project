Your involvement—and the ongoing support you provide—make an amazing difference in our students' lives. You help them fulfill their goals and dreams. To help Tech Law reach its full potential, we need the support of all alumni and friends. Diminished levels of state support mean your contributions make an immediate and direct impact on the quality of education we provide, the reputation of your law school, and the opportunities available to our students. Your gift also sets an example for others and acknowledges the value of your own legal education. If you have contributed in the past, thank you. You helped the law school progress and serve society through our graduates' efforts. How to Give Donate online at donate.law.ttu.edu using our secure payment system.
