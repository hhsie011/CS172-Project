Being a Baylor nurse means being the hands and feet of Christ for those who are hurting or in need of comfort. Unmistakably, the need for caring and compassionate nurses has never been greater. More than ever before we all appreciate that nurses are called to serve and to care for the physical, social, psychological/emotional and spiritual needs of their patients. This special calling to serve others through academic excellence results in qualities that are unique to a Baylor Nursing graduate and instantly recognized and appreciated by patients, employers, and the community. Our Mission Learn.Lead.Serve. Exemplifying the nursing school motto, Learn.Lead.Serve.® it is the steadfast mission of the LHSON to educate and prepare both Baccalaureate and Graduate-level nurses within a Christian community for professional practice, healthcare leadership, and worldwide service. Baylor University Louise Herrington School of Nursing alumni, donors and friends of Baylor are treasured. We hope you enjoy staying connected with other Baylor LHSON alumni through the Baylor Alumni Nursing Group.
