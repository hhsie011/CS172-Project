Of all thefts reported the majority are due to unattended or improperly secured items. The Campaign OPERATION THEFT AWARENESS is an educational campaign, launched in collaboration with the Undergraduate Assembly (UA), Graduate and Student Professional Assembly (GAPSA), United Minorities Council (UMC) and the Medical Emergency Response Team (MERT), to further promote the idea that “Safety & Security is a Shared Responsibility.” The goal is to educate all members of the Penn community and visitors to our University City retail stores and restaurants about the dangers of leaving personal items unattended or improperly secured. With the overall success of the campaign’s launch in January of 2008, Operation Theft Awareness has now become an on going educational component to the Division’s public safety program. Theft: More Than Just Personal Property Serious consequences are associated with theft of personal items. Besides the loss of personal property, theft is also inconvenient and may result in the loss of things that are of substantial emotional and professional significance. Unattended and improperly secured items put you at greater risk of theft, which can result in: Identify theft Loss of irreplaceable photos Loss of all of your phone contact numbers Loss of important work, such as a thesis or research analysis Before you walk away from your property: Stop, Think & Secure Protecting Personal Items Preventing Bicycle Theft Preventing Fraud & ID Theft College House & On Campus Off Campus Residential CampusExpress Property Registration Quicklinks Emergency Preparedness 24/7 Walking Escort Theft Awareness RAD Self Defense Courses Penn Guardian UPennAlert Explore Departments Emergency Preparedness University of Pennsylvania Police Department (UPPD) Information and Statistics Safety Initiatives Report Accessibility Issues & Get Help Media Clery Contact Privacy Policy Connect with DPS Receive DPS Traffic Advisories Learn About Penn Guardian © 2016 The University of Pennsylvania. 4040 Chestnut Street Philadelphia, PA 19104 215.898.7297 | Contact Us Rotate Your Phone to Portrait Mode Open toolbar Accessibility Tools Increase Text Decrease Text Grayscale High Contrast Negative Contrast Light Background Links Underline Readable Font Reset
