Full Text Research Research Overview My most recent book, "Latinx Literature Unbound: Undoing Ethnic Expectation," (Fordham UP, 2018) puzzles through what we talk about when we talk about Latinx literature. I analyze the possibilities and limitations of using the ethno-racial label Latinx and suggest that there may be more illuminating ways to organize and analyze this body of literature. Research Statement In my critical study of the Chicana/o detective novel, Brown Gumshoes: Detective Fiction and the Search for Chicana/o Identity (2005), I examined the struggles of Chicanas/os with feminism, homosexuality, familia, masculinity, mysticism, the nationalist subject, and U.S.-Mexico border relations. Chicana/o novels register crucial new discourses of identity, politics, and cultural citizenship that cannot be understood apart from the historical instability following the demise of the nationalist politics of the Chicana/o movement of the 1960s and 1970s. In contrast to that time, when Chicanas/os sought a unified Chicano identity in order to effect social change, the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s have seen a disengagement from these nationalist politics and a new trend toward a heterogeneous sense of self. The detective novel and its traditional focus on questions of knowledge and identity turned out to be the perfect medium in which to examine this new self. My essays and books demonstrate a long-standing interest in aesthetics, textual politcs, and literary form.
