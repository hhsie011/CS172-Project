Sciences, MS Comparative Biomedical Sciences, PhD Veterinary Medicine, DVM Home/ College of Arts and Sciences/ Computer Science Computer Science Overview Courses Undergraduate Programs Graduate Programs Minors Faculty Computer science is concerned with theoretical and practical methods of storing, processing and communicating information by means of computing devices and computer networks. Professional computer scientists obtain a formal education through the BS, MS or PhD degrees and apply their knowledge to many diversified fields of science, engineering, business and communications. Computer science offers opportunities to both specialists and generalists. Within a short period of time, the computing field has evolved from one associated primarily with engineering and scientific calculations of only casual interest to the layperson, to a factor of significant influence in almost every aspect of modern life. Technical careers in computer architecture and software design, as well as applications in the business and scientific areas, require a thorough knowledge of the principles of computer science. In addition, most managers in any field require some familiarity with computers, not only to be able to understand them, but also to incorporate them into their own decision-making processes. The department offers the full range of degree programs—BS, MS and PhD. A graduate certificate program in big data analytics is also offered. All programs are offered in Stillwater. The BS is also offered on the Tulsa campus (upper-division courses only). Effective Spring 2020, students may choose to complete all BS degree requirements online. The Computer Science Department has a variety of computing resources, including a Linux cluster (big data lab), several Linux workstations, an iMac mobile app lab, robotics and graphics, and augmented and virtual reality labs. The systems are available to Computer Science students, faculty, and staff for both course assignments and research work. Graduate students have access to several research labs. The department also has a Collaborative Learning Laboratory for networking and group work. Computer Science students may pursue internships in various industries such as financial/banking, energy (oil, gas, and wind), medical, defense, aeronautical, and IT. The 4+1 program allows a student to apply 9 hours of computer science courses to both their BS and MS programs. Most BS and MS graduates obtain positions in industry. PhD graduates find university teaching and research positions or positions in industry. Computers can be accessed through the OSU Information Technology Division. There are a number of personal computer labs located in various buildings on campus. Some of the residence halls have personal computer labs available. All of these labs have access to personal computer application software and to all mainframe computers on campus, as well as Internet access. Both University and department computers can be accessed 24 hours a day. CS 1003 Computer Proficiency Description: For students with minimal personal computer skills.

Function effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the program’s discipline. Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing-based solutions. MS and PhD Programs The department offers degree programs in the Master of Science degree and the Doctor of Philosophy degree. These programs are designed to prepare an individual to pursue a career in either an academic or an industrial setting. In addition to taking a prescribed set of core courses, a student must take sufficient courses in one specialized area. A student must complete a dissertation for a PhD degree. The MS degree program provides a thesis option and a non-thesis option. The non-thesis option requires a student to complete a report. The core course requirement assures the student of breadth of knowledge in computer science; the freedom to choose an area and additional research provides the student enough depth in some facets of computer science to carry out independent investigations in those areas, and to put concepts and ideas learned to practical use. For a master's degree in the thesis option, 30 hours of graduate credit, including a six-credit-hour thesis, are required. For a master's degree in the non-thesis option, 33 hours of graduate credit, including a two-credit-hour report, are required. A master’s degree student in thesis option is required to pass an oral examination over the thesis. Students pursuing non-thesis option are required to present their work during an end of semester poster session. Students' advisory committee members may ask questions during the poster session or at another scheduled presentation time. For the PhD, 60 credit hours beyond a master's degree or 90 hours beyond a bachelor's degree are required. A dissertation of 15 to 40 hours (counting towards the maximum) is required. The PhD dissertation must describe original research. PhD students must pass (at an appropriate level) a diagnostic examination, a comprehensive examination, a qualifying examination and a final oral examination. The candidate's baccalaureate degree need not be in computer science in order to enter the MS program. Students with degrees in other areas may be admitted provisionally and required to take specified prerequisite courses. Graduate Certificate Program in Big Data Analytics The goal of the big data analytics program is to facilitate the capture, curation, storage, search, transfer, and analysis of large and complex data sets that have direct relevance to everyday situations and problems. The program covers core topics such as big data management, machine learning/data analytics and statistics. The graduate certificate in Big Data Analytics may be completed in conjunction with the master's degree in Computer Science.
