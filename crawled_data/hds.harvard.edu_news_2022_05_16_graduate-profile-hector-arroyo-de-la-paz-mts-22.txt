Memorable Moment I loved community tea, especially at the start of the school year when it was warm outside and everyone would sit on the lawn in front of Swartz eating, talking, and having a good time! Message of Thanks I want to thank my family. Without their sacrifices, hard work, and love, I would not be where I am today. I also want to thank the wonderful people I have befriended across Harvard, who have supported, cared for, and inspired me. Future Plans I plan to stay at Harvard and continue to serve the university’s first-generation, low-income, and undocumented student communities.
