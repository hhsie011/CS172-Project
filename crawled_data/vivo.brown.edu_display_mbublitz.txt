Full Text PubMed Research Research Overview In my area of research, I seek to understand the pathways linking psychological stress before and during pregnancy to adverse perinatal health. Specifically, I have two lines of research: 1) to understand the effects of maternal history of childhood maltreatment on maternal neurobiology in pregnancy and the postpartum periods, and 2) to examine if mindfulness interventions in pregnancy alter maternal psychological and biological pathways linked to adverse perinatal health. Paralleling my two areas of research, I have been appointed Research Member at the Research Institute for Stress, Trauma and Resilience (STAR) at Brown Medical School, and Senior Investigator at the Brown Center for Mindfulness within the School of Public Health. Results from my research have advanced the field by characterizing differences in neuroendocrine activity and immune functioning over pregnancy among women with histories of childhood maltreatment.
