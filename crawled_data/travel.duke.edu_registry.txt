Per the Duke Global Travel Policy, individuals traveling internationally with Duke Support - whether Student, Faculty, Staff, or Other (e.g., alumni, visiting scholars) - are required to enter travel dates, destination(s), supporting Duke unit(s), and emergency contact information into the Duke Travel Registry prior to departure. Further, all international travel must adhere to both the policy. If you have questions regarding the Global Travel Policy, please visit our answers to Frequently Asked Questions. Existing travel registrations can be updated or deleted by e-mailing globaltravel@duke.edu with the traveler's name, destination, and dates of travel.
