Tuition reimbursement provides ways for employees to stay current in their specialties and strive for continuous improvement. In This Guide: Qualifying for Tuition Reimbursement Tuition Reimbursement Benefit Steps to Use Tuition Reimbursement Resources Qualifying for Tuition Reimbursement Have you been employed continuously at Baylor for at least 90 days? Are you a regular (not temporary) faculty or staff member? If you answered 'yes' to both questions, you may qualify for tuition reimbursement. Tuition Reimbursement Benefit Eligible regular faculty/staff can receive 100 percent tuition reimbursement for one course during any semester (two summer sessions = one semester). A course for which tuition reimbursement is claimed must be a formal course provided for either academic credit, continuing education credit, or a certificate of completion. Program Parameters Enrollment in job-related courses must be pre-approved by the department budget head. An employee may be enrolled in either the Job-Related Tuition Reimbursement Program OR the Tuition Remission Program (BU-PP 450A) - not both. Employees are expected to attend courses outside of regular working hours unless special permission is obtained from the employee’s supervisor. The employee must be employed by the University for the entirety of the course. Steps to Apply for Tuition Assistance Read the Educational Assistance Plan and Job Related Tuition Reimbursement Program Policy. Complete the job-related tuition application and submit to the department budget head for approval. Prior to taking the class, submit the approved application to Human Resources for eligibility review. If eligibility is confirmed and once the course is completed, the employee should submit the following to Human Resources: Approved Job-Related Tuition Application Evidence of satisfactory completion of the course Receipt for tuition costs (fees are not covered) Resources-Tuition Reimbursement Educational Assistance Plan (PDF 81 KB) Educational Assistance Application (PDF 86 KB) Learn & Grow Courses Available Course Listings Course Creation Lifelong Learning Program Continuing Education Program Career Tools RightNow Media @ Work LinkedIn Learning Educational Assistance Tuition Remission Tuition Reimbursement Professional Wellbeing LinkedIn Learning Baylor Human Resources Putting people first.
