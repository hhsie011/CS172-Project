Social Justice Statement The CAAS rounds committee is committed to elevating the voices of underrepresented minority populations through speaker representation and content. We will prioritize research that focuses on health disparities, especially the impact of Substance Use Disorders/substance misuse in underrepresented populations. We are always looking for recommendations for researchers, at all career levels (i.e., postdoctoral fellows, early career, and established), who identify as part of an underrepresented minority group and/or conduct research with underrepresented minority populations. We enthusiastically accept self-nominations. Anti-Racist Content Statement The CAAS rounds committee urges all presenters to discuss issues of social justice and representation in their presentations. We will also actively work to condemn anti-black racist rhetoric or behavior at CAAS rounds and to critically critique our social justice efforts. Raffle Each week, CAAS Rounds also offers the opportunity for attendees to be entered into a drawing to win a raffle prize. Virtual prizes this semester will be Amazon gift cards!
