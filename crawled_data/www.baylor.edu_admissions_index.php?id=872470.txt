You must also select a major. When you fill out your application, you will be able to select a major and a pre-professional program. As a Pre-Law student at Baylor, you have the opportunity to explore the legal field while immersing yourself in the discipline of your choice, so students are encouraged to pick a course of study that inspires and challenges them. Students will have a Pre-Law academic advisor who will help them make informed decisions about courses that will prepare them for the LSAT and law school. GPA is the most important aspect of the application process for law school, so selecting a rigorous major in which the student will succeed is essential. Students often choose to enroll in the Honors College to ensure adequate academic preparation. Some majors have special degree plans geared towards students planning on attending law school including Philosophy, Economics, and Political Science. Many of the required courses for a Political Science degree include topics related to the practice of law. Planning for law school should begin as early as possible. One-on-one professional advising is available from the time you enter as a freshman so that you can begin to strategically position yourself for success. Regular workshops and speakers, connections with lawyer-alumni and internship opportunities will help you develop a realistic understanding of the legal profession and to begin to develop the skills you will need as a law student and lawyer. Baylor offers many resources to assist students with the planning process, including the Pre-Law Guidebook, which assists students in planning out their best ways to prepare for law school. Phi Alpha Delta is a student-led organization open to all students interested in a career in law. The purpose of the organization is to help students determine whether law school or a job in the legal career is right for them. The organization hosts LSAT prep events and invites speakers from a variety of fields to speak at meetings. Past speakers have included district attorneys and prep course instructors. The Baylor Law School is a large resource available to all Pre-Law undergraduate students. Each year, the Baylor Law School hosts several events that prepare students for the LSAT and the law school application process. Some of these events include a pre-law boot camp and Mock Trial competitions. These events give undergraduates the opportunity to volunteer and gain valuable experience.
