Message of Thanks In one of my first weeks at HDS, I heard from Kerry Maloney that we'd embark on the spiritual formation of the curate, the caretaker of souls. I've found, instead, my soul being taken care of at HDS. To my family, classmates, and professors, thank you for softening my heart and teaching me that grit and trust is faith. I am just so grateful.
