By definition, it is an integrative area of study drawing principally from cognitive science, psychology, neuroscience, and linguistics. There are two broad directions which can be taken in this concentration—one is behavioral/experimental and the other is computational/modeling. In either case, the goal is to understand the nature of cognition from a neural perspective. AP and Transfer Credits: Please refer to our departmental policy on applying AP and transfer credits. Concentration Requirements For the most up-to-date concentration requirements, please visit the Brown bulletin page or meet with your advisor.
