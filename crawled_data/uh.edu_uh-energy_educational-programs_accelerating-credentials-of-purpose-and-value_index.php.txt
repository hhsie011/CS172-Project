GEER dollars, in turn, originate from the U.S. Department of Education’s administration of the Education Stabilization Fund in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act of 2020. The University of Houston received an ACPV grant in February 2022, and UH Energy is coordinating the ACPV project within the University of Houston System. OBJECTIVE The objective of our ACPV project is to make the essential skills of data analytics more accessible to petrotechnical students, and to accelerate credentialing in this field, by integrating short-term, stackable, energy industry-specific programs in data analytics into existing graduate programs. APPROACH Our approach is based on the Upstream Energy Data Analytics micro-credential program, that we have been running since the summer of 2020. Key components of the of this program are the use of stackable badges, co-teaching by academic faculty and industry SMEs, pedagogy with real-world problems, and rigorous evaluation. Making it happen Four departments within the University of Houston System are deploying ACPV activities: The Department of Earth & Atmospheric Sciences (UH) The Department of Petroleum Engineering at the University of Houston (UH) The Department of Computer Science and Engineering Technology at the University of Houston Downtown (UHD) the Department of Computing Sciences at the University of Houston Clear Lake (UHCL) UH Energy is maintaining close contact with the departments, and with the Provost’s Office, to ensure that the ACPV objectives are achieved.
