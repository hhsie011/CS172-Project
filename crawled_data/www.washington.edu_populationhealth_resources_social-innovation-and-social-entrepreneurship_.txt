The concept of social innovation focuses on how to generate solutions that create social value, as well as the processes by which these solutions are generated. Social entrepreneurship implies building an organization that applies commercial strategies to improve human or environmental well-being, and values social impact alongside financial returns for external investors. The University of Washington offers a number of courses, programs and other resources to support students, researchers and members of the public in pursuing these mechanisms.
