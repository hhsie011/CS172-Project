Why did you get involved in your local chapter?: BC changed my life. My experiences there forced me to become my own person, introduced me to the best people, and opened my eyes to what's possible. What are your local favorites in your city?: I have visited 34 countries so far! Fun Fact: Running along Town Lake is my favorite thing to do in Austin. Sometimes I run to get tacos, mimosas, train for races, or to the good views to just decompress. There's no better place in the city than being by the water.
