This series of exhibitions takes the form of a lively conversation between artists across generations, mediums, backgrounds, and contexts—all responding to the question: what does LOVE look like to you right now? Artist-curator Rachel Stern manifested an immersive installation of artworks that encompassed visitors with the exquisite and overwhelming sensations of love. For 2020, Perfect Vision asked participating artists to give special consideration to the ways in which both biological and psychic vision contributes to the construction of LOVE, interacting with positions of power. LOVE 2020: Perfect Vision seeked to define the utterly indefinable, to name and image that which by its very nature is without form or fixed identity. 2020 feels both like an impossible future arrived too soon and a cold dead weight refusing to budge or give in to our hopes for what comes next. It is tempting to look away, but LOVE 2020: Perfect Vision says to the future, as Carly Rae Jepsen implores, “It’s hard to look right at ya baby. But here’s my number, so call me maybe?” Participating artists included David Altmejd, Roni Aviv, Mario Ayala, Pablo Barba, Oona Brangam-Snell, Dana Buhl, Michael Bühler Rose, Esteban Cabeza de Baca, Nathan Catlin, Peter Clough, Sean Downey, Christina Graham, gergsnewphone, Harry Gould Harvey IV, Phoebe Hinton, Heidi Howard, Cary Hulbert, Hypercomf, Bryan Jabs, Joseph Kaplan, Luke Kendall, Jon Kessler, Paul Legault, Matthew Leifheit, Cole Lu, Paula Lycan, Erik Marcel, Alexandra Rafael Martínez, Edward Mapplethorpe, Susan Metrican, Emily Oliveira, Oren Pinhassi, LJ Roberts, Adam Liam Rose, Yoshie Sakai, Pacifico Silano, Jacqueline Silberbush, Sandra Stark, Maia Stern, Stipan Tadic, Ika Trey, Tomas Vu, Julie Yeo.
