Its name was changed in 2007 when UC signed the American College and University Presidents' Climate Commitment (ACUPCC). The committee is composed of students, faculty, and staff and is open to all. PACES meets once a month to share updates on projects as well as new ideas. If you have an idea for a sustainability initiative on campus, this is a great place to share your idea, get feedback, and get others interested in your idea during our open discussion time. PACES has a Steering Committee that is co-chaired by Andy Porter, Director of Space Management and Joe Harrell, Associate VP of Facilites Management. For more information, please email us.
