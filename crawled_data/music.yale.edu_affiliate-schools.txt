Music at Yale enjoys a level of participation and excellence that is not limited to the activities of the School of Music, Department of Music, and Institute of Sacred Music. There are also numerous extracurricular music groups on campus. The Institute of Sacred Music The Yale Institute of Sacred Music, an interdisciplinary graduate center, educates leaders who foster, explore, and study engagement with the sacred through music, worship, and the arts in Christian communities, diverse religious traditions, and public life. Partnering with the Yale School of Music and the Yale Divinity School, the Institute prepares its students for careers in church music and other sacred music, pastoral ministry, performance, and scholarship. Music students who wish to pursue graduate work in programs in choral conducting, organ, composition, or voice (early music, oratorio, and chamber ensemble vocal track) must apply for and be accepted into one of the degree programs at the School of Music: master of music, master of musical arts, or doctor of musical arts. Institute students must be admitted to either the Yale School of Music or the Yale Divinity School (or both), from which they will eventually receive their degree. Performance opportunities include Yale Schola Cantorum and Yale Camerata. Visit the ISM The Department of Music The Department of Music partners with the School of Music to provide students a basic education in music at Yale. The Department teaches undergraduates in Yale College, providing instruction in music theory, music history, and music appreciation for music majors and nonmajors alike. At the same time, the Department offers graduate programs in music theory and musicology that lead to a Ph.D. degree. Graduate courses, all conducted as seminars, are taught by a distinguished faculty. Students at the School of Music can enroll in both undergraduate and graduate courses offered by the Department. Performance opportunities include the Yale Bands, Yale Glee Club, Yale Symphony Orchestra, Yale Baroque Opera Project, and more.
