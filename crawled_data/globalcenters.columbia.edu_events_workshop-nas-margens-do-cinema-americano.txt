As aulas pretendem focar em como certas visões históricas e estética específica se tornaram conhecidas como o American Independent Cinema. Embora o cinema americano - ou Hollywood - continue a dominar os mercados mundiais de filmes há mais de 100 anos, é importante analisarmos movimentos de cineastas independentes que tentaram se libertar do controle financeiro e modelo estético do cinema comercial, ao criarem suas próprias estruturas de produção. O American Independent Cinema marcou sua diferença em relação a Hollywood por seu uso de tecnologia cinematográfica; modo de produção; criação de plataformas especiais de distribuição e exibição; e abordagem cinematográfica à assuntos políticos. Durante o workshop 'Nas Margens do Cinema Americano', o Professor Richard Peña apresentará diferentes temas e perspectivas desse movimento em quatro aulas.: 14/08 das 18h às 21h30: O cinema Afro-Americano independente, 1915-1952 15/08 das 18h às 21h30: A Vanguarda Americana, 1943-1969 16/08 das 18h às 21h30: Um Neorrealismo Americano? 17/08 das 9h30 às 13h: New Left Cinema, 1960-1975 Richard Peña é Professor de cinema na School of the Arts da Columbia University, onde se especializou em cinema internacional e teoria do cinema. De 1988 a 2012 foi diretor do programa da Film Society no Lincoln Center e diretor do New York Film Festival. >> Valor do workshop: R$ 1.000,00 Upcoming Events Columbia Global CentersAmman / Beijing / Istanbul / Mumbai / Nairobi / Paris / Rio / Santiago / Tunis Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
