Fines (overdue/lost items) The due date for any given item is emailed to the borrower. On the day after this due date, fines begin to accrue. There is no grace period. Due date reminder notices are emailed 3 days before the due date and on the due date for material circulating for one week or more. Overdue notices are sent one day after the due date. These notices are sent as a courtesy; users are responsible for returning items if for any reason overdue notices are not received. Fines vary depending on whether the overdue item was recalled by another user, as summarized below. Fines are billed via ISU Accounts Receivable. For more detailed information regarding fines and other circulation policies, consult the complete ISU Library Lending Policy. For questions or help, contact the Circulation Desk, phone 515 294-3961; CircDesk@iastate.edu.
