Please bear with us as we are slowly adding to the website to best describe the new Certificate program. A rough overview of the new requirements is available here Many faculty from both engineering and architecture have worked hard to create an expanded program that truly encompasses the interdisciplinary nature of contemporary architecture and engineering. The new program facilitates certificate studies from any student, and is designed to support the full range of engineering and architectural cross-disciplinary interests. We look forward engaging a wide range of new students in this exciting intersection that extends far beyond just crossing Washington Road.
