As an educator, Debbie believes strongly in the power of transformative learning. She joined UC's University Honors Program (UHP) in 2004 as an assistant director and academic advisor. That same year, she transitioned into her current role of administrative director. Debbie’s responsibilities include implementing the vision and mission of the program through development and management of the curriculum, academic advising, international experiences, budget and day-to-day operations. Debbie was a recipient of UC's Just Community Award in 2010. Prior to working at UC, Debbie worked in Orientation and First Year Experience at James Madison University, where she was an All Together One honoree in 2002. In 2001, she was named the Outstanding New Professional by the National Orientation Directors Association. Debbie has presented on the regional and national levels and is a member of ACPA, NASPA and NACADA. Ask me about... The time I've spent on a river boat in the Brasilian Amazon My favorite city, New Orleans, and its city and people Why I'm a diehard sports fan and cheesehead Fun fact In college, I dressed up as the Skyline Chili mascot (hot dog and cheese outfit and all!) at a Crosstown Shootout event downtown. Twenty years from now, you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.
