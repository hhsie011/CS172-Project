SMU Dedman School of Law offers, in association with University College, an annual program, at University College. The program includes a tour of “Legal London,” as well as a visit to the UK Supreme Court. This program is part of SMU’s strong tradition of training lawyers, from the U.S. and abroad, to practice law in a global environment. Over 650 law students have participated in this summer program since its inception. Students earn five hours of credit by taking one course taught by an SMU professor and one Oxford-style tutorial taught by an Oxford tutor. Participants live and take their meals in historic University College, Oxford. The 2020 Oxford program will begin on Monday, June 29, 2020, and run through Saturday, August 1, 2020. As in the past, the number of students enrolled in the program will be kept small. Thirty-six students will be accepted to attend the program. The small class sizes encourage a sense of community and allow active participation of all students. Enrollment has varied in recent years from 32 to 36 students. The program is limited to students enrolled in SMU Dedman School of Law. 2016 Oxford Program - UK Supreme Court Study Abroad in Oxford 2020 Oxford Program at a Glance Oxford Application Calendars Oxford Costs Oxford Course Information Oxford Facilities Oxford Faculty Attendance and Class Preparation Cancellation, Withdrawl and Refund Policy Oxford Student Guide Useful Links to Oxford Information Library Business Office Get Help Now News Media Emergency / Safety Admissions Office / FAQs Department Directory Consumer Information (ABA Required Disclosures) Contact Us Maps and Directions Legal Disclosures © SMU Dedman School of Law 3315 Daniel Avenue, Dallas, TX 75205 facebook google twitter linkedin tumblr youtube instagram
