At the BE level, students deepen their theoretical and analytic work while simultaneously applying their engineering skills to problems in the industrial workplace. The program examples below show the typical foundations plus advanced courses for specific engineering fields. On This Page Biomedical Engineering Biological Engineering Chemical Engineering Computer Engineering Computer Science Electrical Engineering Energy Engineering Environmental Engineering Material Science and Engineering Mechanical Engineering Physics Questions? Biomedical Engineering Biomedical engineering is the broad area of study in which engineers use an interdisciplinary approach to solve problems in the medical field, oftentimes associated with the interaction between living and non-living systems. The breadth of solution methodologies requires biomedical engineers to take a quantitative approach to system analysis in “traditional” engineering fields, while simultaneously employing a fundamental understanding of the relevant life sciences. Biomedical engineers should be prepared to design, build, test, and/or analyze biological systems, diagnostics, devices, and treatment modalities. Examples of current areas of research and education include: Biomechanics (Scaling from systems to tissues, cells, and molecules) Biomedical imaging Biomaterials and Tissue engineering Cardiovascular engineering Biophotonics Neural engineering Orthopedic engineering Biomedical instrumentation and devices A variety of logical, interdisciplinary course sequences allow thematic approaches to the above areas (e.g. biology-based, physics-based, computer-based, mechanics/materials-based, etc.). Individuals wishing to explore biological approaches are encouraged to reference the description for Biological Engineering and perhaps enroll in ENGS 35 to gain exposure to this space. Recommended Courses ENGS 34, 35, 36 PHYS 19 MATH 22, 23 CHEM 41, 51/57, 52/58 BIOL 40 ENGS 56, 57/169, 59, 111, 129, 160, 165, 166, 167, 168, 170 As appropriate: Fundamental Electrical Engineering, Control, Mechanical Engineering, Bioengineering, Design, Computer Engineering, and Neuropsychology courses to provide tools for solving problems in the above-mentioned courses. Individuals wishing to explore biological approaches are encouraged to reference the description for Biotechnology and enroll in ENGS 35 to gain exposure to this space. Biological Engineering Biological engineering exists at the interface of engineering, biological, and chemical sciences. This interdisciplinary field brings to bear fundamental design principles to both elucidate and modulate the function of biological systems, ranging in scale from molecular to cellular to whole organisms. The bioengineer’s toolbox may include skills such as modeling, big data analysis, genetics, process design, biochemistry, and molecular, micro, and cellular biology. By designing, engineering, and optimizing biological systems, bioengineers and biotechnologists are seeking to tackle key unmet needs in medicine, agriculture, industry, the environment, consumer markets, etc. Recommended Courses (assumes ENGS 35/160 taken as Gateway) ENGS 34, 58, 59, 161, 162, 157, 158, 165 COSC 75, 86, 89(For topically relevant courses.)

A computer engineer understands the hardware, software, and applications environment of computing systems. As a result, computer engineers must be familiar with computer architectures, networks, and applications software as well as modeling and analysis techniques for such systems including machine learning, complex systems, and artificial intelligence.

The overarching objective is to protect the environment and ensure sustainability. Problems and challenges are typicaly of two types, (1) post-technology remediation or treatment, and (2) prevention or reduction of impacts by environmentally conscious design. A systems approach prevails in both types. The environmental engineer is quintessentially an interdisciplinary engineer.

In turn, the structure is related to processing-- solidification, thermal/mechanical treatment, vapor deposition, and so forth-- and to the underlying thermodynamic "driving forces" and kinetics that underlie changes in structure and hence in properties and behavior.
