Through careful planning with their academic advisors, students can complement their undergraduate degree with experiences such as study abroad, internship, and service learning. By graduating in four years, students can reduce their tuition costs and accelerate their entry into the job market or advanced education compared to students who take more than eight semesters to graduate. The program encourages students to work collaboratively with their academic advisor to make strategic academic decisions about which courses to take each semester. Students wanting to graduate in four years under the Soar in 4: Four-Year Graduation Guarantee are expected to: Keep in close contact with their Iowa State academic advisor, who will guide students’ academic decisions and keep students up-to-date with university policies and procedures. Take required courses at the times they are available. Maintain student registration at ISU during off-campus experiences. Register for classes promptly and monitor academic progress on a regular basis by reviewing the degree audit with their advisor. Iowa State University will provide the academic advising services and degree-audit mechanisms to assist students in accurately monitoring progress toward graduation. ISU is also responsible for providing class space in the courses required for the student's respective major in order to complete a bachelor's degree within eight consecutive semesters. Additional information about the Four-Year Graduation Guarantee can be found at: http://www.provost.iastate.edu/academic-programs/soarin4 Four-year (eight-semester) templates for ISU programs of study Iowa State University offers over 100 majors in six undergraduate colleges. All but two programs, architecture and landscape architecture, may be completed in four years. ISU's bachelor degree programs require from 120 to 144 credits; therefore, students must average between 15 and 18 credits per semester. To assist students in creating their own personal four-year academic plans, eight-semester templates are provided for all programs of studies covered by the Soar in 4 program.
