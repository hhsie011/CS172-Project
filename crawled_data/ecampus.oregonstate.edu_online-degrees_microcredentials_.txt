Start your tour » Microcredentials – Online Give your résumé a powerful boost Give yourself the specialized skills you need to take your career to a higher level by earning a microcredential online with Oregon State University. As a respected and nationally ranked leader in online education, Oregon State Ecampus delivers microcredentials in these areas: Business of viral content creation Content development and production Engineering management (graduate level) Engineering mechanics Engineering project management (graduate level) Intermediate Spanish Introductory Spanish Organizational leadership Professional readiness Programming fundamentals What is a microcredential? Oregon State’s microcredentials are high-quality educational opportunities that can help advance your career with less time and financial commitment than a formalized degree or certificate program. All Oregon State microcredentials consist of at least three courses and 8 credits that follow Oregon State’s quarterly term calendar. Proudly display your digital badge Once you complete the requirements, you’ll receive a digital badge that demonstrates evidence of your discipline-specific knowledge to employers. Oregon State's Office of the Registrar will upload your information to Credly, the world's largest digital credential network, within three weeks of completing your final class. Though the microcredential badge will not appear on your university transcript, academic courses will appear on your transcript, and the badge can be placed on your résumé and on LinkedIn or other social media platforms. Who can enroll? Microcredentials are available to nondegree-seeking students, undergraduates, graduates, nontraditional students and working professionals. With the exception of graduate-level microcredentials which require a bachelor’s degree, it’s not necessary to have a college degree in order to apply, but some microcredential courses have prerequisites. All course credits used to complete a microcredential must be completed in academic residence at Oregon State. If you are a current OSU student, you must complete at least one of the microcredential courses after having been accepted into the microcredential. Visit the webpage of your microcredential(s) of interest to learn more about courses and prerequisites. Courses are linked to the Ecampus schedule of classes, which will show any applicable prerequisites and term offerings. Here's how to apply You can apply to Oregon State as a nondegree student if you are not currently enrolled at OSU. A nonrefundable fee ($30 for undergraduate applicants; $35 for graduate applicants) is due when you submit your application. Find more details about the online learning experience for Oregon State’s nondegree students. Receive support from start to finish Even as a nondegree-seeking student, you’ll have access to the same support resources as all other Oregon State students. The OSU Ecampus student services team is here to support you, and you can tap into resources like free online tutoring, OSU’s Disability Access Services, OSU Libraries and Canvas support. Start on a pathway to a degree or certificate Acceptance into a microcredential does not guarantee acceptance into a degree or certificate program. However, credits you earn toward a microcredential may apply to an Oregon State bachelor’s degree, master’s degree or graduate certificate. If you are planning to pursue a degree or certificate, we encourage you to reach out to your academic program of interest first to learn about those requirements. If you are interested in stacking an undergraduate microcredential(s) into a bachelor’s degree program, at least 45 of your last 75 credits must be completed as a degree-seeking student in an OSU program. If you are interested in stacking a graduate microcredential(s) into a graduate program, please review policies governing all graduate programs. Specifically, up to 22 graduate credits may be transferred toward a 45-credit master's degree. Up to 9 graduate credits may be transferred toward an 18-credit graduate certificate. Questions?
