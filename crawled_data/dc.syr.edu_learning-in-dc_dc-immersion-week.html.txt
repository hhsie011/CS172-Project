A collaboration among SU in DC, Syracuse University Career Services, the Office of Alumni Engagement, and local alumni, the program offers behind-the-scenes tours; corporate, government, and nonprofit site visits; and access to key alumni leaders, highlighting the cultural and professional opportunities available in the DC, Maryland, and northern Virginia region. Since its launch in 2012, alumni involvement in this prestigious program has tripled. Several students have landed summer internships through contacts made during the week, and some have returned to DC for the Washington Semester Program. Others have gained insight and clarity in choosing a major and minor course of study. DC Immersion Experience 2022 After many years of bringing students to DC and Baltimore for DC Immersion Week, this year, we’re bringing the immersion experience to you with a reimagined on-campus program open to all students, including an in-person career workshop, networking reception, and industry conversations featuring alumni from DC, Maryland, and Virginia representing popular industries in the region. For more information on the DC Immersion Experience 2022, visit the event page. View the list of this year's participating alumni panelists [PDF].
