We look forward to welcoming all Cornell families October 21-23, 2022 for Family Weekend! Future-year dates for Family Weekend will be released approximately six months before the event. Unlike Family Orientation, the schedule for Family Weekend will vary each day with most activities taking place on Friday and Saturday. Families are welcome to attend all or some events during the weekend. Recordings for some of our 2021 Family Weekend events are available now. Please adhere to the Cornell University guidelines in regards to COVID-19.
