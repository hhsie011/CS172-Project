Training, consulting, coaching, tip sheets and toolkits will be provided as resources towards this goal. The three phases of this initiative are: Resilience: responding well to disruptive change. Recovery: overcoming challenges, experimenting with new approaches, and regaining productivity. Renewal: applying learnings, innovating, and emerging stronger. New resources are being created and shared often. Please check back on a regular basis as we will update the resources as new information becomes available.
