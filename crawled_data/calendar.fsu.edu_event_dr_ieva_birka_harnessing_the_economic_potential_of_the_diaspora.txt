Her talk, focused on her five-year long research project into developed country relations with their expatriate populations, or diasporas, will be multidisciplinary, offering insights into the fields of migration studies, political science, economics, geography, policy planning and psychology. As the global competition for a workforce increases and individuals become more globally mobile, the governments of not only developing but also developed countries have taken notice and are eager to harness the knowledge, skills, networks, investments, and political influence of the diaspora. Further, the diffusion of western values through diaspora circular or return migration can do much to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in countries coming to grips with such issues.
