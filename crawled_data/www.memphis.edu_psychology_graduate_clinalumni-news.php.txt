Her research investigates how the intersection of gender-based violence, mental health and substance use influences HIV-related behaviors among minority populations and explores how to increase the sustainability of HIV prevention interventions.

Prior to joining RTI, Courtney completed an NIMH-funded T-32 postdoctoral fellowship at Yale University's Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS.

She also worked extensively in the Department of Psychology and in Infectious Diseases at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital as a research assistant. In the Memphis community, Courtney co-led initiatives to improve mental health services received by individuals living with HIV and mentored young girls in the Westwood community.
