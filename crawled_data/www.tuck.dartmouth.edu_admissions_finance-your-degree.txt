"I’ve formed relationships with classmates, professors, and staff at Tuck that I truly consider invaluable and life-long. It sounds trite, but both personally and professionally Tuck has changed my trajectory for the better, and you really can’t put a price on that. Tuck is a once in a lifetime experience, so my outlook has been to be responsible with my money, but also know that there are always creative solutions to make the Tuck experience that I want for myself possible."
