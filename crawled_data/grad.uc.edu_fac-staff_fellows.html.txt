In addition to their outstanding individual accomplishments, Fellows are generally among the most experienced and accomplished graduate-student mentors at the University. New Fellows are elected annually by the current Fellows and then appointed for life by the Board of Trustees. Criteria for election include evidence of outstanding scholarly and/or artistic attainment. The Fellows therefore constitute a significant resource of talent, experience and intellect at the university. While election is intended partly to honor distinguished faculty, Fellows meet regularly to discuss matters arising at the university, and the Fellows have functioned in important advisory roles in graduate education and research, including planning and development. Fellows are also called upon regularly to provide feedback on new initiatives and review research proposals at all levels of the university.
