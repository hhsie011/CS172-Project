As a student in this highly selective program, you will complete all the regular PhD requirements along with additional studies that prepare you for the opportunity to build an enterprise based on technical innovation. On This Page Overview Student Testimonials Program Requirements Program Comparison Admissions Questions? Request Info Loading... × Visit Apply Overview Acceptance into the PhD-I program comes with up to 5 years of full financial support. The first 2 years you will be supported as a graduate research assistant by your dissertation research advisor. Following satisfactory performance, you will receive up to 3 years of unrestricted program funding to allow you to follow your ideas independent of your advisor’s funded research program and to build the skill necessary to build an enterprise — such as a start-up company, a new division of an established company, or a government or non-profit enterprise. From the Director Hear from program director Eric Fossum, Professor of Engineering, Associate Provost of Dartmouth's Office of Entrepreneurship and Technology Transfer, Queen Elizabeth Prize Laureate, and inventor of the CMOS active pixel image sensor used in almost all cell-phone cameras. Sensor Science, Technology & Innovation Track Sensors impact the lives of nearly every human being, and new and emerging sensor technologies are key for scientific discovery. This track — supported by NSF's National Research Traineeship (NRT) program — is for entrepreneurially-minded graduate student researchers focused on sensor technology applications and commercialization. Surgical Innovation Track The Program also offers the option of a Training Program in Surgical Innovation (TPSI) — or "surgical innovation track" — for students wanting to focus on innovations that improve the safety and outcomes of surgical procedures. Hear more from Keith Paulsen, the Robert A. Pritzker Professor of Biomedical Engineering. Information Webinar We occasionally host a webinar for students interested in learning more about the Program. Please email us if you would like to be notified about upcoming sessions. You can also view a recently recorded webinar. Student Testimonials View the selection below or browse the full PhD-I Program video playlist. Amogha Tadimety & Alison Burklund Geneva Trotter Regina Salvat Austin Boesch Zhiyuan Wang Steven Reinitz Program Requirements Admitted students work with a special advisory committee to see that all of the following PhD-I Program requirements are met: 8–10 courses in applied mathematics and engineering sciences (see below) PhD Program Requirements First-year PhD Students Requirements PhD-I Program Plan Applied Mathematics (choose 2 courses) ENGS 91: Numerical Methods in Computation ENGS 92: Fourier Transforms and Complex Variables ENGS 93: Statistical Methods in Engineering ENGS 100: Methods in Applied Mathematics I ENGS 104: Optimization Methods for Engineering Applications ENGS 105: Computational Methods for Partial Differential Equations I ENGS 106: Numerical Linear Algebra Innovation (4 courses) ENGM 180: Accounting and Finance ENGM 187: Technology Innovation and Entrepreneurship typically taken in 2nd year of PhD program ENGM 188: Law for Technology and Entrepreneurship or equivalent course ENGG 321: Advanced Innovation and Entrepreneurship Engineering Specialization (4 courses) Courses in the student's area of research, chosen to increase depth of knowledge and expertise. These courses should be selected in concert with the thesis advisor. Innovation Elective (1 course - minimum) One or more graduate-level technical courses outside the student’s area of expertise. Professional Skills Development (required each term enrolled) ENGG 195: Seminar on Science, Technology, and Society (4 terms) ENGG 197: PhD Professional Workshops (recommended but not required; can be used to write a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) proposal) ENGG 198: Research-in-Progress Workshop (annual participation) Internship (1 course - minimum) To gain first-hand familiarity with how technology innovation is implemented in companies, students will arrange a full-time internship (ENGG 300) for a period of three to six months. The company must be engaged in some facet of technology innovation. Under special circumstances, students may be allowed to work on their own startup. Students with significant prior experience in a company may request waiver of the internship requirement. While students are on their internship, paid (normal) or unpaid, they will not receive a stipend. They will be eligible for health insurance through Dartmouth if they request it. Prior to starting the internship, students must see Lori Laventure (Cummings Hall, Rm. 135A). Also see the course requirements for ENGG 300.
