RANDALL “At the University of Utah, we have a philosophy of: Imagine…then do. It’s why we call it Imagine U. Today, I want to tell you what that means to me, and how it will shape my leadership. Imagine, is one of the most powerful and evocative words in the English language. Why? Because it evokes something personal and aspirational to everyone who hears it and follows its call. A call to become our best versions of ourselves. A call to ensure everyone feels a sense of belonging. A call to be a part of something larger than ourselves. A call to make the world a better place. In this auditorium today there are hundreds of different versions of imagine. Think about what yours is.” – March 23, 2021 Watch Inaugural Address Inauguration Recap Operation Bold Transition Plan Strategy 2025 Invite President Randall to an event News & statements Students: Meet with President Randall About President Randall Taylor R.
