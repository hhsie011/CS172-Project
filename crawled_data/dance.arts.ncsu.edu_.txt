Members of the State Dance Company created On Their Shoulders, an original screendance, in the fall of 2020. The collaborative work is a reflection on the collective power of women in civil leadership and the legacy of voting rights. Blending both political and domestic imagery, the company presented this piece as a reflection on the privilege to vote and the power to create lasting change. The work premiered on the eve of the 2020 presidential election and contributed to the Concert From Your Couch series as well as a Lunchbox Series, “Students In Response – The Election and Political Climate.” Recent News | Read more...
