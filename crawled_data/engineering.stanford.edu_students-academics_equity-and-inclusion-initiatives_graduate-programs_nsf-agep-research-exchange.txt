Participants learn new research techniques, engage in collaborative discussion for innovative problem solving, explore other labs, and benefit from face-to-face interaction with faculty. The NSF Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (NSF-AGEP) Research Exchange Program connects graduate students and postdocs with faculty members and research scientists from nine participating universities (Stanford, UC Berkeley, Caltech, Harvard, UCLA, University of Michigan, University of Texas Austin, University of Washington, and Georgia Tech). The goals of the program are to promote cross-institutional exchange between students, postdocs, and faculty across the alliance institutions, aid students in their search for postdoctoral mentors, help researchers identify future collaborators, and welcome students and postdocs into the broader engineering and scientific network. Program Details The alliance matches students and postdocs with faculty hosts in their areas of research and provides funding for them to visit the other participating institutions of their choosing. This gives students the chance to present their work and ideas, learn new techniques and approaches in other research groups, engage in collaborative discussions and innovation, and broaden their perspective and career opportunities. Visits are normally expected to last about 3-7 days, and travel and accommodation support will be up to $1,500, in the form of travel reimbursement. Eligibility Current Stanford graduate students and postdocs who are in Astronomy, Mathematics, Statistics, Chemistry & Chemical Biology, Earth & Planetary Sciences, Physics, and all School of Engineering & Applied Science disciplines are eligible for the program. The eligibility criteria are set forth in the NSF Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (NSF-AGEP). At the time of the visit, you must have an active Stanford appointment. Please note: The Research Exchange can only accept applications from U.S. citizens. Our partner, PPFP, considers applications from U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and other scholars who are legally authorized to work in the United States. Questions? For any questions related to the NSF-AGEP Research Exchange Program, please email Lourdes Andrade (she/her), Director of Equity and Inclusion Initiatives, at lourdesa@stanford.edu.
