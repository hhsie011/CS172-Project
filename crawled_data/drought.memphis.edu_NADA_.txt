This web application provides access to summer (June-August) reconstructions of the self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) on a 0.5Â° latitude/longitude grid centered over North America from AD 0000-2005. The reconstructions are derived from 1,845 tree-ring chronologies. For further details on the reconstructions, see Cook et al. (2010, link below). Maps and time series can be created using tools under the "Maps" and "Time Series" menus, respectively. For details on how to create maps and time series, see the "Help" menu. An animation that runs through each year of the reconstruction from AD 0000-2005 is available via the link below.
