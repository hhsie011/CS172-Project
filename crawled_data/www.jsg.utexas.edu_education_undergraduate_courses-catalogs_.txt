These courses include at least one of the three major introductory courses, with variations depending on a student’s degree track. Other fundamental courses cover earth materials, sedimentary rocks, the introduction to field & stratigraphic methods, and structural geology. Most undergraduates also take part in either the six-week summer field trip, Geology 660, or a comparable field course. In addition to their geological science courses, Jackson School undergraduates must fulfill course requirements outside the Department. These include courses essential to the mathematical and scientific skills needed to become a geoscientist, such as advanced calculus and chemistry, as well as general course requirements for the university in English, history, foreign language, and other areas.
