I'll never forget staying up, waiting for the sun to come up with the other ladies in my Mod, my friends, and my boyfriend. We brought blankets and pillows and camped out on the top of the garage to watch what ended up being a beautiful sunrise on our last day on campus. Why did you get involved in your local chapter?: Moving to Cleveland after graduation, I was looking for a way to meet new friends and network. To help with this, I immediately connected with the local Boston College chapter and started attending events. It was a great way to meet new people, and I enjoyed getting involved and helping connect with other local alumni. I love helping organize the chapter's service event(s) and annual Adopt a Family program. It's great to give back to the local Cleveland community, while also staying connected to my alma mater. What are your local favorites in your city?: Exploring the MetroParks, visiting the zoo with my two kids, running/walking along Shaker Lakes, and running in local races like the Cleveland half marathon. Fun Fact: I'm originally from Upstate New York. After graduating from BC, I moved to Cleveland, knowing only one person at the time. I fell in love with the city. I'm married to my college sweetheart (fellow BC '07 classmate) and we have two kids.
