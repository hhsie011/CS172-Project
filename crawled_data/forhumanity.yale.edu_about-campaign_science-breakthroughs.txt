Your Impact Give Now Science for Breakthroughs Breadcrumb Home / About the Campaign / Science for Breakthroughs Science for Breakthroughs At Yale, we believe that humanity’s most complex issues can be solved by human ingenuity. As we increase our ability to measure, model, and manipulate the building blocks of our world, we step closer to transformative solutions—medical breakthroughs, new materials and industrial methods, a sustainable food supply, improved transportation, answers to climate change, and more. Science feeds a pipeline of innovation that can improve millions, even billions, of lives. At Yale, our faculty members and students tackle critical questions on the most promising frontiers—from data science to quantum mechanics, from neuroscience to immunobiology, and across every area of environmental study. Their answers expand the sum of our knowledge, uncover powerful new insights, and shed light on a brighter tomorrow for all people. Investing for Impact Science Priorities Asked to identify areas of science that will have the greatest impact on society, Yale scientists named five disciplines—data science, quantum science, neuroscience, inflammation science, and environmental science—where strategic investment could lead to life-changing discoveries.
