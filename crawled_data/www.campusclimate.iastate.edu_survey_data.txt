Before submitting a request, please consider the following: Consult the full report before requesting data. Your questions may be answered in the report. Consult the survey instrument to determine what analyses are possible. We can only provide information on these items. If the response rate is lower than 30% for a demographic item (gender, race, etc.,) or a survey item, we might not provide the data. Requests for student data might not be approved due to low response rates. To protect confidentiality, you may be asked to submit an IRB form if you wish to conduct your own research. If your data request is approved, you will be asked to submit your final report to the Office of Institutional Research for archiving and sharing how survey data is used to improve the campus climate.
