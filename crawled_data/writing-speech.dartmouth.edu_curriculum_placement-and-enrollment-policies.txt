Through the first-year writing courses, the College offers entering students a valuable opportunity to develop the thinking, research, writing, and presentation abilities that characterize intellectual work in the academy and in educated public discourse. This page explains the options that students have for fulfilling the first-year writing requirement and the first-year seminar requirement: First-year Writing Choices. More information Directed Self-Placement Process for First-year Writing Courses In June, all entering students must complete a directed self-placement process for first-year writing courses, a process that helps students select among the various writing courses that fulfill the first-year writing requirement. Students will receive more information about this process in June and will have three weeks to answer a questionnaire, read a few articles, and compose a brief essay. Our faculty will then make a recommendation that will help students with a final decision about which writing course to take. This page more fully explains this directed self-placement process: First-year Writing Choices. Differences Among First-year Writing Courses This page explains the differences among the courses that fulfill the first-year writing requirement: Differences Among First-year Writing Courses FAQ Directed Self-Placement Process for Writing Courses This page answers commonly asked questions about the directed self-placement process for first-year writing courses: FAQ page Humanities 1-2 Humanities 1-2 is an interdisciplinary, two-term, two-credit course sequence for first-year students offered only in fall and winter terms. Completion of both terms of Humanities 1-2 is another way to satisfy the first-year writing requirement and first-year seminar requirement. Students interested in applying to take Humanities 1-2 must fill out the application form on the Humanities 1-2 program website by June 29. For details, please see the Humanities 1-2 Program website at: https://www.dartmouth.edu/hums1-2/ Registration for Writing 5 or Writing 2-3 Students taking Writing 2-3 are pre-registered for Writing 2 before they arrive on campus in fall. Students taking Writing 5 are assigned to take the course either in the fall or winter; this assignment cannot be changed. Writing 5 term assignment information appears on the student's placement record in the information that is visible to the student and the student's advisor just before first-year students register for fall term. Students register for Writing 5 during the normal course election process when they choose their other courses for a term. More information Registration for First-Year Seminars First-Year Seminars offer every first-year student an opportunity to participate in a course structured around intensive writing, independent research, small group discussion, and reading across the disciplines. A First-Year Seminar is taken in the term immediately following completion of the first-year writing requirement. During the normal course registration process for the upcoming term, students who are scheduled to take a First-Year Seminar review the First-Year Seminars offered and elect/request the seminar they prefer, along with their other course elections. More information FAQ First-year Writing Course Registration Follow this link to a page of frequently asked questions and answers about how to register for first-year writing courses. Transfer Credit Transfer students may request approval of transfer credit for WRIT 5, First-Year Seminar, or Speech courses based on courses taken at other colleges or universities before matriculation at Dartmouth. The deadline for all requests for credit is the end of the first term of study, but it is strongly recommended that students submit requests for Writing 5 transfer credit as early as possible, before registration for winter term begins, since transfer students who do not receive transfer credit for Writing 5 are assigned to take winter Writing 5.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Institute for Writing and Rhetoric Philosophy & Aims About Writing at Dartmouth Speech at Dartmouth Our Stories The Story of Writing Instruction at Dartmouth The Story of Speech at Dartmouth The Story of Writing Support at Dartmouth Curriculum Overview Writing Courses Writing 2-3 WRIT 5 First-Year Seminars Humanities 1-2 Speech Courses Speech 20 Speech 25 Speech 26 Speech 27 Speech 30 Speech 31 Speech 33 Speech 34 Speech 36 Speech 37 Speech 40 Placement and Enrollment Policies First-Year Writing & First-Year Seminar Requirements Differences Among First-Year Writing Courses FAQ Directed Self-Placement Process for Writing Registration for Writing 5 or Writing 2-3 Registration for First Year Seminars FAQ First-year Writing Registration First-year Writing Choices Prizes Writing Prize Winners Speech Contest Winners Speech Contest Call for Entries Learning Overview Writing Center Make an Appointment Materials Sources and Citations at Dartmouth Teaching Overview Guidelines Teaching Writing in the First Year Expectations for Writing 2-3 Expectations for Writing 5 Teaching the First-Year Seminar First-Year Writing: Pedagogies, Methods, & Design Active Learning in the First-Year Writing Classroom Syllabus and Assignment Design Teaching Writing as Process Integrating Reading and Writing Diagnosing and Responding to Student Writing Conducting Writing Workshops Collaborative Learning/Learning with Peers Teaching Argument Teaching Research Addressing Grammar Useful links Support The Writing Assistant Program Research Past Research Activities Research Overview Multilingual Overview Support for Undergraduate Students Support for Graduate Students Faculty Support News & People People News Employment Upcoming Events Past Events My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
