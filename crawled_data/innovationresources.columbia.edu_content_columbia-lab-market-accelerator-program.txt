Since 2008, Columbia University has founded or co‐founded multiple accelerator programs encompassing medical technologies, clean energy technologies, therapeutics, and digital media, providing resources to foster the development of concepts and companies that have subsequently raised more than $218M in additional funding. The experience building and improving these programs yielded a powerful set of insights and best practices now leveraged through L2M‐ a collective model for providing core infrastructure and resources to programs supporting early stage university teams as they move technologies forward. With core competencies from the Network, participating industry‐specific programs are able to focus on the provision of expertise to scientific teams.
