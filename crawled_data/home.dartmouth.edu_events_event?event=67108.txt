Thus, quantum tunneling is the primary mechanism behind fusion reactions. Even so, a plasma with a Maxwell-Boltzmann energy distribution requires heating to temperatures of ~10^8 K before fusion is reliably achieved. This high temperature threshold poses a multifaceted challenge to the development of fusion reactors. Non-Maxwellian “kappa” distributions have long been of interest in the empirical study of space plasmas, and their deviation from a Maxwellian distribution at certain energy ranges could lead to enhanced predictions for tunneling rates at lower temperatures. In this thesis, a numerical approximation scheme is developed to compute the quantum-mechanical tunneling coefficient of a particle incident upon the Coulombic barrier, such that the reactivity of a kappa-distributed nuclear plasma can be computed.
