Newsletters Search Enter a keyword Search DDC Students Visit NYU On February 23, 2017, twenty Double Discovery students attended the first of two annual “backyard” college tours sponsored the Macquarie Group Foundation. The goal of these trips is to show students the many college opportunities right nearby. In the morning, the group gathered at DDC and took the subway from Morningside to NYU, where they went on a campus tour and attended an information session led by admissions officers. Students positively remarked on the opportunities for conducting research with professors and also on NYU’s “gigantic library.” After NYU, the students road uptown for a visit to the observation deck at the Empire State Building. Students enjoyed spying recognizable sites like Central Park, from over 1,000 feet above. It was the first visit to both places - NYU and the Empire State Building - for nearly all participants. Preeti Gurung, a sophomore at Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics, noted that “DDC always plans good trips!” DDC Recent News 1 March 2019 - 11:03am DDC Appoints New Board of Friends Chair, Looks to the Future 11 January 2018 - 11:19am The Roger Lehecka Double Discovery Center Appoints New Executive Director 17 July 2017 - 5:09pm Columbia Scholars Lead DDC's Middle School Summer Program 11 July 2017 - 3:41pm Upward Bound Summer Academy Underway 15 June 2017 - 12:43pm Macquarie LEADS Program Kicks Off Summer See all News The Double Discovery Center Phone: (212) 854-3897 Fax: (212) 854-7457 ddc@columbia.edu Location Alfred Lerner Hall, Rm. 306 2920 Broadway, MC 2604 New York, NY 10027 Follow DDC DDC Facebook Page DDC on Twitter DDC on YouTube DDC on LinkedIn Join our Mailing List © 2022 Columbia University | Terms of Use | Accessibility | Notice of Non-Discrimination |University Home Page
