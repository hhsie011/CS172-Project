Undergraduate Admission uses email and your admission portal as the ONLY communications tools for admission related updates. Please check your email settings to be sure emails from admission@gatech.edu can be safely delivered to your account. Step 1: Admission Portal As an applicant, your admission portal is the primary portal where you can: Check your admission application status. Track receipt of admission documents. View your admission decision. This account uses your email address as the username. SAMPLE USERNAME: gpburdell1@email.com How to Set Up Your Admission Portal: First-year applicants will receive an email with instructions to activate their portal the next day following submission of their application. All other applicants (transfer/non-degree/dual enrollment) will set up their portal when starting an application for admission. Access Admission Portal Step 2: GT Account Your GT account is used to access almost all other GT systems. This account uses a system generated account username and a password. SAMPLE USERNAME: gpburdell1 How to Set Up Your GT Account: Please allow up to one week after the submission of an application to activate the GT Account or to see an indication in your Admission Portal that you are ready to activate. Around major application deadlines (i.e. October 15 and January 1), it may take up to two weeks. Visit Passport to activate your GT Account (note: you only need your name and birth date to activate your account). You will be assigned a GT Account username and will then create your GT Account password. Please keep this information in a safe location. After activating your account, please allow one (1) business day before accessing other GT systems, such as Oscar and BuzzPort.
