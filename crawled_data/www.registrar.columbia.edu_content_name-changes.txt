For this reason, beginning in the Spring 2016 semester, the University will enable students to use a “Preferred Name” where possible in the course of University business and education. Under Columbia’s “Preferred Name” policy, any current student may choose to identify a Preferred First and/or Middle Name in addition to the Legal Name. Students may request this service via a link on SSOL. All requests are reviewed by the University Registrar’s Office. Note: If you have a preferred name in SSOL and submit a subsequent legal name change, you must delete your preferred name in SSOL in order for the new legal name to appear. To learn more about Columbia’s “Preferred Name” Policy, read our Frequently Asked Questions. Name Changes NameCoach Withhold or Reverse Withholding...
