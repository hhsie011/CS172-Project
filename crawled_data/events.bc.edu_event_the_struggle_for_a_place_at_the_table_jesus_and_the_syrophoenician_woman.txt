Register here The dismissive response by Jesus in Mark 7:24-30 to the Syrophoenician woman’s request has left many struggling to explain the dynamics of this interaction. Traditionally, the story has been interpreted as a test of the woman’s faith. Others see it as a boundary-breaking encounter in which, through the woman’s agency, Jesus comes to broaden his thinking and reorient his mission to include Gentiles. Join us as Maria Pascuzzi, CSJ, invites us to consider the difficulty of relinquishing privileged status and power, a difficulty that persists in our own day.
