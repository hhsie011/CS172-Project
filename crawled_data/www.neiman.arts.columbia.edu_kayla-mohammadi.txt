Using the same image - an abstracted pier - in each of her three screenprints, Mohammadi changes their color variations to create wholly distinct images. The use of color, as she has noted, plays a central role in her abstract painting practice: “Although I draw from the landscape and still life as a way to explore ideas, my main interest is in abstract painting. Through drawing and collage I work towards a simple expression of what I am seeing and feeling. Abstracting space through color and mark is what keeps me engaged with painting.” Born in San Francisco, CA, Mohammadi received a BFA from University of Washington in 1998 and a MFA from Boston University in 2002. Her work was the subject of a solo exhibition at Caldbeck Gallery in Rockland, Maine and a two-person exhibition with John Walker at Maier Museum of Art at Randolph College in Lynchburg, VA, among others. She has been awarded the American Academy of Arts and Letters Purchase Prize in 2014; the Joan Mitchell Foundation Award for Painters in 2008 and the Joan Mitchell Artist Residency in New Orleans; the Dedalus Foundation Award for the Vermont Studio School Fellowship in 2008; the Ludwig Vogelstein Foundation Grant in 2006; the Blanche E. Colman Award in 2004; the Constantin Alajalov Scholarship; and the Vermont Studio School Fellowship in 2001. She is currently a Fine Arts Lecturer at Massachusetts College of Art in Boston and lives and works in Boston and South Bristol, Maine.
