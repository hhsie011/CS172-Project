The first was its focus on technology, and the second was the diversity of the students in the classroom. Mary Arfeli Product Development Merchant, Lowe's Companies, Inc. Status:Alumni Program:Executive MBA I really found the women in our cohort to be insightful. We bounce ideas off of each other not only on the professional side, but also the family side. We get ideas from each other on how to do certain things related to managing family throughout the program. We also help each other understand where we need to go next in the program and our careers and help pull each other in the directions we want to go. Duane Carthy Vice President, Relationship Management, Morgan Stanley Status:Alumni Program:Executive MBA I looked at a number of different programs, and Georgia Tech, by far, stood out. Anthony Diaz Senior Director, Strategy & Operations, Coca-Cola Status:Alumni Program:Executive MBA Pursuing an Executive MBA from Georgia Tech was the seminal moment in my personal and professional growth. The experience was far more than just the pursuit of a degree. It has expanded my strategic mindset beyond what I thought was possible. Garry Fielding Private Equity Executive, Francisco Partners Consulting Status:Alumni Program:Executive MBA Getting my MBA at Scheller gave me deeper insights into the relationship between technology and business. I made lasting connections with fellow leaders from multiple backgrounds and industries who continue to be instrumental in my personal and professional development. Dan Frye Cofounder & CEO, Rocketansky Status:Alumni Program:Executive MBA Tom, Paul, and I met in the EMBA program. For us, the EMBA program was much more than just a degree – it was the genesis story for our startup. Wendy Niebank SVP, Global Portfolio Management, People 2.0 Status:Alumni Program:Executive MBA In addition to giving to Scheller, I serve as a Georgia Tech Ambassador. I also give to my undergrad alma mater. I believe you should refill the well so that someone else can have a meaningful experience. Take what you need, but you have to put it back for the next person/generation. Denise Smith Senior Director, Product Management - Enterprise Technology Corporate Solutions, Cox Automotive Inc. Status:Alumni Program:Executive MBA I was at a point in my career where I wanted to pivot from senior project management to executive management with profit and loss responsibilities. I knew I needed to invest in learning more than reading a $8.99 accounting for dummies book. My executive MBA classroom experience provided me with “day in the life of” management at the executive level. My cohort was a mix of folks with management roles, early and late-stage entrepreneurs, and C-suite executives for Fortune 100 and 500 companies. The level of exposure to every level of perspective was nothing short of incredible. Our classroom discussions revealed elements of collaboration needed to solve a particular business challenge. This experience was something I would have never been able to obtain anywhere else. Without a doubt, obtaining my Executive MBA ignited my career path to where I am today. Julianne Tajuba Commercial Solution Engineering Leader, mParticle Status:Alumni Program:Executive MBA It's nice to be in a classroom with someone that's a COO of a local company or someone that's director of IT. They have real-world experiences. And so, in class, when we'd have discussions, it wasn't theoretical. It was direct application. You could have a conversation with your classmate over coffee, and literally on Monday, go take that to work. Nikkela Tucker Director, Strategic Payer Partnerships, Walmart Status:Alumni Program:Executive MBA The knowledgeable, engaging, and easily accessible professors and administrative staff make Scheller a wonderful place to learn.
