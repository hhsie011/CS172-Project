Though there should be a limited need to exchange sensitive or confidential information electronically, when members of the Penn community are required to do so, Secure Share provides an easy-to-use mechanism that ensures the safety and privacy of University data. Access To access the application, log in https://secureshare.apps.upenn.edu and authenticate with your PennKey and password. After you authenticate, you will be redirected to the Secure Share application. Note: If you do not have a PennKey, or if you have a PennKey but forgot your password, visit http://www.upenn.edu/computing/pennkey/ for more information. If you have any trouble with the PennKey process, contact your Local Support Provider. For a contact list, visit http://www.upenn.edu/computing/view/support/. How does Secure Share work? When users upload, download, and store files via Secure Share, those files become encrypted. As well, Secure Share ensures those files reach only the intended recipient(s), sending e-mail notifications when the files are available for retrieval. Files are automatically deleted after they are retrieved, but files that aren't retrieved within 30 days are deleted from the system. Secure Share should not be used as a document storage mechanism, but rather a safe alternative to file-exchange methods. Other benefits of Secure Share Reduces University exposure to data compromise issues e.g. identity theft Protects confidential data in documents, such as Social Security Numbers, financial information, health information, student grades, etc. Eliminates the need for individual departments or Schools to develop in-house, secure file exchange systems Questions?
