Housing Commitment Princeton makes every effort to make an offer of University housing to all incoming graduate students whose applications for University housing meet the announced deadline. After all eligible first-year students have been housed, priority decreases with year of study. Most students can expect to be housed for three years. Enrolled students who need to remain in University housing for special personal or financial reasons may receive priority over other returning students if they apply for hardship housing. Information can be found in the housing room draw guide. Additional information is given in the on the Graduate Housing and Cost of Living website.
