Home Home Students Parents Faculty & Staff Alumni College of Engineering Chemical Engineering 105 Benson Hall 206-543-2250 Website Faculty Website The chemical engineering profession is a close-knit group with a common background in chemical processes, systems analysis, and systems economics. Chemical engineering training occurs through course and laboratory work addressing mathematical, scientific, and engineering fundamentals. Chemical engineers study, design and operate processes to provide food, water, energy, clothing, medicine and materials. These processes transform raw materials from the environment into desired products. They also return spent products and by-products to the environment in an ecologically sustainable manner.

Chemical engineers find industrial employment in areas of energy, the environment, biomedicine, electronics, food production, and materials. Chemical engineers also find careers in academia and government and military service. Students study chemical processes at the molecular level and the chemical plant level and gain an engineering education deeply grounded in mathematics, chemistry, physics, biology, and materials science. This program of study leads to the following credentials: Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering degree Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering degree: Nanoscience and Molecular Engineering Admission Requirements Engineering Undeclared Students See section on College of Engineering Admission for additional details on Direct-to-College admission and placement process for Engineering Undeclared students. The deadline to submit a request for placement in an engineering major occurs annually on July 1. If the number of Engineering Undeclared students requesting the major exceeds the department capacity for such students, a matching process is implemented. Factors considered include performance in prerequisite courses, quality of overall academic record, content of personal statement, applicable work or extracurricular activities, and other special circumstances as disclosed by the applicant. Core courses within the department form a seven-quarter curriculum designed to start spring quarter of the sophomore year. Because the curriculum is cohort-based and all students start and proceed at the same pace, Engineering Undeclared students admitted to Chemical Engineering after their first year are expected to start the curriculum in spring quarter of their second year. Engineering Undeclared students in good standing with respect to the continuation criteria described below may request placement into an engineering major after completion of minimum requirements as specified below: ENGR 101 English composition MATH 124, MATH 125, MATH 126 (or MATH 134, MATH 135, MATH 136) CHEM 142 (or CHEM 143 or CHEM 145) PHYS 121 (or PHYS 141) One course from the list on this website. Students are encouraged to choose a course required for graduation in the majors they are considering. Students requesting placement in Chemical Engineering must take CHEM 152 (or CHEM 153 or CHEM 155) from this list and they are also strongly recommended to complete CHEM 162 (or CHEM 165) prior to requesting placement. Minimum 2.0 grade in all courses used to satisfy placement requirements Minimum 2.50 cumulative GPA in courses used to satisfy placement requirements Minimum 12 credits as a matriculated UW student. Some departments require more credits. See department websites for details. Chemical Engineering is the only engineering major that requires students to complete CHEM 152 (or CHEM 153 or CHEM 155) to request placement because that course is required in order to complete the major in four years. Students in good standing who do not meet the placement requirements by July 1 will be placed into a major on a conditional basis pending the completion of all placement requirements and readiness to begin the chemical engineering core course sequence in the following spring quarter. Additional advising resources will be available to these students. See section on College of Engineering Continuation Policy for Engineering Undeclared Students for additional details. Current UW Students and Transfer Students The department follows a cohort model beginning in spring quarter. Transfer students, current UW students without Engineering Undeclared status, and current UW students with Engineering Undeclared status who are eligible to begin the chemical engineering core sequence of courses in their first spring quarter may apply. Admission is competitive. Admission is for spring quarter only. Application deadline: January 15 Minimum course requirements: MATH 124, MATH 125, MATH 126, MATH 207 (or MATH 134, MATH 135, MATH 136; AMATH 351 may substitute for MATH 207); CHEM 142, CHEM 152, CHEM 162 (or CHEM 143, CHEM 153; or CHEM 145, CHEM 155, CHEM 165); PHYS 121, PHYS 122 (or PHYS 141, PHYS 142); 5 credits of English composition. Two required courses may be in progress during winter quarter. CHEM 237 (or CHEM 223 or CHEM 335) strongly recommended. Grade requirements: Minimum 2.0 grade for each course required for application; minimum 2.50 cumulative GPA in courses required for application Factors evaluated for admission include performance in prerequisite courses, quality of overall academic record, demonstrated ability to handle rigorous course load, record of honors, content of personal statement, applicable work or extracurricular activities, and other special circumstances as disclosed by the applicant. General Expectations of Academic Progress: Completion of all admission requirements listed for "Current UW Students and Transfer Students" as well as the following courses by the start of autumn quarter of the junior year: organic chemistry I and II (CHEM 237 and CHEM 238; or CHEM 223, CHEM 224; or CHEM 335 and CHEM 336), PHYS 123 (or PHYS 143), AMATH 301 (or CSE 142), MATH 208 (unless MATH 136 or AMATH 352 is taken), CHEM 310. Continuation Policy All students must make satisfactory academic progress in the major. Failure to do so results in probation, which can lead to dismissal from the major. For the complete continuation policy, contact the departmental adviser or refer to the department website. Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering degree Credential Overview The Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering (B.S.Ch.E.) is a highly marketable, professional degree that prepares undergraduate students for employment in industry or graduate study. With a strong background in mathematics, chemistry, and physics, chemical engineering students study transport phenomena (the description of momentum, heat, and mass transfer in chemical processes); chemical kinetics and reaction engineering; process control and design; and optimization of chemical processes and apply this knowledge to engineering solutions in a wide variety of areas.

Instructional and Research Facilities: The chemical engineering building, Benson Hall, contains classrooms, offices, stockrooms, computer rooms, machine and electronics shops, and laboratories. The Unit Operations Laboratory holds a variety of experiments designed to give undergraduate students the experience of using real chemical process equipment and to deepen their understanding of chemical engineering fundamentals of fluid flow, heat transfer, separation processes, and reactor behavior. Departmental computer facilities include a network of PCs located in a keyed room for the exclusive use of chemical engineering students. Ten of these machines have hardware for computer data acquisition (to collect experimental data and support experiments on process automation). All have fast connections to the Internet and to larger UW computers. Honors Options Available: With College Honors (Completion of Honors Core Curriculum and Departmental Honors); With Honors (Completion of Departmental Honors requirements in the major). See adviser for requirements. Research, Internships, and Service Learning: Students are encouraged to participate in internships, which are generally facilitated through the Engineering Co-op Office. Department Scholarships: The department awards 20-25 full-tuition scholarships per year. See departmental website for application procedures. Student Organizations/Associations: The undergraduates in the department run a dynamic chapter of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers. Of Special Note: Entrance into most chemical engineering courses is ordinarily limited to majors in chemical engineering and bioresource science and engineering. Other students who wish to take departmental courses must meet the prerequisites and obtain instructor approval (except for CHEM E 485 and CHEM E 486, which are open to majors only).
