As our Preferred Hotels, they offer value-added amenity packages to guests booked through Princeton University. Contracted rates and amenities can be found in our Concur travel booking tool or can be secured by booking through the University's travel agency, World Travel. These rates are for University business only. Click on the buttons below for additional information on any of the 2019 Princeton University Preferred Hotels. Preferred Hotels The travel program recently released a hotel matrix that summarizes negotiated rates and availability of hotel amenities at all of the University's preferred Princeton-area properties. The document will allow University affiliates to compare local hotel rates and see which amenities are available to guests at the present time -- such as shuttle service, restaurants, and fitness centers. Due to the pandemic, not all amenities have been available to guests and the matrix will provide information on their current state for travel arrangers. Access information at Preferred Hotels Matrix. Palmer House Palmer House is located on Nassau Street only two blocks from the front gates of campus. It is a historic Bed and Breakfast affiliated with Princeton University offering elegant accommodations exclusively for University-sponsored guests.
