Accreditation information in the University Catalog can be found here: https://catalog.memphis.edu/preview_entity.php?catoid=22&ent_oid=1352&returnto=1124. Program Educational Objectives The program educational objectives are that within a few years, graduates will have: Secured employment in Computer Engineering or related fields; Advanced their careers as measured by promotions, salaries, career satisfaction, positions of leadership, awards, recognitions, entrepreneurial activities, development of products or process, patents, and/or publications; Continued to learn new knowledge and to acquire new expertise as measured by post-graduate education, continuing education, and/or professional registration; Contributed to society and the profession as measured by professional service, community service, and/or public service. In pursuit of these objectives, students enrolled in Computer Engineering are offered a curriculum designed to provide a thorough background and understanding of the theoretical and physical principles of computer hardware and software. The intent of the program is to produce graduates who can apply concepts and techniques of mathematics and physics to a variety of analysis and design applications in Computer Engineering. In addition, graduates are prepared to communicate their ideas succinctly and clearly in both oral and written presentations Constituencies: Students, Alumni, Faculty, and Employers Revision Frequency: 4 years Next Revision Cycle: Fall 2025 Student Outcomes Graduates of Computer Engineering will have demonstrated: An ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics An ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences An ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts An ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives An ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions An ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies.
