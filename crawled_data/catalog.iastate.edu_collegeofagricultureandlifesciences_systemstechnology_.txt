Students majoring in AST choose between two options: Agricultural and Biosystems Management or Machine Systems. The department also offers a minor in Agricultural Systems Technology. Successful AST graduates gain knowledge, skills, and abilities in solving technical problems, understanding the design process, excelling in authentic leadership, being aware of safety issues, having a quality orientation, effectively managing projects, and having a systems-thinking perspective. This translates to a holistic approach where AST graduates apply science, technology and engineering principles to manage complex agricultural and other production systems, including how the constituent sub-systems are interrelated and the broader impact of these systems. Graduates find careers within a variety of agricultural industries, businesses, and organizations in the fields of agricultural machinery; off-road equipment; food, feed and grain processing; water quality; biorenewable resources; precision agriculture; or livestock production systems. Common job duties of AST Agricultural and Biosystems Management graduates include: technical support operations management production supervision grain elevator management Common job duties of AST Machine Systems graduates include: precision agriculture support testing or sales management technical support maintenance supervision Student Learning Outcomes Upon graduation, all AST students should be able to: Apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and applied engineering to identify and solve applied science and technology problems Develop and conduct experiments, and analyze and interpret resulting data Evaluate and adapt systems, components, processes to meet specified needs Function effectively on multi-disciplinary teams Communicate effectively, ethically, and professionally in written, oral, and other formats to technical and non-technical audiences Understand the potential impacts and limitations of solutions in global and societal contexts Recognize the need for, and demonstrate an ability to, engage in life-long learning Effectively apply modern scientific and technical tools necessary for professional practice to address contemporary issues in applied engineering and technology Upon graduation, AST students in the agricultural and biosystems management (ABM) option should be able to: Design, implement, and evaluate best practices for the management of global and natural resource systems Integrate and utilize agricultural and biosystems applied engineering and technology to address contemporary issues in bio-based industries Evaluate the factors impacting the complex systems that sustain water, air, soils, food, and feed Upon graduation, AST students in the machine systems (MS) option should be able to: Specify, manage, and test machine systems in the context of a complete agricultural, biological production or processing system Use and apply the technology of machine systems including power and information flows, function and interaction with biological materials Perform an energy and cost analyses of complete machine systems to ensure the success and sustainability of an enterprise For more information about the AST degree: http://www.abe.iastate.edu/undergraduate-students/agricultural-systems-technology Total Degree Requirement: 120 cr.
