According to the World Economic Forum, 65% of children now entering primary school will hold jobs that don't currently exist. Automation and technological disruption are drastically changing the employment landscape. Now, more than ever, it is crucial to equip future generations with the skills needed to keep up with the rapid changes. Workforce readiness is a top priority for Georgia Tech Professional Education (GTPE). From summer camps to teacher programs and distance math classes, we offer programs specifically engineered to give students the tools to solve real-world problems while also building their critical thinking skills. By providing opportunities to K12 students in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects, we are investing in our future workforce. Distance Math Program The Georgia Tech Dual Enrollment program provides high school students the opportunity to take advanced math courses online. Classes are taught on-campus to Georgia Tech students while being delivered via live video or internet feed to partner high schools across Georgia.
