While only approximate, the data may help you select the study space that's right for you. The WiFi Density Application was developed by ADI Labs in conjunction with Columbia Engineering Student Council. Density estimates how full study spaces are on campus using a live feed of Wi-Fi access data that updates every 15 minutes. Data is anonymized as device counts over a 15 minute period and is provided by CUIT.
