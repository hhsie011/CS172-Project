From choosing to pursue a professional track, study abroad, honors, or the engaged scholars program, options abound to make the Brown engineering experience your own. Engaged Scholars The Engaged Scholars Program allows students to apply their engineering knowledge toward addressing societal issues in partnership with external organizations. Honors Based on their academic performance up to the end of the junior year, students may apply for admission to the Honors Program. Independent Study Independent Study courses are created by students who work with a faculty member to explore a topic of mutual interest. Professional Tracks Students must complete two full-time professional experiences, lasting two to four months each (or two part-time experiences of equivalent total effort), doing work that is related to their concentration program. Study Abroad The global nature of the engineering profession makes a study abroad program particularly attractive.
