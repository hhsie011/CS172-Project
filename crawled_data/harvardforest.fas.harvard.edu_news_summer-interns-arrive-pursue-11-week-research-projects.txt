Thus began their 11-week Summer Research Program internships, during which they will pursue mentored team projects on topics ranging from amplifying Indigenous voices in STEM to understanding controls on forest carbon sequestration. The program, now in its fourth decade, is co-directed by Audrey Barker Plotkin and Sydne Record. This summer, Program Assistants Nautica Jones and Savannah Brown -- both recent alumni of the program -- will coordinate the program's many daily aspects as well as its evening and weekend research seminars, field trips, grad school and career panels, and workshops in data analysis and science communication.
