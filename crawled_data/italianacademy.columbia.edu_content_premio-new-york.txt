Watch a TV interview with the 2014–15 artists. Premio New York Artists Sven Sachsalber 2013-2014 Sven Sachsalber's autobiographic work mostly takes the shape of photos or videos, in which the performative and the sculptural play a key element. Often funny, often serious and sometimes both, his works have a universal poetic element that does not need much explanation Sven Sachsalber (born 1987 in Silandro) studied sculpture at the Royal College of Art from 2010 to 2012. Since 2009 he has lived in London. Sachsalber is Co-Founder of Winterprojects in London together with Mathis Gasser. His work was recently shown at Galerie Rianne Groen, Rotterdam; Dienstgebäude, Zürich and Limoncello Gallery, London. In 2014, Sachsalber will present a solo exhibition at the Museion Project Room, Bolzano. Sissi (Daniela Olivieri) 2005-2006: Fall Sissi was born in 1977 in Bologna.

In 2004, her solo show Nidi was exhibited at the the Museo d'Arte Contemporanea in Rome. Central to Sissi's work are manual ability and the body; sculptural elements, including wool, rattan, scoubidu, are fundamental to her performances and become environments for her body, like a butterfly's cocoon. Silvia Vendramel 2007-2008: Spring Silvia Vendramel’s work has been exhibited in solo and group shows in Italy, Spain, France, and Germany. Sarah Ciraci 2003-2004 Born in Grottaglie (Taranto) in 1972, Ciraci lives and works in Milan. She took part in the experience of Via Fiuggi, a program in which a group of young artists with a common background live and work together for a number of years. Many contemporary Italian artists come from Via Fiuggi. Ciraci presented her work entitled “Dimensional Jump” in April 2004 at the Italian Academy.

Sara Enrico 2017-2018 Spring Sara Enrico’s work examines the concept of “weaving” in the material and figurative planes, and as a conceptual process, such as the weaving together of several languages. Using manual and digital processes and the basic materials of painting with industrial and textile materials, she investigates the potentialities of a surface in relation with its own body and context. Shapes that seem to assume postures and certain anthropomorphic traits, as in à terre, en l’air (Tile project space, Milan, 2017), Ghost tracks (Fondazione 107, Turin, 2015) and No music was playing (Les Instants Chavirés, Montreuil, Paris, 2014), or in the new body of works, The Jumpsuit Theme, recently became part of the permanent collection of PAV Parco Arte Vivente, Torino (2017). Her work has been shown in solo and group exhibitions including: Deposito d’Arte Italiana Presente, Artissima, Turin 2017; An Entertainment in Conversation and Verse, Galleria Tiziana di Caro, Naples 2017; Biennale Internazionale Arte in Memoria, Sinagoga, Parco Archeologico di Ostia Antica, Ostia (Rome) 2017; Mirroring, Fonderia Artistica Battaglia, Milan, 2016; 60° Premio Termoli, In Cantiere, MACTE Termoli, 2016; Supernova, MAG, Riva del Garda, 2015; Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, Turin, 2014; Galleria d'arte moderna e contemporanea, Turin, 2013; Peep Hole, Milan, 2013. Enrico (born in Biella, 1979; lives in Turin) studied at Accademia di Belle Arti in Turin and in Florence at the Istituto Spinelli for a specialization in restoration of ancient paintings and frescoes. In 2013, she attended the Advanced Course in Visual Arts with Matt Mullican at the Fondazione Antonio Ratti in Como. She has had residencies at Fondazione Spinola Banna per l’arte in Poirino with Jason Dodge and Raimundas Malasauskas (2015), and, earlier, at VIR-viafarini in residence in Milan (2012). In 2017 she was visiting professor for Polito Design Workshop at the Politecnico di Torino. Enrico is the co-founder of Laboratorio del Dubbio, a cross-disciplinary project composed in 2016 as short-term residency for artists, researchers and writers in Turin. She was a member of Progetto Diogene, a group based in Turin where she ran an international grant program, talks, and workshops on the idea of self-education (from 2008 to 2012). Salvatore Arancio 2009-2010: Fall Salvatore Arancio’s main interest lies in the potential of images. Departing from their literal meaning, he creates new juxtapositions that are both beautifully evocative and deeply disquieting. Working across a range of media such as photo-etchings, collage, animation and video, he looks to nature and science for his sources of inspiration, while unsettling any hint of the sublime by re-framing the images and the viewer’s experience. His constructed landscapes contain a sense of both the familiar and the unknown that enhances their symbolic readings and implications. His work has been featured in numerous exhibitions including “I giovani che visitano le nostre rovine non vi vedono che uno stile,” at GAM, Turin, (2009), Prague Biennale 4, Karlin Hall, Prague (2009), Nul, Foxy Production, New York (2008) No Room For the Groom: An Exhibition with Douglas Sirk, Herald St, London (2007) among others. During his stay in New York Arancio will focus his research on the study of the archives related to the New York World's Fair of 1939 and its machine-age Utopian visions, combining them with the rigorous aesthetic of Berenice Abbott' s scientific “Super Sight” photographs which are part of the Photography Collection of The New York Public Library's Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Division of Art, Prints and Photographs. Ruth Beraha 2022: Spring Painting, Drawing & Video, Sculpture Ruth Beraha (Milan, 1986). Beraha’s research investigates elements that can commonly be labeled, evil, strange, or unknown, focusing on the disruption of the certainties on which we base our experience of the world. With immersive audios, sculptures, installations, drawings and photographs, her work makes the viewer consider the Adversary no longer as a distant and incomprehensible entity, but as a constitutive part of our identity. Her most recent shows include: My Blueberry Night II, curated by Antonio Grulli, Piazza del Duomo, Bergamo (2019); Dad Jokes, Ncontemporary gallery, Milan (2019); Non sarai mai solo, solo show curated by Paola Tognon, Museo della Città, Livorno (2019); MONO 2, solo show curated by Gabriele Tosi and Fabio Farnè, LocaleDue, Bologna (2018); Arte in memoria 10, Biennial of Contemporary Art, Ostia Antica archeological site, Rome (2018); That’s it, curated by Lorenzo Balbi, MAMbo, Bologna (2018); Pensiero stupendo (self-portrait), solo show curated by Stefano Coletto, Museo Ca’ Rezzonico, Venice (2018); Take Me (I’m Yours), curated by Christian Boltanski, Hans Ulrich Obrist, Chiara Parisi, Roberta Tenconi, Pirelli HangarBicocca, Milan (2017). www.ruthberaha.it Rossella Biscotti 2006-2007: Spring Rossella Biscotti uses the documentary aesthetic to explore the relationship between historical, real and fictional time through video and installation. Her videos have been exhibited in galleries and museums throughout Italy and Europe including TENT (Rotterdam), American Academy in Rome (Rome), Galeria Paolo Boselli (Brussels), GAM Castel San Pietro Terme (Bologna), Viafarini (Milan), Smart Project Space (Amsterdam), Prodajna Galerija (Belgrade), Trevi Flash Art Museum (Trevi), Fondazione Olivetti (Rome). Ra Di Martino 2004-2005: Film & Video Rä di Martino was born in Rome in 1975 and has been living and working in London since 1997 where she graduated with an MFA from the Slade School of Art. In October 2003 she opened her first solo exhibition at Monitor Gallery in Rome. Rä has also participated and exhibited works at various group exhibitions in Bologna, Prague, Chicago, London, Berlin, and Barcelona. Her 2002 film 'NOT360' was winner of the 2nd video art award of the Museum of Contemporary Art of Trento and Galleria Civica di Rovereto, and her 2001 film 'between' was shortlisted and exhibited at the 2002 Beck's Student Film Award at the ICA (Institute of Contemporary Art) in London. Pietro Ruffo 2010-2011 Pietro Ruffo was born in 1978 in Rome and later studied architecture there. His paintings, drawings and sculptural installations reflect his intense social and moral concerns. His work uses large "maps" tracing the cultural and military influence of the world's imperial powers. Technical drawing and geographical maps are elaborated further through freehand drawing; his installations embrace both highly technical materials and an intensely manual practice. The themes of colonialism and the desire for liberty led him to develop a project over the past year that addresses Isaiah Berlin, the Oxford University professor considered one of the 20th century's strongest exponents of liberalism. Ruffo's current project is titled "The rise of liberal thought in the U.S.A." He has exhibited at M.A.D. (the Museum of Arts and Design) in New York; TEA (Tenerife Espacio de las Artes); Kunstverein Langenhagen, Germany; MAXXI (the National Museum of XXI Century Arts), Rome; MACRO (Museo d'Arte Contemporanea, Roma); MAR (Museo d'Arte della città di Ravenna); and the Centro Arti Visive Pescheria, Pesaro, Italy. In 2005 he travelled to Beslan, Russia, to work with children who survived the massacre at their local school by Chechen rebels. Ruffo has also worked on other public projects, including a sculptural proposal for Ground Zero, a special project in the psychiatric hospital in Colmar, France, and various art workshops with disadvantaged children. Patrick Tuttofuoco Paolo Chiasera 2006-2007: Fall Paolo Chiasera was born in 1978, in Bologna, Italy.

Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst, Ghent (Belgium), MARTa, Herford (Germany), Museo Nacional Reina Sofia, Madrid, Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, Turin, and GAM Galleria Civica D'Arte Moderna e Contemporanea, Turin. His works were also included in the first Moscow Biennal and in the first T1-Torino Triennale Tremusei. He has been affiliated with the Massimo Minini gallery in Brescia since 2003. Nico Vascellari 2006-2007: Spring Nico Vascellari was born in Vittorio Veneto in 1976. He left the university to focus on his singing for With Love, a punk/noise band with which he has produced several albums and toured throughout Europe, USA and Japan. The intensity of performance is one of the starting points of Vascellari's artistic research. His work includes the use of media such as sculpture, photography, video and installation. His performances were recently defined as “storms of feedback between the performer, the audience and the space”. (Andrea Lissoni on “Tema Celeste”). Vascellari was awarded the First International Prize for Performance for his project “Nico & The Vascellari” by a committee headed by Marina Abramovic, who invited him to join her group, IPG.

In 2006 she worked in Maastricht within the program MapXXL- Pèpinières Européennes pour jeunes artistes, where she realized, in collaboration with a psychiatric hospital, Travel Tales, a radio-play reconstructing the memories of a patient affected of Dromomania. She was artist-in-residence at Le Pavillon-Laboratoire de création du Palais de Tokyo, Paris for the edition 2007/2008 and short-listed for the prize The Spirit in any condition does not burn – 7. Premio Furla 2009 Matteo Basile 2002-2003: Spring Among the pioneers of digital art, Matteo Basilé is an artist who uses avant-garde technology as an art of analysis in the process of self and social discovery. Basile currently lives and works in Rome, Italy. Marta Dell'Angelo 2002-2003: Spring Marta Dell'Angelo was born in 1970 in Pavia, Italy. In July 2000 her first personal exhibition was held at la Tartaruga di Plinio De Martiis Gallery. In 2002, she won (along with Sara Rossi, Matteo Basilè and Chiara) the first edition of Premio New York; in the same year she showed at Assab One, curated by Roberto Pinto and Laura Garbarino in Milano, at Solitudes at Michel Rein Gallery in Paris and at Le Case d'Arte di Pasquale Leccese Gallery in Milano, where she presented her work Classe III H. Marinella Senatore 2010-2011 Marinella Senatore is a film director and director of photography who also works with drawing, painting and installation. She holds a degree from Rome's Centre for Experimental Cinematography and teaches video and photography at the University of Castilla-La Mancha and the University Complutense of Madrid. Her films, photographs and installations demonstrate her interest in the arrangement of light on the set. This interest has also inspired sculptural installations (Memeland, 2005) and photographic series (Places, 2005). In recent years, Senatore has been working with storytelling as a means to involve the public in the making of artworks. In such projects, which take the form of collaborative films (such as How do U kill the Chemist,2009; Manuale per Viaggiatori, 2007; Horizontes de Sucesos, 2007; and All the things I need, 2006) she uses music as a place of exchange, where the viewer becomes participant, and the hierarchy between the artist as author and the public as recipient can be questioned and rewritten. In other pieces the public has been involved as producer of public projects, though a microcredit system that aims at creating an alternative and socially responsible economy for cultural production. The artist takes the role of facilitator, or mediator. Along the way, this collective dimension has gradually expanded to involve students, women's communities, business associations and groups of craftspeople in stage design, set building and technical aspects, touching the very core of production. With a contribution of one or two Euros each, her most recent videos were entirely produced by thousands of people (1,200 citizens of Madrid produced the musical Speak Easy in 2009), in a choral enthusiasm founded on effective micro-relationality. Her work fosters the construction of an archive of shared narratives that create a sense of community. Her subjects and plots are narrative occasions for complex audiovisual machines where light plays its demiurgic role, music acts as emotional catalyst, and photography carries out its governing function between the poles of reality and fiction, between the truth of the streets and the phantasmagoria of invention. Margherita Moscardini 2014-2015: Spring Margherita Moscardini (born in Italy, 1981) investigates relationships among transformation processes in the urban, social and natural order. She often focuses on abandoned locations and areas undergoing demolition, whereby the demolitions’ waste systems become a paradigm of local complexities. Her work generally focuses on long-term projects in which the context itself becomes the medium. Moscardini obtained a bachelor’s degree in Cultural Anthropology at the Academy of Fine Arts in Bologna, and attended the Advanced Course in Visual Arts with Yona Friedman at the Fondazione Antonio Ratti in Como.In the last few years she has developed projects in South Korea, Turkey, Bulgaria, France, and Italy.

Ludovica Carbotta 2017-2018: Spring Ludovica Carbotta (Torino, 1982) lives and works in Maastricht (NL). Her practice focuses on the physical exploration of the urban space and how individuals establish connections with the environment they inhabit. In recent works, she has combined installation, texts, and performance to research fictional site-specificity, a form of site-oriented practice that considers imaginary places—or embodies real places with fictional contexts—recovering the role of imagination as a value to construct our knowledge. Carbotta completed her MFA at Goldsmiths University in London (2015). Her work has been exhibited in numerous institutions including Kunstlerhaus Museum (Graz), MAXXI Museum (Rome), Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo (Turin), Hangar Bicocca (Milan), Dublin Contemporary (Dublin), Matadero (Madrid), Swiss Institute (Rome), and Les Instants Chavirés (Paris).

Francesca Grilli 2015-2016 Spring Francesca Grilli was born in Bologna in 1978. Her work examines the realm of sound processing, in all its forms, registers and multiple implications, expressive and perceptive. Using the language of performance, she moves between private and personal elements and the spectators' space of action, drawing viewers into a boundless space of physical and emotional involvement, often an ambiguous and unsettling territory. Her poetics, respectively articulated through video and performance, focus attention on the complexity of an intimate story and seek an action of maximum intensity, supported by the element of sound, which she considers the most effective means of communicating directly with the personal and collective unconscious. In recent years, she has worked extensively on language—its metaphors and evocations—particularly in The Conversation (performance, 2010). The search for a completely dematerialized degree of communication, straddling magic and ritual, is the backbone of many of her works, including Moth (2009). Fatma Bucak 2018-2019: Spring 1984. Lives and works between London and Istanbul. Born in Turkey, Fatma Bucak studied Philosophy at Istanbul University and History of Art and Etching in Italy at the Albertina Academy of Fine Arts, before completing her MA in Photography at the Royal College of Art, London. Bucak's practices in performance, photography, sound, and video center on political identity, cultural and gender norms, and landscape as a space of historical renegotiation. Investigating the fragility, tension and irreversibility of history, the power of testimony and memory in her practice she often questions traditional forms of history-making.

Portrait Credit: © N.Gokhan Yorganci Eva Mattes 2006-2007: Fall Eva and Franco Mattes, a.k.a. 0100101110101101.ORG, are a couple of restless Italian artists who use non-conventional communication tactics to obtain the largest visibility with the minimum effort. Born in 1976, they live between Barcelona, New York and Bologna, and work throughout the world. They have been pioneers in the net.art movement; remixing famous digital art pieces and performing Life Sharing: a real-time digital self portrait, during which they even submitted to satellite surveillance for an entire year. In the last decade they have focused on creating unpredictable mass-scale performances staged outside art spaces, involving an unaware audience, where truth and falsehood mix to the point of being indistinguishable. Among other wonderfully twisted things, they've erected fake architectural heritage signs, run media campaigns for non-existent action movies, and even convinced the entire populace of Vienna that Nike had purchased the city's historic Karlsplatz and was about to rename it “Nikeplatz.” Their controversial performances, which have often bordered on illegality, have been discussed in countless television shows, art magazines and newspapers, earning them the name the “Bonnie and Clyde of Contemporary Art.” Their works have been shown internationally at numerous institutions including: Collection Lambert, Avignon; Fondazione Pitti Discovery, Florence, Postmasters Gallery, New York; Lentos Museum of Modern Art, Linz; New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York; ICC, Tokyo; Manifesta 4, Frankfurt. In 2006 they won the Premio New York. In 2000 they received the Jerome Commission from the Walker Art Center. They are among the youngest artists ever to participate in the Venice Biennale. The Mattes' works are part of several private and public collections such as the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; MEIAC, Spain; MAK, Vienna. They are artistic directors of the international cult-status festival “The Influencers.” Ettore Favini 2007-2008: Fall Born in Cremona, Italy, in 1974, Favini received his BFA at the Brera Academy of Fine Arts, where he studied with Alberto Garutti. The book which most exemplifies his artistic concerns is “The Third Landscape” by Gilles Clement, landscape architect and gardener. Favini has exhibited at Fuori Uso, Mercato Globale (Montesilvano 1997, Former Stellamare Colony), La Ville, la Memoire le Jardin (Rome 1998, Villa Medici), Rough End (Milan 2005, Alessandro de March Gallery), Il mio Papà (Rome 2006, Adriano Olivetti Foundation), and Ettore Favini (Milan, Alessandro de March Gallery). Danilo Correale 2016-2017: Spring Danilo Correale’s work analyzes aspects of human life, such as labor-leisure and sleep, through the lenses of time and the body.

Born in Naples in 1982, Correale lives and works in New York and Naples. Chiara Fumai 2016-2017: Spring Chiara Fumai’s project examined the metaphysical representation of evil, inspired by the writings of psychoanalyst and Christian occultist Dion Fortune. Although unable to complete her residency, she began an artwork that used cosmic debris as a metaphor, in which the debris would speak, using words from “The Gospel of Diana,” an apocryphal late nineteenth-century publication about the revolt and superiority of nature over humanity. Chiara Carocci 2002-2003: Fall Chiara Carocci, known in the art world as “Chiara,” is an Italian artist who works with photography and digital imaging.

Alice Cattaneo 2009-2010: Fall Alice Cattaneo’s spatial interventions carry an idea of vulnerability through meticulous gestures that play out in a dimension between stasis and chaos. As in these unbalanced architectures in her videos, her actions put in motion chains of micro-moments that simultaneously defy gravity and explore areas of structural instability. The images she creates are, in their bare simplicity, fragments that explore complexity through specific actions. Both in the video and in the architectural interventions the logic is that of the stage machine. In the theatre, the machine should vanish behind the stage, but here it shows itself openly. Cattaneo studied at the Glasgow School of Art and at the San Francisco Art Institute. Recent solo exhibitions include: Galleria Suzy Shammah, Milan (2008); MADRE Museum, Naples (2008); Ikon Gallery, Birmingham (2007); and Analix Forever, Geneva (2006).

During the residency in New York, Cattaneo’s research will investigate two different experiences of urban reality: The Arcades Project by Walter Benjamin, a philosophical vision of the 19th Century in Paris, and the Russian Utopia Museum, a virtual archive containing 480 unbuilt architectural prospects. Identifying New York as a polymorphic context where it is possible to relocate connections between experienced and imagined situations, she will focus on the idea of the fragment and the urban landscape as visions of an imaginary space suspended between reality and the theater. Alessandra Tesi 2003-2004 Film & Video An artist from Bologna, Tesi presented a screening of her film entitled “The Glass Movie/Film di vetro” at the Italian Academy. Tesi's objective in creating “The Glass Movie” was to create a film of infinite length, adding scenes over time, a succession of paintings made of light.
