Retaliatory actions against any individual involved in reporting or the investigation of a complaint will not be tolerated. Policy It is the policy of Wichita State University to prohibit discrimination in its employment practices, educational programs or activities on the basis of age (40 or over), ancestry, color, disability, gender, gender expression, gender identity, genetic information, marital status, national origin, political affiliation, pregnancy, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or status as a veteran. To achieve and maintain a welcoming and discrimination-free environment, it is necessary and appropriate that students, employees and visitors be encouraged to make complaints about perceived discriminatory behaviors known to University officials. For purposes of this policy, retaliation shall be defined as an adverse action or threat of an adverse action taken against a Complainant, Respondent, or any individual or group of individuals involved in the complaint, investigation, and/or resolution of an allegation of discrimination of any kind, including incidents of sexual misconduct, relationship violence or stalking. This shall also include any individual who attempts to intervene or prevent prohibited behavior. Retaliation can be committed by an individual or group of individuals, not just a Complainant or Respondent. Retaliation can take many forms including non-verbal behaviors, threats, intimidation, harassment, violence, adverse actions with respect to academic activities, work assignments, salary, vacation and other terms of employment including termination of employment. Any University student, employee, visitor or group that engages in retaliatory conduct against a University student, employee or visitor who has filed a complaint alleging discrimination, participated in an investigation or otherwise exercised their rights and privileges against perceived discrimination will be subject to disciplinary actions pursuant to established University policy up to and including termination of employment or student status. This prohibition against retaliatory conduct applies regardless of the merits of the initial complaint. Any individual who becomes aware of conduct that he/she believes may constitute retaliatory action must promptly notify the Institutional Equity and Compliance Director or designee. Failure to report is a violation of this policy. The obligation to report exists regardless of whether the individual is directly involved in the conduct and regardless of whether the conduct involves students, employees or visitors.
