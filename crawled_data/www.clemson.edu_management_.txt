We ARE Clemson Management, and I invite you to take a closer look at what we have to offer - and we have a LOT to offer! Our General Management program is top-rated, but we don't stop there – far from it. We have multiple areas of emphasis, allowing students to customize their management degrees for deeper specialization and enhanced career success. Emphasis areas include: Entrepreneurship Business Analytics Operations Human Resources Information Systems Supply Chain General Management International Management At the graduate level, we offer several degrees, again allowing students to specialize in one of these areas. For example, in 2020, we launched a joint master's degree with the College of Sciences focusing on Data Science and Analytics. For executives, we offer programs that expand strategic and leadership potential and have recently launched a truly unique Ph.D. in Executive Leadership. As I said, we have a lot going on! Our department believes in the mantra 'the people make the place,' and this place is full of amazing people. Our faculty are world-renowned scholars, publishing horizon-touching research all while providing unparalleled instruction to produce market-ready graduates.
