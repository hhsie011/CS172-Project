The UN reports that 80% of people displaced by climate change are women. This means women and girls are experiencing a disportionate amount of the consequences of climate change already through natural disasters, food shortages, and scarce resources. The panelists will delve into how environmental justice intersects with the fight for gender equity. They will discuss how climate change affects women and girl’s access to education, healthcare, and the resources they need to succeed. As well as how women and girls are taking a stand and fighting for a better environment and for their rights. This conversation will be hosted over Zoom and will be moderated by Columbia undergraduate student and Columbia Climate Conversations creator, Lauren Ritchie. The event is open to anyone who RSVPs.
