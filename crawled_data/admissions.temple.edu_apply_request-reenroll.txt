Starting the Reenrollment Process To be considered for reenrollment, you must first complete an Undergraduate Request to Reenroll form in TUportal, a communication platform for Temple students, faculty and staff to manage your access to Temple systems. To get started, follow these steps. Complete the identity verification process. After we verify your identity, your access to TUportal will be activated. Login to TUportal using your username and password. Click on Student Record Services in the TUapplications menu. Click on the Request to Reenroll link. Follow the prompts to complete the form. Once your online request form is submitted, we’ll confirm receipt via email and you’ll be contacted by an advising team member in one of Temple’s schools and colleges. Your advisor will work with you on next steps. Sending Your Transcripts If you attended another college or university while you were away, the best option is to have official transcripts sent to us electronically. From your institution’s website, simply select Temple University from the drop-down menu (if available). If your school requires that the transcript be sent via email, please have transcripts sent to ugapp@temple.edu. If your school is unable to send electronic transcripts, please request the official transcript be mailed to the following address. Temple University Undergraduate Admissions Conwell 103 1801 N.
