Research Registries and Studies Community Health Resources Announcing the 2022-2023 Innovative Intervention and Implementation Science Pilot Awards April 7, 2022 The Irving Institute’s Implementation Science Initiative, the Departments of Epidemiology and Sociomedical Sciences at the Mailman School of Public Health, and the CDC Columbia Center for Injury Science and Prevention, the NIEHS Center for Environmental Health in Northern Manhattan, and the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center announce the 2022-2023 awardees of the Intervention and Implementation Science Pilot Award. These pilot awards provide a key capacity building opportunity to stimulate the development and testing of: innovative population health or medical/clinical interventions implementation of evidence-based population health or medical/clinical interventions that have been shown to work, but have not been widely adopted, implemented or sustained in diverse and real-world global, community, clinical/health systems or policy settings. The program offers early resources for pilot, proof-of-concept projects to be conducted “in miniature”, ultimately leading to larger intervention or implementation science projects and producing new knowledge that directly impacts population health, supported by larger extramural funds. The 2022-2023 cycle prioritized applications that focused on promoting health equity and racial justice.
