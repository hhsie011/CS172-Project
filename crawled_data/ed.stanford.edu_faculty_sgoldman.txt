She is very interested in the power of real-world contexts to drive learning, and researches how people learn in and out of school. Goldman’s work focuses on creating opportunities for rich STEM learning, and for understanding how design thinking and technologies can create access and be transformational. Current work includes broadening participation in STEM via family activities, design-based engagements, and through empathy work with scientists doing outreach.
