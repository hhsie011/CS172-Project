The goal is to develop a series of programs for faculty, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows that will support development of discovery-based research courses (often called "CUREs") in STEM and the social sciences. Activities In Fall 2018, Sheridan and HHMI staff hosted a guest speaker series, as well as a Course Design Institute, which offered funding and support to develop or revise discovery-based research experiences in the context of a course. In Spring 2019, Sheridan and HHMI staff will co-taught a course to support undergraduate teaching assistants in these discovery-based research settings. Support for course implementation See this Sheridan Center Newsletter for more information A timeline for the initiative can be found here: HHMI-Sheridan Research Course Initiative TimeLine Summer 2018 Fall 2018 Spring 2019 Fall 2019 Spring 2020 Fall 2020 Planning Course Design Institute Fellows Course ENGN 1860: Advanced Fluid Mechanics BIOL 1555: Methods in Informatics and Data Science for Health Life Under Water in the Anthropocene Characterizing the Aging Process Using Caenorhabditis elegans and Reverse Genetics Open-Source Big Data Neuroscience Lab (NEUR 1630) CHEM 0500 Inorganic Chemistry Experimental analysis of vision for action and vision for perception: Are there separate mechanisms?

Students who participate in CUREs experience gains in research skill, self-efficacy, scientific identity, and ability to persist in science that are comparable to the gains made by students who participate in traditional research experiences (Brownell et al, 2015; Brownell SE, Hekmat-Scafe DS, Singla V, Chandler Seawell P, Conklin Imam JF, Eddy SL, Stearns T, Cyert MS. 2015. Corwin, Graham & Dolan, 2015; Flaherty, Walker, Forrester & Ben‐David, 2017). In addition, CURE courses make research experiences more inclusive (Bangera, Brownell & Hatfull, 2014) and more accessible to students from diverse backgrounds. Multiple opportunities to engage in research These courses will join research courses that have already been developed with HHMI support: Plant Inquiry (BIOL 0440) Alison DeLong, Associate Professor, MCB Mark Johnson, Associate Professor, MCB Introductory Biochemistry Laboratory ( BIOL 02850) Kristina Cohen, HHMI Postdoctoral Fellow Sarah Taylor, Instructional Coordinator/Science Learning Specialist, BioMed Yiannis Sawa, Investigator in MCB Gerald Jogl, Associate Professor, MCB Advanced Fluid Mechanics (ENGN 1860) Daniel Harris, Assistant Professor of Engineering Kristy Schlueter-Kuck, Postdoctoral Research Associate in Engineering Open-Source Big Data Neuroscience Lab (NEUR 1630) Alexander Fleischmann, Endowed Professorship in Brain Science, Associate Professor of Neuroscience Monica Linden, Senior Lecturer in Neuroscience Characterizing the Aging Process Using Caenorhabditis elegans and Reverse Genetics Joslyn Mills-Bonal, Postdoctoral Research Associate in Molecular Biology, Cell Biology and Biochemistry Louis Lapierre, Assistant Professor of Molecular Biology, Cell Biology and Biochemistry Life under water in the Anthropocene (CLPS 1195) Ruth Colville, Professor of Cognitive, Linguistic and Psychological Sciences Andrea Simmons, Professor of Cognitive, Linguistic and Psychological Sciences Experimental analysis of vision for action and vision for perception: Are there separate mechanisms?
