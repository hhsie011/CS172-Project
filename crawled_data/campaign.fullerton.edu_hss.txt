True to the liberal arts tradition, our subjects of study are the concepts upon which modern society is built: justice, freedom, democracy, race, the good life, religion and human responsibility to one another and to nature. With your investment, we will continue to provide an education that challenges students to solve problems, teaches them to ask which problems to address and prepares them for lives of compassionate leadership and responsibility. We will develop courses, events and research that champion social justice and engage students and faculty with the urban community. We will share the vision for a welcoming space whose presence reflects the enduring value of the humanities and social sciences.
