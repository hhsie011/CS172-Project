View the FAQ Truett Seminary applies over $5.5 million in scholarship and institutional support every year. This is made possible by the generosity of Baylor University as well as many other gracious donors and supporters. Scholarship awards are limited to published attempted hours total. Scholarship awards may be extended for Baptist students and students in the joint degree programs. Click here to view current tuition rates for Baylor's Truett Seminary. Denominational Student Scholarships Both active members of Baptist* churches and active members of Methodist/Wesleyan churches are eligible to receive additional scholarships. We are grateful to the generosity of the Baptist General Convention of Texas for providing the Baptist student scholarships and to the supporters who have made the Methodist/Wesleyan scholarships possible. Master of Divinity Doctor of Ministry $150 per credit hour Master of Arts in Christian Ministry Master of Theological Studies Master of Arts in Contextual Witness and Innovation Master of Arts in Theology, Ecology, and Food Justice Master of Arts in Theology and Sports Studies $100 per credit hour The appropriate completed Church Certification Forms are required for receipt of these denominational scholarships. *Incoming students who are members of any Baptist church may initially qualify for the Baptist Student Scholarship and may have their church sign off on the Baptist Church Certification Form. In subsequent years, in order to continue to receive the Baptist Student Scholarship, students must be involved with a Baptist General Convention of Texas (BGCT), or Texas Baptists, church and have that church sign off on the Baptist Church Certification Form. (Due to the online nature of the program, students pursuing the M.A. in Theology and Sports Studies may continue to qualify for the scholarship by attending any Baptist church.) Full and Partial Tuition Scholarships Truett Seminary awards a number of scholarships to incoming students, ranging up to the full cost of tuition. All incoming students are encouraged to complete the Truett Scholarship Application in order to be considered for a full or partial tuition scholarship award. Learn More and Apply Partnership Scholarships Accepted students are welcome and encouraged to utilize the Partner Scholarship resources provided in order to request additional scholarship funds from their church. These funds will be deposited directly into the student’s account to defray any remaining costs after Truett’s scholarship funds are awarded. Learn More Baptist Matching Scholarship Baylor University will match on a dollar-for-dollar basis, not to exceed $1,000 in an academic year, scholarship funds given to Baptist students from a Baptist church, state Baptist convention or Baptist-affiliated program. Duly authorized Baptist church leaders must certify a statement for each check in order to request matching funds. Checks and statements must be received by the Cashier's Office in order for matching funds to be applied. Matching funds are available for fall and spring semesters for full-time students in good standing. Matching funds are not available for the summer term.
