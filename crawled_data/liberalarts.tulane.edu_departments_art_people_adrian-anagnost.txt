Poesch Professorship in Art Director of Graduate Studies aanagnos@tulane.edu 305 Woldenberg Art Center Education Ph.D. University of Chicago, Art History Biography Adrian Anagnost teaches modern and contemporary art, focusing on intersections of art and architecture in the U.S., Latin America, and Europe after 1960. Research interests include art and urbanism; museum architecture and exhibition design; artistic networks; performance and participation; and theories of “the social” in 20th- and 21st-century art. Anagnost's book manuscript on modernist architecture and urbanism in art of twentieth-century Brazil will be published by Yale University Press in 2021. New research includes an examination of relationships between contemporary artists and institutions, focusing on the networked practices of Theaster Gates and Tania Bruguera; and an image theory project on representations of architecture in the Atlantic World.
