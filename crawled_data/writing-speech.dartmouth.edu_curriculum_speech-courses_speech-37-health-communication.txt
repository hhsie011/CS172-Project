We will examine basic medical models, the roles of health professionals, patients and caregivers, social and cultural issues, communication in health organizations, and the role of mass media. Emphasis will be on the social analysis of social support, ethics, organizational culture, planning health promotion campaigns, cultural conceptions of health and illness, and social scientific theory. No prerequisites. Limited enrollment. Instructor: Drummond. Distributive: SOC Offered: 21F: 8L; 23W: 10A. Course Goals Throughout your lifetime you will need to exercise communication competence in a variety of health-care situations as either a health professional, patient, lay caregiver, or as the loved one of a patient. However, communication in most health-care encounters is often ineffective, leading to problems of miscommunication, misinformation, dehumanization, insensitivity, and dissatisfaction. Unfortunately, such ineffective and inappropriate communication often leads to a lack of cooperation between health-care providers and consumers resulting in nonadherence to medical regimens. This course provides the opportunity through social analysis to examine this problem. On a personal level, after taking this course, you will be empowered to use communication to achieve your own health-care goals and assist individuals in your social networks to achieve theirs. On a professional level, you will understand your ethical responsibility to engage in the most effective and appropriate communication “to do no harm” and then regularly examine and attempt to improve your communication skills within the context of healthcare. Learning Outcomes: After completing this course, you will be able to: Explain various medical models and social scientific theories. Apply in written formats major social scientific theory to various communication events. Know the ethical responsibilities of communicating effectively when health issues are involved. Differentiate effective from ineffective messages related to health aimed at different audiences as a result of social analysis. Understand the diverse communication needs of various groups through social analysis (e.g., cultural, ethnic, occupational, age-related, gender, etc.) in regards to health. Analyze decision-making processes related to health and risk behavior across various contexts (i.e., interpersonal, familial and organizational). Present orally a theoretically-based analysis of a health communication artifact and/or event.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Institute for Writing and Rhetoric Philosophy & Aims About Writing at Dartmouth Speech at Dartmouth Our Stories The Story of Writing Instruction at Dartmouth The Story of Speech at Dartmouth The Story of Writing Support at Dartmouth Curriculum Overview Writing Courses Writing 2-3 WRIT 5 First-Year Seminars Humanities 1-2 Speech Courses Speech 20 Speech 25 Speech 26 Speech 27 Speech 30 Speech 31 Speech 33 Speech 34 Speech 36 Speech 37 Speech 40 Placement and Enrollment Policies First-Year Writing & First-Year Seminar Requirements Differences Among First-Year Writing Courses FAQ Directed Self-Placement Process for Writing Registration for Writing 5 or Writing 2-3 Registration for First Year Seminars FAQ First-year Writing Registration First-year Writing Choices Prizes Writing Prize Winners Speech Contest Winners Speech Contest Call for Entries Learning Overview Writing Center Make an Appointment Materials Sources and Citations at Dartmouth Teaching Overview Guidelines Teaching Writing in the First Year Expectations for Writing 2-3 Expectations for Writing 5 Teaching the First-Year Seminar First-Year Writing: Pedagogies, Methods, & Design Active Learning in the First-Year Writing Classroom Syllabus and Assignment Design Teaching Writing as Process Integrating Reading and Writing Diagnosing and Responding to Student Writing Conducting Writing Workshops Collaborative Learning/Learning with Peers Teaching Argument Teaching Research Addressing Grammar Useful links Support The Writing Assistant Program Research Past Research Activities Research Overview Multilingual Overview Support for Undergraduate Students Support for Graduate Students Faculty Support News & People People News Employment Upcoming Events Past Events My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
