My expertise includes dendrochronology, plant ecophysiology, remote sensing, and climate science. I received his PhD in 2020 Columbia University. In my research I have investigated flooding in the Brahmaputra and Indus Rivers in South Asia and the impact of dzud (cold winters that cause livestock mortality) on pastoral nomadic herding communities in Mongolia. I am is currently working on projects to understand the forest carbon cycle, the vulnerability of boreal forests and livestock herding in Mongolia to climate change, and the use of dendroarchaeology to reveal the hidden stories behind the construction of New York City in the 19th and early 20th century.
