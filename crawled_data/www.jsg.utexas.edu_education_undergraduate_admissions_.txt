Everything students need to know to apply for undergraduate admission to both the Jackson School and The University of Texas at Austin can be found on the UT Office of Admissions website. Academic units at the university do not directly process admissions for incoming freshmen or external transfers. Undergraduates already enrolled at The University of Texas at Austin may apply to enter the Jackson School as an internal transfer admission. Applications are accepted each spring for admission to the Jackson School the following fall semester. Visit the Jackson School’s Internal Transfers webpage for details about the application process, deadlines and upcoming information session dates. All students apply to the Jackson School following the standard procedures for the university, as outlined in the UT Austin General Information and Undergraduate Catalog.
