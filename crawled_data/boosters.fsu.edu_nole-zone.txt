Our goal is to create an intense home environment in the Tucker Center for opposing teams when they come to Tallahassee. We have 19 board members and operate as an extension of Seminole Student Boosters, working alongside leadership in Seminole Boosters Inc. and The Florida State Athletic Department. Our intentions are to increase student engagement and support for the FSU men’s basketball team. Our mission to build that environment will be fulfilled by bringing the FSU student community together through their passion for Seminole Athletics. On top of the work that we’ve done with men’s basketball, we hope to expand this level of support across all twenty Division I programs on campus with a base of dedicated and passionate students who love Florida State athletics. We would love to see you supporting our men's basketball team this season! If you want to meet us or find out more information about getting involved, see our contact information below.
