The curriculum prepares majors for graduate education in these fields and also provides a relevant background for social work, education, medicine, law, and business. Psychology course offerings are designed to meet the varying needs and interests of students, from those wishing to explore a few topics in psychology or to fulfill the science requirement, to those interested in majoring in Psychology or in Neuroscience and Behavior. Program Goals The department's program goals start with the development of a solid knowledge base in psychological science. Consistent with the value psychology places on empirical evidence, courses at every level of the curriculum nurture the development of skills in research methods, quantitative literacy, and critical thinking, and foster respect for the ethical values that undergird the science of psychology. Most of these program goals are introduced in PSYC UN1001 The Science of Psychology, the recommended first psychology course required for all majors that satisfies the prerequisite for most 2000-level courses. These goals are extended and reinforced in our statistics (1600-level) and research methods (1400-level) research methods courses, as well as in the 2000-level lecture courses and 3000- and 4000-level seminars. Each of the 2000-level lecture courses enables students to study systematically, and in greater depth, one of the content areas introduced in PSYC UN1001 The Science of Psychology. These lecture courses are the principal means by which psychology majors satisfy the distribution requirements, ensuring not only depth but also breadth of coverage across three central areas of psychology: (1) perception and cognition, courses in the 2200s, (2) psychobiology and neuroscience, courses in the 2400s, and (3) social, personality, and abnormal psychology, courses in the 2600s. To complete the major, students take one or more advanced seminars and are encouraged to participate in supervised research courses, where they have the opportunity to explore research questions in depth and further develop their written and oral communication skills. Research Participation All qualified students are welcome to apply to join a research lab and contribute to ongoing projects. Students may volunteer to work in a lab, register for supervised individual research (PSYC UN3950 Supervised Individual Research), or participate in the department’s Senior Thesis Research Intensive Program. Information on faculty research is available on the departmental website. Students are advised to read about research laboratories on faculty lab sites and visit the professor’s office hours to discuss opportunities. At the beginning of the fall term, the department also hosts a Lab-Preview event for students to learn about research opportunities for the upcoming semester. Program Planning Majors and concentrators in psychology and majors in neuroscience and behavior should begin planning a program of study as early as possible. All necessary forms and information are available in Program Planning Tips. All majors and concentrators in Psychology and majors in Neuroscience and Behavior should complete a Major Requirement Checklist before consulting a program adviser to discuss program plans. At minimum, all students must submit a Major Requirement Checklist prior to the start of their final semester, so that graduation eligibility can be certified. Once the MRC is submitted, the Undergraduate Curriculum Assistant and the DUS's will review your curriculum plans and advise if changes need to be made. Advising The Department of Psychology offers a variety of advising resources to provide prospective and current undergraduate majors and concentrators with the information and support needed to successfully plan their programs. An overview of these resources is provided on the Psychology Undergraduate Advising Resources website. Students are encouraged to consult with Peer, Faculty, and Program Advisers as they plan their course of study in Psychology or Neuroscience and Behavior. Faculty and Peer Advisers are important contacts for general advice on class choices, research opportunities, and post-graduation plans. For definitive answers to questions regarding major requirements and other aspects of your degree, including transfer credit, current and prospective majors should consult their Program Adviser (Director of Undergraduate Studies) or the Undergraduate Curriculum Assistant in the departmental office. Program Adviser assignments and contact information are provided on the departmental website. For additional information about program, faculty, peer, and pre-clinical advising, please see the Psychology Undergraduate Advising Resources website. Email Communication The department maintains an e-mail distribution list with the UNIs of all declared majors and concentrators. Students are held responsible for information sent to their Columbia e-mail addresses. Students should read these messages from the department regularly and carefully. They are intended to keep students informed about deadlines, requirements, events, and opportunities. Prospective majors or concentrators who would like to be added to the e-mail distribution list should contact the Undergraduate Curriculum Assistant in the departmental office. Guide to Course Numbers Course numbers reflect the structure of the Psychology curriculum: The 1000-level comprises introductions to psychology, introductory research methods courses, and statistics. PSYC UN1001 The Science of Psychology is an introductory course with no prerequisites, which can serve as the prerequisite for most of the 2000-level courses. PSYC UN1021 Science of Psychology: Explorations and Applications is an alternative version of PSYC UN1001 The Science of Psychology and fulfills the same requirements. The 1400s contain the research methods laboratory courses, and the 1600s contain statistics courses; these two course types are designed to prepare students to be able to understand, critique, and conduct the types of research found in many psychology and neuroscience labs. The 2000-level comprises lecture courses that are introductions to areas within psychology; most require PSYC UN1001 The Science of Psychology as a prerequisite. The 3000-level comprises more advanced and specialized undergraduate courses; most are given in a seminar format and require instructor permission. The 3900s are the courses providing research opportunities for undergraduates. The 4000-level comprises advanced seminars suitable for both advanced undergraduates and graduate students, and require instructor permission. Subcategories within the 2000-, 3000-, and 4000-levels correspond to the three groups in our distribution requirement for undergraduate Psychology majors: Perception and cognition (2200s, 3200s, and 4200s), Psychobiology and neuroscience (2400s, 3400s, and 4400s), and Social, personality, and abnormal psychology (2600s, 3600s, and 4600s). Additionally, we designate Integrative and Applied courses using x800s (e.g., GU4880) and Advanced Topics in Psychology Research using the x900s (e.g., UN1910, UN1920, UN1930, UN1990, GU4930) Note that Barnard psychology courses do not follow the same numbering scheme. Senior Thesis Advanced Research Starting in Fall 2021, we will be restructuring the Honors program to become the Psych/Neuro Senior Thesis Advanced Research program. This change is intended to expand the number of Psychology and Neuroscience & Behavior students we can accept into this rigorous training program. (Note that this change goes into effect for all new applicants; policies for students that have already been enrolled in ‘Honors’ will remain as they were prior to this change.) Students with strong interests in psychological/neuroscientific research are encouraged to apply for admission to the Psychology Department's Psych/Neuro Senior Thesis Advanced Research program in the fall of their junior year or the equivalent, such that they will be able to participate in the three consecutive semesters (spring - fall - spring) that are required in the program. Important: Students will need to confirm that a professor has agreed to mentor them before being admitted into the program. Therefore, interested applicants should reach out to potential mentors to find a lab placement before applying. Tip: The best way to ensure finding a mentor is to get involved in that mentor’s research before asking if they can provide mentoring/supervision on your thesis. Please read through all the information below before submitting your application. Students interested in engaging in a Psych/Neuro Senior Thesis: The series includes: Enrolling in a 3-semester Senior Thesis Advanced Research series, which includes a weekly seminar and research commitment, that must occur consecutively in your Junior year spring semester and Senior year (fall & spring), or equivalent [NOTE: this research course includes performing intensive, independent research with a lab mentor, writing a final thesis, and oral presentation of the thesis at the end of the 3rd semester] Enrolling in a one-semester methods course (PSYC UN1920, UN1420/21, UN1450/51, UN1455/56, UN1490/91) in any semester during undergrad (i.e., before or during the series). Students are strongly encouraged to complete this methods training during or before the spring of their junior year (or equivalent). Students interested in engaging in a Psych/Neuro Senior Thesis and aspiring to be eligible for Academic Honors in Psychology or Neuroscience and Behavior: All students aspiring to graduate with Academic Honors must enroll in the series described above. However, acceptance to and participation in this program does not automatically result in earning academic honors (see requirements for academic honors below). Note the students majoring in Neuroscience & Behavior may earn academic honors through the Department of Biological Sciences instead. (Please check their website for more details on that process.) Honors Requirements: The Psych/Neuro Senior Thesis Advanced Research program is open to students majoring in Psychology or Neuroscience & Behavior and includes the following: Senior Thesis Advanced Research Seminar (UN3930): This is a two-hour, 1-4 credit course that meets biweekly, during which students present and discuss their ongoing research. Students in the course also attend the Psychology Department's Colloquium Series, which features researchers from outside the Department speaking on a variety of topics in Psychology/Neuroscience. The seminar and colloquia always take place on Wednesdays from 4:10 - 6:00 p.m. Students in the Psych/Neuro Senior Thesis Advanced Research program enroll in this course during the spring of their junior year and during the fall and spring of their senior years, or the equivalent. Senior Thesis Research: Starting in the spring of their junior year and continuing through senior year, all students in the Psych/Neuro Senior Thesis Advanced Research program conduct research under the supervision of a Psychology Department faculty member or a faculty member/principal investigator in a psychology- or neuroscience-focused lab outside the department, including at Barnard College, the Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia Business School, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, and other research institutions in the area. Research Methods Course: To fulfill this requirement, students should complete a methods course (PSYC UN1920 The How-To's of Research; PSYC UN1420/21 Research Methods: Human Behavior; PSYC UN1450/51 Research Methods: Social Cognition & Emotion; PSYC UN1455/56 Research Methods: Social & Personality Psychology; PSYC UN1490/91 Research Methods: Cognition & Decision-making). Senior Thesis: Students in the Psych/Neuro Senior Thesis Advanced Research program complete an original research project under the supervision of their faculty advisor. Senior students present their research orally at the last colloquium of the Spring term, and also submit a written senior thesis. Eligibility for Academic Honors: Students participating in the Psych/Neuro Senior Thesis Advanced Research program are also eligible to receive academic honors when they graduate, provided they 1) complete all components of the program, 2) earn a GPA in the major of 3.6 or higher at the time of graduation, and 3) are recommended by the Psychology department faculty. Please note that academic honors can be awarded to no more than 10% of the graduating class each year, so while only students who have participated in this senior thesis research intensive are eligible to receive academic honors, not everyone in the Senior Thesis Advanced Research program will receive academic honors. How to Apply: The application is due in mid fall, and decisions are communicated in time for admitted students to register to begin Psych/Neuro Senior Thesis Advanced Research-related classes in the spring. The application process comprises the following steps: Identifying a lab sponsor: If you think you might be interested in applying, you should start reaching out to labs that you’re interested in well in advance of the application deadline to see if they might have openings for research assistants and if they’d be willing to mentor you in your research. Keep in mind that mentoring a student is a significant commitment on the part of a professor, and so it may be difficult to identify a professor who can provide mentorship. You can find more information/advice on securing research opportunities in labs on our courseworks site. Successful applicants typically demonstrate how their own research interests fall in line with those of their proposed sponsor and attest that their faculty member/PI has agreed to sponsor them. Once you have secured a position in a lab, you and your mentor will need to fill out the mentor agreement form. Complete the online application: The application will be made available on our psychology department website, and comprises a few relatively short questions asking students to describe their previous coursework and research-related experiences and to write about their intended research interests. Requirements for Admission to Graduate Programs in Psychology Most graduate programs in psychology, including those in clinical psychology, require: Course List Code Title Points An undergraduate course in introductory psychology: PSYC UN1001 The Science of Psychology A course in statistics such as one of the following: PSYC UN1610 Introductory Statistics for Behavioral Scientists PSYC UN1660 Advanced Statistical Inference STAT UN1001 INTRO TO STATISTICAL REASONING STAT UN1101 Introduction to Statistics STAT UN1201 Calculus-Based Introduction to Statistics A laboratory course in research methods such as one of the following: PSYC UN1420 RESEARCH METHODS - HUMAN BEHAVIOR PSYC UN1450 RESEARCH METHODS - SOCIAL COGNITION ＆ EMOTION PSYC UN1455 RESEARCH METHODS: SOCIAL/PERSONALITY PSYC UN1490 RESEARCH METHODS - COGNITION/DECISION MAKING Students should also take a variety of more advanced undergraduate courses and seminars. Students interested in PhD programs in any area of psychology are very strongly encouraged to participate in a research lab and may wish to enroll in PSYC UN3950 Supervised Individual Research. Students are also encouraged to apply for the Senior Thesis Research Intensive program in the early fall of their junior year. Students interested in clinical psychology should obtain experience working in a community service program in addition to supervised individual research experience. Students should consult the department's pre-clinical adviser, Prof. E'mett McCaskill, and attend the department's pre-clinical advising events for more information. Additional resources to help prepare students for graduate study in psychology, and for careers in clinical psychology, are available on the Department of Psychology’s website. Students may also sign-up for the preclinical advising listserv to receive emails about events and relevant information. Online Information The Department of Psychology website provides access to a wide variety of information for majors and prospective majors. Among other useful resources, students will find syllabi posted for most lecture and lab courses and for many advanced seminars. Students should read the on-line course syllabi prior to registering for psychology courses. For assistance in finding all necessary resources, students should contact the undergraduate curriculum assistant (psych-uca@columbia.edu). Science Requirement PSYC UN1001 The Science of Psychology, PSYC UN1021 Science of Psychology: Explorations and Applications, PSYC UN1010 Mind, Brain and Behavior (no longer offered), and any PSYC course in the 2200- or 2400-level may be used to fulfill the science requirement. 2600-level and some other psychology courses, including PSYC BC1001 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY and other Barnard psychology courses, may not be used to fulfill the science requirement. All 3- and 4-point courses numbered in the 32xx, 34xx, 42xx, and 44xx can partially fulfill the science requirement. With prior departmental approval, some additional courses may also be used to partially fulfill the science requirement. For more detailed information regarding psychology courses that may be applied toward the science requirement, see the Core Curriculum section in this bulletin. With prior departmental approval, 3- and 4-point courses numbered in the 32xx, 34xx, 42xx, and 44xx, and some additional courses, may partially fulfill the science requirement. For more detailed information regarding psychology courses that may be applied toward the science requirement, see Core Requirements in the General Studies bulletin. Evening and Columbia Summer Courses The department normally offers at least one lab course in the late afternoon with evening labs. A number of other courses are occasionally offered in late afternoon and evening hours. No more than one quarter of the courses required for the major are normally available in the evening. Working students may find early morning (8:40 a.m.) classes, as well as Summer Session offerings, helpful in completing degree requirements. Any course offered by the Psychology Department during the Summer Session is applicable toward the same major requirement(s) as the corresponding course of that same number offered during the academic year. For instance, PSYC S1001D The Science of Psychology meets the same major requirements as does PSYC UN1001 The Science of Psychology. See Academic Regulations—Study Outside Columbia College in this Bulletin for additional information. See Summer Courses for policies governing Summer Session courses.

Overlapping Courses Students cannot receive credit for two courses—one completed at Columbia and one at another institution (including Barnard)—if those courses have largely overlapping content. For example, PSYC UN1001 The Science of Psychology is similar in content to introductory psychology courses offered at many other institutions, including Barnard; only one such course will receive credit. Similarly, PSYC UN2630 Social Psychology and PSYC BC1138 Social Psychology have overlapping content; only one will receive credit. Please refer to the table of Overlapping Courses for a partial list of courses at Columbia and Barnard that are known to overlap. Grade Requirements for the Major A grade of C- or higher must be earned and revealed on the transcript in any Columbia or Barnard course, including the first, that is used to satisfy the major requirements. The grade of P is not accepted for credit towards the Psychology major, Psychology concentration, or Neuroscience and Behavior major. Courses taken on a Pass/D/Fail basis may not be used to satisfy the major or concentration requirements unless the grade of P is uncovered by the Registrar's deadline. Students may petition to have their P/D/F grades uncovered after the registrar's deadline for the following three courses only: PSYC UN1001 Science of Psychology, PSYC UN1010 Mind, Brain, & Behavior (no longer offered), and PSYC UN1610 Introductory Statistics for Behavioral Scientists. Courses taken for a P grade may not be used to satisfy the major or concentration requirements, except for P grades earned in the Spring 2020 semester. Major Requirement Checklist Prior to the start of their final semester, all seniors must submit a Major Requirement Checklist showing all major courses they have taken and those they plan to take. The Psychology department evaluates each checklist to determine whether or not the course plan completes the major requirements and then notifies the student accordingly. If the student's course plan changes, or if it does not satisfy the major requirements, a revised checklist must be submitted. Departmental approval of an accurate and up-to-date checklist will help ensure completion of all major requirements on time for graduation. Major in Psychology Please read Guidelines for all Psychology Majors, Concentrators, and Interdepartmental Majors above. The Psychology Major requirements changed in 2020. Students entering an undergraduate degree program at Columbia in Fall 2020 or later must complete the new major requirements. Students who entered Columbia prior to Fall 2020 may choose to complete either the new major requirements or the old ones. New Major Requirements (for students entering Columbia Fall 2020 or later) Students must complete 11 courses in Psychology or an approved cognate discipline. To count toward the major, a course must be taken for 3 or more points. At least 6 of the 11 courses must be in the Columbia Psychology Department. These 11 courses must include: Introductory Psychology Course One Statistics course One Research Methods course One Group I Course One Group II Course One Group III Course One course meeting the Seminar requirement One course meeting the integrative/applied Special Elective requirement Enough PSYC electives to complete 11 courses Each course may fulfill only one of these major requirements. See below for details on each of these requirements. Old Major Requirements (for students entering Columbia prior to Fall 2020) Students must complete 30 or more points to complete the Psychology Major. Those 30 points must include: Introductory Psychology Course One Statistics course One Research Methods course One Group I Course One Group II Course One Group III Course One course meeting the Seminar requirement Enough PSYC electives to complete 30 points See below for details on each of these requirements. Note that no course may be counted twice in fulfillment of the major requirements. The Introductory Psychology Course PSYC UN1001 The Science of Psychology A Statistics Course Select one of the following: PSYC UN1610 Introductory Statistics for Behavioral Scientists PSYC UN1660 Advanced Statistical Inference STAT UN1001 INTRO TO STATISTICAL REASONING STAT UN1101 Introduction to Statistics (formerly STAT W1111) STAT UN1201 Calculus-Based Introduction to Statistics (formerly STAT W1211) A Research Methods Course Select one of the following: PSYC UN1420 RESEARCH METHODS - HUMAN BEHAVIOR PSYC UN1450 RESEARCH METHODS - SOCIAL COGNITION ＆ EMOTION PSYC UN1455 RESEARCH METHODS: SOCIAL/PERSONALITY PSYC UN1490 RESEARCH METHODS - COGNITION/DECISION MAKING Majors are strongly advised to complete the statistics and research methods requirements, in that order, by the fall term of their junior year. Students are advised to verify the specific prerequisites for research methods courses, most of which require prior completion of a statistics course. Distribution Requirement One course (3 points or more) must be taken from each of the following three groups (in addition to the introductory, statistics, and research methods courses described above): Group I—Perception and cognition: courses numbered in the 2200s, 3200s, or 4200s. Group II—Psychobiology and neuroscience: courses numbered in the 2400s, 3400s, or 4400s. Also PSYC UN1010 Mind, Brain and Behavior (no longer offered). Group III—Social, personality, and abnormal: courses numbered in the 2600s, 3600s, or 4600s. As of Fall 2019, Research Methods courses no longer fulfill any of the Group distribution requirements. Seminar Requirement In addition, students must complete one course meeting the Seminar requirement. A seminar course must be taken for 3 or more points. All courses offered through the Columbia Psychology Department and numbered in the 3200s, 3400s, 3600s, 4200s, 4400s, and 4600s count toward the seminar requirement. Not all Barnard courses taught in a seminar format fulfill this requirement—see Barnard Courses, below, for more information. Seminars are usually taken in the junior and senior year as a culmination of the major program, but any students who have met the prerequisites and gain the instructor’s permission to join the course may enroll. Enrollment in all seminar courses requires the instructor's permission; students are advised to contact instructors at least one month prior to registration to request seminar admission. Note that honors, senior thesis research intensive, and supervised individual research courses (PSYC UN3910 Honors Seminar, PSYC UN3920 Honors Research, PSYC UN3930 Senior Thesis Research Intensive Seminar, and PSYC UN3950 Supervised Individual Research) will not meet the seminar requirement. For those completing the new major requirements, no course may be counted twice in fulfillment of the above major requirements: separate courses must be taken to fulfill the seminar requirement and each distribution group. Special Elective (for the New Major requirements) For students entering Columbia in Fall 2020 or later, one course must be taken to fulfill the integrative/applied Special Elective. The Special Elective encompasses a wide range of courses: those that cut across and connect different sub-disciplines within psychology; those that integrate psychology with other disciplines; those that apply psychology to real-world problems; those that dig deeper into advanced statistics and methods topics; and those that offer hands-on experience with psychology research. The following courses are pre-approved to count toward the Special Elective requirement. If you would like to count a course that does not appear on this list, please contact your Program Advisor prior to enrolling. PSYC UN3950 SUPERVISED INDIVIDUAL RESEARCH or PSYC UN3920 Honors Research (taken for 3 or 4 points) or PSYC UN3930 Senior Thesis Research Intensive Seminar PSYC UN1910 Research Ethics in Psychology PSYC UN1930 Behavioral Data Science PSYC UN1990 Global Behavioral Science PSYC UN3615 Children at Risk (Lecture) PSYC GU4612 Frontiers of Justice PSYC GU4930 Fundamentals of Human Brain Imaging: from theory to practice STAT UN2102 Applied Statistical Computing STAT GU4243 APPLIED DATA SCIENCE PSYC BC1088 THE SCIENCE OF LIVING WELL PSYC BC2175 Addictive Behaviors (overlaps with PSYC 2460 Drugs & Behavior) PSYC BC3155 Psychology and Law PSYC BC3465 Field Work ＆ Research Seminar: Toddler Center PSYC BC3466 FIELD WORK ＆ RESEARCH SEMINAR: TODDLER CENTER PSYC BC3473 Clinical Field Practicum PHIL V2400 Psychology and Philosophy of Human Experience NSBV BC3387 Topics in Neuroethics Electives Additional psychology courses ("electives") must be taken for a total of 30 points (or 11 courses for the new major requirements). Once a student has met the specific requirements of the major, any other psychology or approved cognate courses they take to complete the 30-point (or, for students entering Columbia in Fall 2020 or later, the 11-course) minimum constitute electives. As described below, these may include a limited number of research courses, transfer courses, and Barnard psychology courses not approved for specific requirements. No course may be counted twice in fulfillment of the above major requirements. Research Credits No more than 4 points of PSYC UN3950 Supervised Individual Research or PSYC UN3920 Honors Research may be taken in any one term, and no more than 8 points total of research and field work courses (PSYC UN3950 SUPERVISED INDIVIDUAL RESEARCH, PSYC BC3466 FIELD WORK ＆ RESEARCH SEMINAR: TODDLER CENTER, PSYC BC3473 Clinical Field Practicum, PSYC BC3592 Senior Research Seminar and PSYC BC3599 Individual Projects) may be applied toward the major. See below for further restrictions on applying Barnard courses toward the psychology major. Under the new 11-course major, research courses must be taken for 3 or 4 points in order to count toward the major; a maximum of 2 such courses may be applied towards the major. (See below for further restrictions on applying Barnard courses toward the psychology major). Barnard Courses For students completing the 30-point major: No more than 9 credits in Barnard courses (or a combination of transfer and Barnard credits) may be applied toward the major. For students completing the 11-course major: A maximum of 5 courses counted toward the major may be from outside Columbia ("outside Columbia" includes both Barnard and transfer courses). The table of approved Barnard psychology courses indicates which courses have been approved for specific requirements of the psychology major. Courses not on the approved list may only be applied toward a specific requirement with prior written approval from one of the directors of undergraduate studies. Psychology courses not on the approved list for a specific requirement may be applied as elective credit toward the 30 points for the major (or towards the 11 courses needed for the new major requirements). As of Fall 2019, Barnard Lab courses do not count towards the Research Methods requirement of the Psychology Major or Concentration. Non-Psychology Courses For students completing the 11-course major: Some courses offered outside of Psychology departments can count toward major requirements (e.g., courses taken in the Statistics Department; cognate courses offered through Philosophy, Business, Law, etc.). A maximum of 2 such non-PSYC courses may be applied toward the major. Courses offered in the Barnard Psychology or Neuroscience departments do not count toward this limit. Transfer Credits For students completing the 30-point major: No more than 9 transfer credits (or a combination of transfer and Barnard credits) will be accepted toward the psychology major. For students completing the 11-course major: No more than 3 transfer courses can be applied toward the psychology major. Any transfer courses thus applied count toward the limit of 5 courses from outside Columbia. Approval of transfer credits on a student’s Entrance Credit Report toward general requirements for the B.A. degree does not grant approval of these credits toward the psychology major. Students must apply for written approval of transfer credit towards the major by submitting the Major Requirement Substitution Form. This form, along with additional information about transfer credits can be found on the Transfer Credit page of our website. To be approved for the major, a course taken at another institution should be substantially similar to one offered by the department, the grade received must be a B- or better, and the course must have been taken within the past 8 years. As noted above, if two courses overlap in content, only one will be applied towards the major. With the exception of approved Barnard courses, students should consult with one of the directors of undergraduate studies before registering for psychology courses offered outside the department. Students who have completed an introductory psychology course at another institution prior to declaring a psychology major should submit a Major Requirement Substitution Form to verify whether or not this course meets departmental standards for major transfer credit. If transfer credit toward the major is not approved, the student must enroll in PSYC UN1001 The Science of Psychology or PSYC UN1021 Science of Psychology: Explorations and Applications or PSYC BC1001 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY to complete this major requirement. AP Psychology Transfer Credit As of Fall 2019, the Psychology Department will accept a score of 5 on the AP Psychology exam, or a score of 7 on the Higher Level IB Psychology exam, to meet the Science of Psychology requirement. The AP/IB Psychology exam does not count as a course or toward a student’s points total for their program; students placing out of the Science of Psychology requirement in this way will need to take an additional course to fulfill the required number of courses or points for their program. The College Board Advanced Placement (AP) statistics scores do not satisfy the statistics requirement. Students who have completed AP statistics may opt to take a more advanced statistics course to fulfill this requirement with the approval of one of the directors of undergraduate studies. Major in Neuroscience and Behavior Please read Guidelines for all Psychology Majors, Concentrators, and Interdepartmental Majors above. The department cosponsors an interdepartmental major in neuroscience and behavior with the Department of Biological Sciences. For assistance in planning the psychology portion of the neuroscience and behavior major, refer to the Program Planning Tips website and use the appropriate major requirement checklist.

Generally speaking, permission for such exceptions is only granted when there is a compelling case related to the student’s research or area of study. Students requesting permission to use a course not on this list must ensure that their substantive coursework in the seminar (generally their final paper) is on a neuroscience-focused topic. Transfer Credit for Psychology Courses Taken Elsewhere Students should consult a psychology adviser before registering for psychology courses offered outside the department. With the adviser's approval, one, and only one, course from another institution, including Barnard, may be applied toward the psychology portion of the Neuroscience and Behavior major. Students who wish to obtain credit for a course taken at Barnard or at another institution should complete the Major Requirement Substitution Form. To be approved for the major, the course should be substantially similar to one offered by this department and approved for this major, and the grade received must be a C- or better if from Barnard, or B- or better if from another institution. As of Fall 2019, the Psychology department accepts a score of 5 on the AP Psychology exam, or a score of 7 on the Higher Level IB Psychology exam, to meet the PSYC UN1001 The Science of Psychology requirement. The AP/IB Psychology exam does not count as a course or toward a student’s points total for their program; students placing out of the Science of Psychology requirement in this way will need to take an additional course -- approved by the Psychology adviser -- to fulfill the required number of courses for their program. Advanced Placement (AP) statistics scores will not satisfy the statistics/research methods requirement. Students who have completed AP Statistics are encouraged to enroll in a 1400-level research methods course to fulfill this requirement. Exceptions to Biology Requirements Any exceptions must be approved in advance by a biology adviser and students must receive an email notification of that approval. Students may substitute Barnard College courses only with prior permission from a Biology Department adviser. Concentration in Psychology Please read Guidelines for all Psychology Majors, Concentrators, and Interdepartmental Majors above. The Psychology Concentration requirements changed in 2020. Students entering an undergraduate degree program at Columbia in Fall 2020 or later must complete the new concentration requirements. Students who entered Columbia prior to Fall 2020 may choose to complete either the new concentration requirements or the old ones. New Concentration Requirements (for students entering Columbia Fall 2020 or later) Students must complete 7 courses in Psychology or an approved cognate discipline. To count toward the concentration, a course must be taken for 3 or more points. The following requirements must be met: 1.

PSYC GU4223 Memory and Executive Function Thru the Lifespan. 4 points. Prerequisites: the instructor's permission, plus PSYC UN1001 or PSYC UN1010, or the equivalent. Optimal preparation will include some background in experimental design and statistics. Memory and executive processing are critical cognitive functions required for successfully navigating everyday life. In lifespan studies, both exhibit relatively long developmental trajectories followed by stasis and then relative decline in old age. Yet, neither memory nor executive function is a unitary construct. Rather, each is comprised of separable components that may show different developmental trajectories and declines or maintenance at older ages. Moreover, memory is malleable and is a reconstruction of past experience, not an exact reproduction. We will discuss a range of topics related to the development, maintenance and potential decline in memory and executive function from infancy through old age.

Our human experience is rich: the thrill of falling in love, the spark of a new idea, the zing of table salt, the sharpness of pain. For thousands of years, philosophers, artists, and religious scholars have tried to explain our subjective experience. More recently, neuroscientists and artificial intelligence experts have contributed to this discussion, weighing in on whether we are “more than meat” (as Descartes famously put it), and whether computers can ever be sentient. In this class, we will begin with the big questions and an interdisciplinary overview of consciousness, then delve into psychology’s role. Using literature from perception, memory, emotion, metacognition, attention, and symbolic development, among other areas of psychology, we will see what empirical evidence can tell us about who we are, what we are able to know, and why we even have an experience of the world at all Spring 2022: PSYC GU4224 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment PSYC 4224 001/11056 W 2:10pm - 4:00pm 200c Schermerhorn Hall Nora Isacoff 4.00 11/12 Fall 2022: PSYC GU4224 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment PSYC 4224 001/10047 W 2:10pm - 4:00pm 200c Schermerhorn Hall Nora Isacoff 4.00 13/12 PSYC GU4225 CONSCIOUSNESS ＆ ATTENTION. 4.00 points. Prerequisites: the instructor's permission; some basic knowledge of cognitive science and neuroanatomy is desirable, but not necessary. Modern theories attempt to characterize the human mind in terms of information processing. But machines that process information do not seem to feel anything; a computer may for instance receive inputs from a video camera, yet it would be hard to imagine that it sees or experiences the vividness of colors like we do. Nobody has yet provided a convincing theory as to how to explain the subjective nature of our mental lives in objective physical terms. This is called the problem of consciousness, and is generally considered to be one of the last unsolved puzzles in science. Philosophers even debate whether there could be a solution to this problem at all. Students in this course may be recruited for participation in a voluntary research study.

Course overview: Research on autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, is highly multi-disciplinary, because it is a behaviorally defined disorder known to depend strongly on genetics. We will explore the nature of ASD by examining studies in genetics, epidemiology, neurobiology and behavior. We will examine the results from neurobiological experiments on animal models of ASD at the behavioral, systems, cellular, molecular and genetic levels. Questions to be considered will include: Is ASD really a single disorder? Which theories of ASD causation are the most compelling? Has there really been a rise in ASD prevalence? What makes a good animal model of ASD? Can neurobiological experiments on animals lead to treatments for ASD? Can any oddities of animal behaviors be considered directly analogous to those comprising a human behavioral disorder? Will the future bring “personalized medicine” with dedicated animal or human stem cell models for every person with ASD? What types of environmental insult contribute to ASD? What are the links between the immune and nervous systems in ASD? How do current behavioral findings from people with ASD direct neurobiological research?
