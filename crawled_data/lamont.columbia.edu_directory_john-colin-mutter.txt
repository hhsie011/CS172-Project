He teaches a course on the sub ject with his colleague Sonali Deraniyagala, an economist from University College London. Together they are completing a shot on Disasters and Development. He also examines these questions through the lens of human rights, asking whether rights attainment can predict disaster outcomes, such as the response to Cyclone Nargis in Myanmar, and how the norms and principals of human rights can provide guidance for climate adaptation strategies. He is author most recently of Climate Change Science: A primer for sustainable development (Columbia University Press, 2020) Education BSc Melbourne University, physics/pure mathematics MSC Geophysics Sydney University PhD Columbia University (Advise Manik Talwani) Honors & Awards Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Professor, Marine Geology and Geophysics; Professor; Professor Areas of Expertise natural disasters Climate science sustainable development equity marine geophysics Contact Info 1433 International Affairs Building New York, NY 10027 USA 212 854 0716 [email protected] http://www.columbia.edu/itc/ldeo/earthsci/webpage/webpage/jd003/index.html Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory61 Route 9W · Palisades, NY 10964 Phone 845-359-2900 Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
