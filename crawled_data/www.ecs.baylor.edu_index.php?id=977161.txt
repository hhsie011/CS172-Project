Your advisor may ask you to have a conversation with your instructor or submit additional paperwork before approving the drop, so please allow 2-3 business days for your form to be reviewed and processed. When your form is approved, you will receive an automated e-mail indicating you have a 72-hour window to drop the approved course through Bearweb. (Note that this window of time may be shorter if your form is approved less than 72 hours before the drop deadline.) ECS academic advisors are available to discuss questions related to drops during Walk-in Hours. You are also encourage to browse the FAQs below. Frequently Asked Questions When should I consider dropping a course? If you know your grade in the class and have calculated that there is little to no chance of passing, you may want to consider dropping it. Review the policies in the ECS Course Drop Request Form and have a conversation with your advisor to ensure you have exhausted all your options and know all potential consequences of the drop. If you plan to change your major and are enrolled in a course that will not count toward your new major, talk with your new advisor about the pros/cons of dropping the class. What does a 'W' mean on my transcript? A ‘W’ stands for ‘Withdraw’ and will have no impact on your GPA. If you have a ‘W’ notation assigned for a course and need to retake it for degree credit, you must retake that course at Baylor. As long as a ‘W’ does not appear on your transcript consistently (more than 2-3 times over your time at Baylor), it is typically not a red flag to employers or graduate/professional schools, especially if the dropped course is outside of your major. Note that a ‘W’ notation does count as an attempt within Baylor's Undergraduate Course Repeat Policy and the ECS Course Repeat Policy. Can I drop below 12 hours (full-time status)? Possibly, but only if you are approved to do so by the appropriate offices at Baylor. There may be paperwork to fill out, so allow at least 2-3 business days if you need to consider this option. See the first page of the ECS Course Drop Request Form for more information. There are also a few courses that can be added after the Add Deadline that you may be eligible to take. Talk to your advisor about these options.
