Curated by Bat Ami Rivlin ’19. A Space To Fill is an exhibition featured the works of seven contemporary artists who examine the spatial qualities within political, cultural, domestic, and public realities. All seven artists develop visual language within different systems of representation, relating their artistic practices to cultural systems that are meant to occupy, serve, police, or manage environments and their occupants. A Space To Fill is thus an investigation of visual strategies, interested in elements of material performativity within differently constructed spaces.
