It was established in the early 1960s as the original data center for political and social science at Harvard University. Over the years HMDC has evolved into the information technology service provider for social science research and education across many departments, centers, and research projects in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and other schools at Harvard. HMDC offers advanced computing facilities and infrastructure, including powerful and yet easy-to-use research computing tools, cluster computing, application and server hosting, and on-site computer labs. We offer statistical workshops/classes, user-friendly desktop support, and we continue to serve as the principal distributor of social science data for Harvard and MIT. Our mission at HMDC is to develop and provide world-class research computing resources, data services, and supporting information technologies to further social science research and education.
