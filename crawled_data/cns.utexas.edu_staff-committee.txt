Three main areas were identified - Communication, Education/Training, and Morale/Culture. A document was drafted by the task force identifying the problems and suggesting solutions. That document can be viewed here. One of the recommendations was the formation of a permanent staff committee for the College of Natural Sciences. Some of the members of the task force went on to form that committee along with other volunteers.
