You can also consult with your liaison librarian for help in embedding these literacies into assignments and courses. Contact your liaison librarian or fill out the form below, and a librarian will be in contact with you to determine topics and learning outcomes to meet your needs. Instruction Options Libraries constantly evolve to meet the needs of our ever changing world. We are here to provide instruction and can do so two ways, synchronously and asynchronously. Instruction can be customized to fit any lesson, from 10 minutes to entire class sessions. Synchronous Synchronous instruction is what you probably think of when you picture library instruction, real-time instruction most likely during class time. Depending on safety regulations, this may be in person or online through Zoom or WebEx. Asynchronous Asynchronous instruction makes use of tutorials, videos and other digital learning objects where students can participate on their own time through Canvas. These can be graded, for extra help or more generally tailored to your needs.
