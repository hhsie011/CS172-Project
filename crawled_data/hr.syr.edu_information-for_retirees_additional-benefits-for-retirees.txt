Syracuse University Identification Cards Link As a retiree, your Syracuse University I.D. card gives you access to the University library (library checkout privileges and remote access privileges are available to those with emeritus status), recreation facilities, Kimmel computer lab, and the campus bus service. Your Syracuse University I.D. card also enables you to obtain a discount on purchases at the Syracuse University Bookstore, and a discount on season tickets for athletic events. Retirees who wish to use the Kimmel computer lab must have an active NetID and Password. Please visit the ITS webpage for further details. In addition, a retiree’s spouse/domestic partner and dependents may also apply for an I.D. card, for which a small processing fee will apply. If your current Syracuse University I.D. card was issued prior to fall 1990, you are encouraged to obtain a new encoded I.D. card free of charge. For a replacement, please visit the ID Card Service Center located in Steele Hall, room 206.
