In cases where a student is found responsible for academic misconduct, students are given sanctions. Sanctions can affect a student's disciplinary status at Georgia Tech, could require educational activities to help them grow from the situation, and can impact their grade on the assignment and/or in the class where the violation took place. More information can be found on the Academic Sanction Guideline and on our Sanctions page. How Does the Non-Academic Misconduct Process Begin? Who Can Hear My Case? What Can I Do To Prepare?
