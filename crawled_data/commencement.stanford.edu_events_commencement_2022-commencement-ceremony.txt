Accessibility Information Disability Parking The Track House Lot (Lot 6), located via Galvez Street will be reserved for guests displaying any state-issued or temporary disability parking permit. Individuals with mobility limitations can be dropped off closer to the Stadium (near Nelson Road), once inside the Track House Lot. Additional disability parking is located in the Galvez Lot, directly across the Track House Lot on Galvez Street. Accessible Entrance While all gate entrances to the Stadium are accessible, we recommend that guests with mobility limitations use the Gate 4 entrance after parking in the Track House Lot. Once through the gate, continue through the tunnel (step-free path) to the concourse level and lower bowl sections. An elevator is located at Gate 4 and Gate 5 to access the upper bowl sections. Mobility Assistance A limited number of ushers with wheelchairs will be available, beginning at 7:30 a.m., outside Gate 4 of the Stadium to assist in escorting guests with limited mobility into the Stadium. The ushers will drop the guest off near the disability seating and return at the end of the ceremony. No advanced registration is required for this service, and the wheelchair escort service will continue throughout the entire Stadium ceremony. Seating The majority of seating at the stadium will be in direct sunlight. Umbrellas will not be allowed. Some seating areas on the east and southeast sides of the stadium will be fully or partially shaded during the ceremony. Wheelchair seating is located at the concourse level, Row Y (via the tunnels) and is in full shade. Additional wheelchair seating is located in the upper bowl, Row V (via the elevator). In order to accommodate guests using wheelchairs, or those with other disability-related needs, we request only one companion per seat. A mobility section, located in Row W and X in the lower section is available for individuals who can only climb limited stairs (5-7 steps with a handrail) or who cannot sit in the sun. All seating is first come, first served.
