Certificates lead to a Columbia University approved credential. All students enrolled in the two-year Columbia MPH are required to fulfill the course requirements of their Certificate program in addition to Core and Departmental requirements to graduate. The 20+ available Certificate programs in public health have been developed in consultation with industry employers and other key stakeholders to reflect today’s most sought-after knowledge and skillsets. Many Certificates focus on interdisciplinary topics such as global health, chronic disease, or aging, while some offer an advanced training in one particular area such as biostatistics or research methods. Most Certificate-related coursework takes place from the second to fourth semesters. However, some Certificate-specific, non-credit sessions and special events are held during the first and second semesters. Please visit the individual public health certificate pages to view some of the sample courses offered for the Certificate. To view the current course requirements, download the list of required courses and electives via the MPH Requirements Database. Applying to a Certificate & Admissions Requirements Most students apply to a Certificate as part of the process for applying to the School. Students interested in declaring or switching Certificates after matriculation should note the following: Most Certificates are open to students across the School. However, Certificate switches are not guaranteed after the Fall semester Open-Enrollment period has concluded. Some have admissions requirements related to prior coursework or test scores. Students can refer to the individual webpages (to the left) for each Certificate to learn more about the specific admissions criteria. Additionally, some Certificates have financial and academic implications. All application decisions are made by Certificate faculty leads and hosting departments. Application Period: Fall 2021 For questions, please contact the Office of Educational Initiatives at msph-oei [at] cumc.columbia.edu. Advising/Contact Each Certificate in public health is directed by a lead faculty member, with the support of departmental academic coordinators and the Office of Educational Initiatives. Students should meet with faculty leads for guidance related to academic pursuits and progress, and contact departmental coordinators and staff in the Office of Educational Programs for general information on Certificate programs. Visit the MPH Requirements Database for more information about courses, scheduling, and contacts. The Certificate courses are included within the flat tuition model.
