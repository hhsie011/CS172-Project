There is a new process that no longer requires students to visit a financial aid office to obtain a copy of their Institutional Student Information Report (ISIR) and a GRE Fee Reduction Certificate. Instead, students will be required to send a copy of their Student Aid Report (SAR) and a completed GRE Fee Reduction Request Form to ETS. Students who meet the need-based guidelines will receive a GRE Fee Reduction voucher to take the General Test and/or a Subject Test for 50 percent of the full test fee. Please visit the the GRE website for more information about the program and the new process. If you have any questions, please contact GRE Institutional Services at GRE_Fee_Reduction@ets.org or 1-609-771-7092.
