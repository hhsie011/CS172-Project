As a Ph.D. student, I examined the impacts of species invasions on plant diversity at local and global scales, while as a postdoc, I explored how biodiversity has changed on oceanic islands around the world as a consequence of species invasions. At Brown, I have continued to investigate the impact of species invasions, but most of my research effort is now aimed at understanding species extinction dynamics, species responses to climate change, and climate adaptation strategies that can conserve natural resources.

Full Text Research Research Overview My research examines how species invasions and climate change impact native species and ecosystems. I am particularly interested in understanding when species extinctions are likely and what strategies we can take to prevent them from occurring. To investigate these issues I conduct local-scale ecological research and biogeographic synthesis of regional and global patterns. I have also worked with collaborators to model species responses to climate change and to collect paleo-ecological data that informs our understanding of extinction dynamics over longer time periods. My aim is to improve our understanding of ecological systems so that we can inform natural resource policy and management.
