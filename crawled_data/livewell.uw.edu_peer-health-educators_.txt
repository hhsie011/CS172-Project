Event Calendar Gratitude Postcards AY20-21 Archives Home Livewell Peer Health Educators Peer Health Educators are current undergraduate and graduate students at UW-Seattle who facilitate peer-to-peer dialogue and learning on a variety of health and wellness topics aimed at promoting life-long behaviors that support health, self-growth, and meaningful connection. PHEs receive in-depth training and work closely with LiveWell staff as they grow their competencies and skills in health promotion and prevention work. The workshops that Peer Health Educators facilitate are interactive, engaging, and meant to promote learning and dialogue amongst students in a peer-driven setting. Workshops can be requested for UW students by anyone- faculty, staff, students, registered student organizations, departments, etc. If you are interested in becoming a Peer Health Educator, please follow us on social media to be alerted of our next hiring cycle.
