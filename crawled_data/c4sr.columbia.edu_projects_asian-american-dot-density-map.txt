Asian Americans are highly visible on national maps, but almost always as an uniform group represented by 1 color. The Asian American Dot Density map represents each Asian American as 1 dot color coded by 21 different racial groups found in Census data. The map reveals the complex spatial dynamics of specific asian racial groups in places across the country. I will update this project with 2020 data as soon as it becomes available.
