What is the most current and useful research on ice sheet and sea level rise trends, and what are the near term implications for coastal property? How will these trends affect returns, creating both risks and opportunities for investors and business leaders? This forum—a joint effort by the Tamer Center for Social Enterprise and the Paul Milstein Center for Real Estate at Columbia Business School, and the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory—brings together climate scientists and business leaders to understand how new advances in climate science can inform investments in specific sectors of the global economy. The forum explores topics that address the value and opportunity of using a science-based approach to inform and guide business and investment decisions.
