This planning can include securing specialized facilities, or budgeting for specific equipment, supplies, tailored services, or specialized personnel. Now is also the time to be thinking about what, if any, symposia or conferences the scientific team may wish to attend to disseminate the results of their research. Including travel costs in a sponsored budget can reduce administrative complications in travel procurement during the project execution. Roles Principal Investigators (PIs) are responsible for identifying and securing facilities and resources needed to conduct their research programs and projects. Department research administrators can assist investigators by maintaining template documentation regarding facilities and resources available in their departments. The Office of Sponsored Programs is available to assist researchers, their teams, and department research administrators interpreting sponsor requirements related to facilities and resources in proposals. Plan/Act Review and confirm all sponsor requirements related to identification and availability of facilities and resources prior to submitting the final application. Specialized training or approvals may be required to use certain facilities or resources. Identify university policies, procedures, training or access requirements. Ensure proposed personnel are eligible and qualified for needed approvals in the Plan/Propose stage. If your research will require the space or expertise of another researcher, be sure to have their support in writing to include in your proposal documentation. Sponsors may have specific requirements for documenting expertise and commitment. In some cases, facility access will require protocol review and approval by a regulatory department or entity. Identify these requirements early to prevent delays later in the process. Space Documenting space available to conduct your research will include descriptions of the area available for the proposed activities. This may include laboratory space, clinical space, capacity and access to animal facilities, computer equipment for data collection and analysis, as well as office resources available to the team and administration. If you are applying for externally funded research it will be critical to review sponsor requirements related to space commitments. Additionally, the use of space not under the direction of the research team may require letters of assurance or commitment. Equipment Identifying equipment needed to complete the aims of the project is another important step in the Plan/Propose stage and another area where it will be important to review sponsor requirements. Equipment as well as space not under the direction of the proposed research team may require assurances. Or, if equipment will be purchased, this is the time to plan for this expense by building it into the proposed budget. Services (+sIRB) Some research types will require contracted services; these may be services from the University, or externally contracted services ranging from data storage and analysis, compound screening, to single Institutional Review Board (sIRB) review. Engagement with service providers may require coordination both with contractor and sponsor, as the use or dissemination of contracted services may have different cost structures or requirements depending on the source of research funding. Animal Research Considerations The following are some topics to consider when planning for the use of animals in research: The species and number of animals Bio safety level Any specialized equipment or housing Note: you must contact the Department of Comparative Medicine (DCM) or the Washington National Primate Research Center (WaNPRC) to determine the availability of suitable space. The Office of Animal Welfare (OAW) can facilitate the conversation. Environmental Health and Safety Considerations Use the UWF Design Standards, including the EH&S Design Standards to determine if the proposed lab space is safety compliant. Determine the need for lab safety equipment, such as: Fire and life safety equipment, such as fire extinguishers and flammable storage Fume Hoods (consult with EH&S if purchasing new) Biological Safety Cabinets (consult with EH&S if purchasing new) Emergency Washing Equipment Radiation detection equipment and radiation shielding (consult with EH&S for Radiation Safety) Review Section 4 of the UW Laboratory Safety Manual for a list of lab safety equipment Other Resources Specialty or non-standard resources are a part of nearly every research project and may include one or more of many shared university cores or facilities. Sponsors will have unique definitions and requirements for describing the quality of the resources, and what access the team will have to the resource during the project period.
