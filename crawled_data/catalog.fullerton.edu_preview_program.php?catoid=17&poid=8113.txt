Students seeking a degree in Engineering have been provided exceptions from some of the General Education requirements. For this reason, it is important that students take the approved G.E. courses for Engineering majors that are found in their Titan Degree Audit (TDA). Additionally, they should confirm the G.E. courses that are required within their specific programs with their respective advisers. Upper-Division Writing Requirement Completing both of the following courses fulfills the upper-division English writing requirement: EGCP 441 - Advanced Electronics for Computer Engineers (4) EGCP 471 - Multidisciplinary Projects in Computer Engineering - II (2) Additional Information Written work for the two courses must meet professional standards. Both courses must be passed with a “C” (2.0) or better to satisfy the writing requirement.
