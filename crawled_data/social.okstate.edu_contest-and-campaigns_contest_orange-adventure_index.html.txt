Not too small. Just right. Oklahoma State University is America’s Brightest Orange, and we want to see how members of the Cowboy Family across the state, nation and world are repping their favorite university throughout the summer. Cowboy Family members are invited to share their Orange Adventures with us by using the hashtag #OrangeAdventure. Every Friday throughout the duration of the contest, we will select a photo to be featured on Oklahoma State’s social media accounts.
