And Yale’s alumni, parents, and friends have played a big role in making it all possible. This is just a small selection of moments in which Yale has changed the world and donors have changed Yale. 1701 Founded in a Scholarly Tradition Yale is founded in Saybrook, CT, as the Collegiate School, to educate students for “Publick employment both in Church and Civil State.” The school moved to New Haven in 1716 and was renamed Yale College in recognition of Elihu Yale’s 1718 donation of books and goods. 1714 Newtonian Physics Isaac Newton gives the library of the Collegiate School copies of his recently published Principia Mathematica (second edition, 1713) and Optice (1706), making Yale a repository of scientific thought for the colonies. 1732 First Yale Scholarship The Rev. George Berkeley establishes the first scholarship fund in Yale College, along with America’s first fellowship fund for graduate study. 1774 – 1789 History Makers Twenty-five Yale graduates serve in the Continental Congress.
