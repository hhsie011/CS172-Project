Begin Your Application GPA Requirements Syracuse Abroad Centers Syracuse Abroad centers, extensions of the Syracuse University campus, are widely recognized for their focus on student success, the quality of their academic and cultural programming, and their innovative experiential learning opportunities. A 2.5 GPA (on a 4.0 scale) is required for admission to most Syracuse Abroad centers. For some limited-enrollment programs (such as drama or design in London), the minimum GPA may be higher than 2.5, and priority enrollment may be given to those with a GPA of at least 2.75. Local Universities Some center programs require or offer the option of enrolling at a local partner university. A 3.0 minimum GPA is required for enrollment in programs with a local university course component. World Partner Affiliated Programs For most World Partner programs, the required GPA is 3.0, based on the program’s published GPA requirements and/or Syracuse Abroad’s evaluation of the program’s academic expectations. There are some World Partner programs whose GPA requirement ranges from 2.5 to 3.3. Please refer to each program’s page for its exact requirements. Most programs require an academic recommendation letter. Note: Syracuse Abroad reserves the right to adjust the requirements for World Partner programs as it deems appropriate.
