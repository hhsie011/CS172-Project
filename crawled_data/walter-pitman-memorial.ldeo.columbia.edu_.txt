Immediately he realized that this pattern was the recording of a series of reversals in the polarity of Earth's magnetic field reaching back more than 10 million years. His calculation that the ocean floor along the ridge had been widening at a rate of 4.5 centimeters per year provided overwhelming proof of the hypothesis of seafloor spreading. His publication of these results with his advisor, James Heirtzler, in the journal Science provided the spark that ignited the revolutionary paradigm of plate tectonics.
