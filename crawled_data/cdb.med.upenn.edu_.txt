An Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Committee, consisting of members of Department Faculty, Postdoctoral Fellows, Graduate Students, and Staff, is guiding our efforts to understand and address the interpersonal and structural biases within our Department, and to proactively remove barriers and create educational and professional opportunities for people underrepresented in science. We encourage you to read about the EDI Committee’s mission, and to learn more about its members and activities.

Her research is highlighted in this Forbes magazine article. Penn researchers uncover epigenetic drivers for Alzheimer’s disease September 29, 2020 Research led by by Raffaella Nativio, former research associate in the Berger Lab, Shelley Berger, Daniel S Och Professor and director of the Epigenetics Institute, and Nancy Bonini, professor of Biology, suggest that late-onset Alzheimer’s Disease is driven by epigenetic Pregnancy Complications in Assisted Reproduction Linked to a Specific Process June 9, 2020 An experimental study from researchers in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania links a specific procedure – embryo culture – that is part of the assisted reproduction process (ART) to placental abnormalities, risk for preeclampsia, and New Liver Cancer Research Targets Non-Cancer Cells to Blunt Tumor Growth May 20, 2020 “Senotherapy,” a treatment that uses small molecule drugs to target “senescent” cells, or those cells that no longer undergo cell division, blunts liver tumor progression in animal models according to new research from a team led by Celeste Simon, PhD. How “Pioneer” Protein Turns Stem Cells into Organs April 2, 2020 Penn study uncovers key mechanisms behind embryonic development, moving the regenerative medicine field closer to developing cell therapies.
