No applications will be reviewed prior to this date. The need for an Assistance Animal due to disability must be identified by a qualified professional and approved through Accessibility Resources. A request to have an Assistance Animal within University of Cincinnati owned and operated housing is considered a request for an accommodation and will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. A diagnosis or medical provider recommendation alone does not guarantee the request will be approved. The Accessibility Resources staff considers the nature of the condition’s symptoms and all available accommodations and supports when making final decisions and recommendations. Accessibility Resources reserves the right to request additional documentation when making a determination. If you need assistance in completing this form or require accommodations to do so, please contact Accessibility Resources 513-556-6823 or email accessresources@uc.edu.
