Accessibility and Special Needs Guest Drop-Off and Handicap Parking All guest drop-off and pick-up is at the intersection of Techwood Drive and Bobby Dodd Way. Guests with a valid handicap parking tag may park on Brittain Drive and Fowler Street, located next to Peters Parking Deck. Wheelchairs Wheelchairs will not be available at the venue. For those requiring a wheelchair, we suggest a private rental from one of these companies: Complete Home Medical Equipment, 404.292.6525 Accucare Medical Equipment, 770.512.0090 Enterprise Medical Services, 770.788.1505 or 866.607.1612 Accessible Seating for Guests with Disabilities and Limited Mobility ADA seating is available on a first-come, first-served basis. The area where ADA seating is located can be found on the seating maps for each ceremony on the Venue and Ceremony page. Due to high demand, this area is strictly reserved for our ADA patrons plus one companion. For guests requiring a wheelchair spot, you and your companion will be assigned a seat. Students must indicate on their RSVP they have a guest in a wheelchair to receive a wheelchair spot. Strollers Strollers are not allowed into Bobby Dodd Stadium. Bag valet is located across the street from Gate 6 on the top of Peters Parking Deck if guests wish to check in their stroller (car seat carriers may also be checked in too).
