Texas Tech University Directory Raiderlink A-Z Index Office of the Dean of Students Menu Search TTU Dean of Students Responsible Community Living Texas Tech University enrolls more than 30,000 students and continues to grow. The majority of these students, more than 23,000, live off campus. While some may be geographically distant from the main campus, the majority of these off campus students choose to live in the Lubbock community. They represent approximately 10% of the population of Lubbock and as homeowners, renters and consumers have a substantial impact on the local economy. Students are likely to choose to live off campus at some point while pursuing an education at Texas Tech. This website highlights important information regarding the off campus living experience. I hope this will be a valuable resource for students who choose to reside in the Lubbock community. Living off campus provides ample opportunities for personal growth and development. It encourages students to develop independent living skills and responsible citizenship. For many students, living off campus while at Texas Tech represents a significant transition from their previous living arrangements. In preparation for these new opportunities, consider the following: Do your research. Every town/city/municipality has ordinances and expectations for both home owners and renters and Lubbock is no exception. Thoroughly research the relevant city ordinances and plan accordingly. Carefully consider the type of living arrangements that will best meet your needs. Do your best to be a good neighbor. Although there are many predominantly student apartment complexes available in the Lubbock community, many students choose to live in single family dwellings in residential neighborhoods. Treat your neighbors as you would like to be treated. Be a good and considerate neighbor! Be an informed consumer. Don't sign a lease agreement without consulting a parent, guardian or trusted advisor. Student Legal Services at Texas Tech can also provide students with invaluable legal advice regarding leases. Be mindful as an adult, you can be legally liable for such agreements once signed. Personal financial management can be challenging. Texas Tech offers the highly regarded "Red to Black" Program for personal financial management and students are encouraged to take advantage of its excellent resources. CashCourse (www.cashcourse.org/ttu) is a free on-line financial management resource for students. Among its many resources is a calculator to assist students in comparing the costs of living on or off campus. In a financial crisis, the Red Raider Relief Fund in the Office of Parent and Family Relations offers emergency funds to eligible students. Consider the logistics of living off campus. Off campus living will present students with a number of opportunities for logistical problem-solving. Many apartment complexes include some or all utilities in their lease agreement, but some do not. Single family homes in residential neighborhoods will often require students to make their own arrangements for utilities. Renting a single family dwelling may make tenants responsible for lawn care and minor home maintenance. Renters must consider the availability of convenient, safe and secure parking for themselves and their guests. Depending on location, transportation may be a new consideration for students. Consider how your distance from the campus will impact your daily schedule and plan accordingly. Provide updated mailing address information to the Postal Service as well as to the University (www.raiderlink.ttu.edu). Consider your safety. Become familiar with the neighborhood where you are considering living. Once you've moved in, continue to familiarize yourself with the neighborhood. Keep emergency numbers handy. Know when to use 911 to obtain assistance. Consider your personal health. Important aspects of student success are physical and emotional well-being. The University offers various programs and services to promote student wellness. Students have access to both Student Health Services and the Student Counseling Center should those services be needed. The Student Recreation Center provides a variety of physical fitness and relaxation activities and programs. Commuter meal plans are available from Hospitality Services for those living off campus and offer nutritious meals while on campus. The campus is designed to provide students with an engaging environment that supports their educational and personal success. Students who live off campus need to make a conscious effort to remain connected to and actively involved in the campus community. Whether students live on campus or off campus, they are part of the Red Raider family!
