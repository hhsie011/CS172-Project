Please note, it is not necessary to complete pre-requisites at Columbia University. Students are expected to meet pre-requisite requirements prior to registration. Chemistry S1403 and S1404 may be counted toward the science requirement for most Columbia University undergraduates. The sequence Chemistry S2443, S2444, and S2543 meets the minimum requirement in organic chemistry for admission to medical school. Consult your premed adviser. Lab fees, paid at the time of registration, cover the costs of nonreturnable items, chemicals, and reasonable breakage. In addition, students may be charged for excessive breakage, returning equipment uncleaned, or late check-out. Students must present lab fee receipt at the first laboratory meeting.

The contribution of chemistry to everyday life is immense. The applications of chemistry in medicine, petrochemicals, cosmetics, and fertilizers are readily apparent. However, the knowledge and applications of chemistry come in handy in many other fascinating fields, some of which may be less than obvious. Examples of areas in which chemistry plays a key role include forensic science; art restoration and forgery detection; and flavors and fragrances in food, beverages and other consumer products. The goal of this course is to provide insights and spur discussion of several areas and applications of chemistry, while gaining hands-on experience in techniques used in these fields.
