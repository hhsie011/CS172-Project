Why did you get involved in your local chapter?: I got involved with the San Diego Chapter because we had recently moved to the area and wanted to meet other alumni at a football game watch. What are your local favorites?: Here in San Diego a few of my favorites are Balboa Park, any beach, Granite Lion Cellars winery out in Jamul, and kayaking in Mission Bay. Fun Fact: A fun fact is that I studied abroad in Paris. I lived in my own place and had a blast!
