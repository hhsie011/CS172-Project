Up to two courses of the eight required for the master's degree may be completed while the student is an undergraduate, but at least six semester courses must be taken while in residence. Students must apply for this program before they complete their undergraduate studies. (They do so through the Graduate School's online application system.) Admission must be approved by the department in which the master's degree is sought and by the Graduate School. While a student must be enrolled as an active undergraduate student at the time of application, admission to the graduate program can be deferred for up to two years with approval of the department. APPLICATION All admission decisions for graduate programs are made at the program level. Rising juniors and seniors who are interested in pursuing a Fifth-Year Master’s should contact faculty in their intended programs. Students must apply online before graduation, but may defer their admission for up to two years. Applicants are not required to take the GRE. There is no application fee for fifth-year applicants. FINANCIAL AID Undergraduate financial-aid awards do not extend into graduate school. Some programs and centers offer financial support to their Fifth-Year Master’s students. Please contact your intended program for details.
