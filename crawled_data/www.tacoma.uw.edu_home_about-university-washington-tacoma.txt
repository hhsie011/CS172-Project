Community UW Tacoma is an urban-serving university, closely linked with Tacoma and the South Puget Sound. We're a member of the Coalition of Urban Serving Universities, a network of public, urban, research universities committed to creating an educated workforce, building strong communities and improving the health of diverse populations. Land Acknowledgement The UW Tacoma community acknowledges that we learn, teach, work and live on the ancestral land of the Coast Salish people. In particular, our campus is situated on traditional lands of the Puyallup Tribe of Indians. We recognize that this is a difficult and painful history, and we understand we must play an active role in remembering, not just what happened to Indigenous communities; post settlement, but also the rich history that existed long before colonization. This land acknowledgement is one small act in an ongoing process of honoring the past while working together with local Tribes to build a more inclusive and thoughtful community. The UW Connection Created in 1990, UW Tacoma is one of three campuses that make up the University of Washington, which was founded in 1861. Each campus shares a dedication to excellence, the same faculty hiring standards and high standards of social responsibility while offering their own different educational experiences.
