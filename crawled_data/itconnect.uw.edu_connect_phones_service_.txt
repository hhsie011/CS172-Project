Contact UW-IT About UW-IT Campus Phones On This Page Phone Descriptions Phone Models Quick Reference Guides and Instructional Videos Repair Procedures Ordering Procedures (Moves, Adds, and Changes) Phone Descriptions There are several phone models found across campus. Although each have similar capabilities, each have a different look and feel. The standard multi-button phones are the Avaya 9611G, J179, and the 9608. These phones are Voice over IP (VoIP) and require minimum network standards to be met before they are installed. In addition, there is an option for a softphone which is an application installed on your desktop computer or notebook. Other phone models are digital and analog. Digital sets are used in locations that do not meet the minimum network requirements to support VoIP. Analog service for desktop phones is being phased out due to higher infrastructure costs, but will still be available for devices like fax machines, modems, and credit card machines.
