Why did you get involved in your local chapter?: When you are far from campus, it feels good to make contact with others who have the same value system and shared memories. There is also a shared purpose working with other alumni. What are your local favorites in your city?: Ohio is a great area for golfers. So many courses, and many designed by famous architects. Cincinnati is known for its chili, Graeter's ice cream, LaRosa's pizza, its riverfront, great restaurants and bars (Arnold's is my favorite), the symphony orchestra, and Labor Day fireworks.
