Byrne Jr. Prize in Mathematics is a $35,000 fellowship that recognizes the top Dartmouth graduating mathematics major interested in continuing mathematics at the graduate level. It is expected to cover tuition for the first year of graduate studies in mathematics or a related field. The prize was established in 2019 and is awarded annually. 2022 Byrne Prize recipient: Zachary Couvillion ’22 View previous Byrne Prize recipients. Thayer Prize Exam The Thayer Mathematical Prizes are financed by the income from a fund, originally in the form of a $1000 bond, the gift of General Sylvanus Thayer of the class of 1807, of Braintree, Massachusetts. The gift was received on July 4, 1869. According to the deed of gift, in terms slightly modified by General Thayer on October 11, 1871, the principal was “to constitute a perpetual prize fund for superior proficiency in the higher branches of Mathematics.” The Mathematics Department Prize fund for this exam is up to $1000, to be distributed among the exam winners. The exam consists of Mathematics Olympiad style problems. Originality and creativity are heavily weighed. 2022 Thayer Prize winners: First Place, Matthew Coleman ’25; Second Place, Jessica Jiang ’25.

Senior Thesis Awards A student who satisfies the requirements of the College for admission to the Honors Program and is interested in doing independent work is strongly encouraged to participate in the departmental Honors Program. Students who successfully complete the Honors Program will have their degrees conferred with ‘Honors’ or ‘High Honors’ in mathematics; high honors is awarded only if the student submits a written thesis. The department awards the Hazleton Mirkil Prize prize for Best Senior Thesis Presentation. The prize is awarded at the Department’s annual barbecue, generally held in May. Due to COVID-19 restrictions we were unable to host in-person senior theses presentations in 2020 and 2021. 2021 Best Senior Thesis Presentation: Jacob Swenberg ’21 (advisor: John Voight) Fields of Moduli for QM Abelian Surfaces with CM View previous honors theses and prize recipients. Undergraduate Poster Session All undergraduates who have done research projects in pure or applied mathematics are invited to present a poster at the department’s annual Undergraduate Poster Session. The Randolph and Christine Burnley Bucklin Prize is awarded to winning posters in applied mathematics, and the William Slesnick Prize is awarded to winning posters in pure mathematics. Prizes are awarded at the Department’s annual barbecue, generally held in May. Due to COVID-19 restrictions we were unable to host in-person poster sessions in 2020 and 2021. Louisa Gao ’22 and Matt Sawicki ’20 won First Place in Applied Mathematics for their poster For Whom the Bell Tolls: Modeling Wind Chimes with the Classical Wave Equation, which won First Place in Applied Mathematics. Ethan Goldman ’22 won First Place in Pure Mathematics for his poster Continued Fractions and abc-Triples, which won First Place in Pure Mathematics.

Recipients contributed in diverse ways such as participating in student governance, serving on campus-wide committees and in the development and promotion of programs that enhance the academic and social options of the entire community. Community Award recipents in our department: 2011: Katherine Kinnaird PhD ’14 2008: Allison Henrich PhD ’08 National competitions Putnam Exam Each year the annual Putnam Competition is held on the first Saturday in December. Thousands of students from all across the United States participate in the Putnam Exam every year, as it is a wonderful way to express problem solving ability while having fun doing mathematics. Although this competition takes place at an awkward time of year for the Dartmouth calendar, Dartmouth Putnam teams have had some impressive placements, including ranking 20th nationwide in 2006, and 26th nationwide in 2011 and in 2016.
