Collectively, the Libraries provide distinctive expertise, services, and spaces that enhance teaching, learning, and research for and in collaboration with the Notre Dame community. In addition, the Libraries partner with libraries in the community, at both higher education institutions and the St. Joseph County Public Library, to provide comprehensive access to learning materials.
