Skip Navigation California State University, Fullerton Site Menu Administration and Finance Student Business Services Main Navigation Services Forms Faculty & Staff About Titan One-Stop Shop Refunds There are multiple types of refunds and different reasons to receive a disbursement. After your fees have been paid in full, an overpayment will be returned through the student's account by a check in the mail or through an enrolled direct deposit account. Credit card refunds will be returned to the credit card that made the original payment. Payments made by others on behalf of the student will be sent to the student as a refund. See below for more information. Different terms and conditions apply for EIP enrolled courses: Extension and International Program (EIP) Refund Policy TYPES OF REFUNDS Students withdrawn completely from the University during their enrolled term may be responsible for prorated mandatory fees. Percentages for prorated fees are based on the number of days of enrollment in the school term. See tables below for more information. Financial Aid Disbursements Grants, Loans, Scholarships, and other financial aid will first apply to your fees. Surplus or remaining Financial Aid will be given to you as a "refund" or disbursement after tuition, campus-based fees, and housing costs (if applicable) have been paid. Parent PLUS Loans will be disbursed to the parent, not the student. Student Business Services will only disburse your funds after your aid is approved and authorized by the Office of Financial Aid. For more information about the amount of your financial aid you may be eligible for, please contact the Office of Financial Aid at (657) 278-3125, or visit them during their office hours in GH-146. "Cash" Refunds (overpayments) Prorated Refunds (Complete Withdrawal from the University): Students who have completely withdrawn from the University during the term will receive a prorated refund of mandatory fees, including non-resident tuition fee (Proration defined by the number of days a student is enrolled in a term). There are no refunds of basic registration fees or non-resident tuition fee for students withdrawing after the 60% point in the term Partial Refunds (Full-time to Part-time): These refunds are for students that have dropped units, causing their enrollment status to change from full-time (7+ units) to part-time (0-6 units) during the campus designated drop period. Fees not Eligible for Refund No full refund of tuition and campus fees if courses are dropped during school term (See Academic Calendar for official dates) No refund of tuition and campus fees if courses are dropped after 60% point in the term.
