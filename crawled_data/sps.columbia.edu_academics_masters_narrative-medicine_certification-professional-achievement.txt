Narrative medicine enables patients and caregivers to voice their experience, to be heard, to be recognized, and to be valued, improving the delivery of healthcare. The non-degree, online Certification of Professional Achievement in Narrative Medicine prepares health professionals, writers, and scholars to apply the skills and values of narrative understanding to improve outcomes for both patients and caregivers. The program is developed specifically for students who seek ways to bring narrative methods into their current careers. The curriculum introduces students to the principles and practice of narrative medicine through rigorous courses that promote intellectual growth, interpersonal relationships, and personal insight. Students will practice designing and evaluating narrative training interventions in clinical settings. Those who complete the Certification Program gain the equivalent of six elective credits toward the Master of Science in Narrative Medicine, should they elect to continue their studies. Taught by Columbia University Narrative Medicine faculty, each course combines multimedia presentations, weekly discussions, and collaborative activities to build skills in the clinical and personal aspects of narrative medicine. Offered part-time for working professionals, the Certification of Professional Achievement in Narrative Medicine is a fully asynchronous online program. Students have the flexibility of accessing course materials, lectures, and assignments each week during times that fit their schedule. Students interact in discussion groups and forums, and participate in collaborative and independent coursework. Students are required to participate in a non-credit Narrative Medicine workshop at some point during the program. Students have access to world-class Columbia faculty as well as career and professional development resources to advance their personal and professional goals. Upon Completion, You Will...
