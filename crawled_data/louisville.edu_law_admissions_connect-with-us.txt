Once we are again able to safely welcome visitors, we would be delighted to have you join us. In the meantime, please make use of alternate means of connecting with us. Virtual Admissions Counseling Since we cannot meet with prospective students in person at this time, we are happy to offer virtual admissions counseling as an opportunity to connect one-on-one with an Office of Admissions representative to learn more about our law school and the admissions process. Counseling appointments for the Spring 2022 semester are now available for reservation on our online scheduling calendar. Virtual Tour Although we cannot currently accommodate visitors in the building, we invite you to take a virtual tour of the law school and see for yourself what Louisville Law has to offer. Office Hours The Office of Admissions is open Mondays through Fridays, from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM Eastern. If you have questions for our office that are not addressed on this website, you may call us at (502) 852-6391 or email us at lawadmissions@louisville.edu. At this time, our staff members continue to work semi-remotely. Your patience is appreciated as we work to respond to inquiries. Please note that when we are not in the office, callers will be sent to voicemail, and return calls from our staff may display as coming from a “Private Caller” on caller ID.
