By Earth Institute October 19, 2020 Every year, Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory invites families and community members to visit the campus and learn about its research through fun hands-on activities and talks. Although Open House cannot happen in person this year, you can still explore Lamont and its history-making discoveries through a game that just launched today. “Discover Lamont! A Virtual Science Adventure” is an escape room–style game that will entertain, educate, and keep everyone guessing. It takes players on a journey around the world, from the insides of the Core Repository Lab at Lamont to an Arctic station and even the middle of the ocean. You’ll learn about topics like seafloor mapping and tree-ring dating in order to break codes and solve puzzles. The game is fun for kids, families, and science enthusiasts of all ages. You can play it here. Lamont Open House at Home will also bring you four days filled with fun workshops, powerful talks and panel discussions, and explosive demonstrations. Check out our full lineup here.
