The goal of this newsletter is to highlight our diversity and inclusion efforts across campus so that you can participate in our mission to cultivate a culture of inclusion and belonging. Spring 2022 Newsletter About the OID Newsletter In the Spring of 2017, we began a periodic newsletter. The intended goal of the newsletter is to broaden our communication and continue to enhance awareness about diversity and inclusion initiatives happening in the Boston College community. The newsletter provides information about our office, including featured programs and highlights from past events. We also connect you to some other efforts at Boston College that promote diversity and inclusion. However, there is a lot more happening on campus than what we are able to show in this brief letter. Please explore our website for more resources and information about what is being done to provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for all members of the community.
