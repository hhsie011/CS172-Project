From the Owl mascot, to the Temple “T,” to the fight song, Temple pride shines. The Temple "T" Across Temple's campuses and throughout Philadelphia, the Temple “T” is the iconic symbol of the university. Designed by students in a graphic arts and design class in the Tyler School of Art in 1983, the “T” represents strength and positive character, with open ends that are symbolic of the free exchange of ideas that is the hallmark of a Temple education. The Owl To honor Temple’s beginning as a night school for ambitious young people, the nocturnal owl was adopted as its mascot. The owl represents wisdom and knowledge and is known for being perceptive, resourceful and courageous. Hooter the Owl is a part of Temple’s Spirit Squad, making appearances at football and basketball games, alumni events and more. Each February, mascots from all over the city of Philadelphia come to Temple to celebrate Hooter's birthday at a home basketball game. Alma Mater Onward with Temple, / Banners all unfurled; Wide flung our standards, / To the winds they're hurled. Following our Founder / To immortal Fame; Making true his vision, / Of a deathless name. Hail! Alma Mater, / Honor, praise to Thee; We pledge our lives, / Our hearts in loyalty. Wisdom, Truth and Virtue / Built our Temple great; Perseverance conquers; / Higher to create. "T for Temple U" T for Temple U U-ni-versity! Fight, fight, fight! For the Cherry and the White, For the Cherry and the White, We'll fight, fight, fight! The Cherry Crusade Temple’s most ardent fans, the Cherry Crusade comprises students who paint themselves in Temple colors, make signs, lead cheers, and show their fervent support for Temple Athletics in the front rows at football and basketball games. Acres of Diamonds In his famous speech “Acres of Diamonds,” Temple Founder Russell Conwell claims that greatness can be found in our own backyards. He wrote, “Greatness consists not in holding some office; greatness really consists in doing some great deed with little means, in the accomplishment of vast purposes from the private ranks of life, that is true greatness.” Temple students and alumni strive to fulfill Conwell’s wish for the university. Welcome Week Each fall, the academic school year begins with Welcome Week, which includes Temple Fest—a two-day, outdoor festival featuring music, food, giveaways and games, as well as informational booths sponsored by Temple’s student organizations, campus departments and local vendors. The week concludes with Convocation, a ceremony introducing incoming students to the Temple community and sharing the traditions of the university with the newest generation of Owls. Homecoming Each fall, students, alumni, faculty, staff and their families celebrate Homecoming Weekend by attending that weekend’s football game. And before the game, hundreds of Owls gather outside to participate in Tailgate Village. Graduates being inducted into the Gallery of Success and the Athletics Hall of Fame are also honored at special ceremonies. Learn more Alumni Weekend Temple alumni return to campus each spring to reunite and reconnect through events including the 5K Run and Family Fun Walk, reunions, the Cherry & White spring football game, an outdoor festival and much more.
