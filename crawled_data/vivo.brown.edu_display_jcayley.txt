Full Text Research Research Overview My research and practice explore the extraordinary potential for digital language art: including writing in digital media, and writing[transitive] digital media. Most recently my work engages language art and reading in aurality, transactive synthetic language, ambient poetics in programmable media, and writing in and for immersive 3D virtual reality systems, with parallel practice-based theoretical research concerning the roles of code and temporality in language art practices, the ontology and related philosophy of language, and the advent of aurature. Research Statement [ Note: when I came to revise this research statement, Jan 2020, I was surprised by how out-of-date the previous version had become. I think it best that readers form their own impression of my current research from my website, publications and the overview above, all more regularly updated. ] Scholarly Work ‘电脑生成的诗意文本与针对该文本的过程性中文翻译—源于萨缪尔·贝克特的文章《是如何》 = a Poetic Text Generated Using Computation, and a Procedural Translation Derived from This Text—Based on an Extract from Samuel Beckett’s How It Is.’ [In Chinese]. 上海文学 = Shanghai Literature, no. 480 (2017): 34-38. ‘Aurature at the End(s) of Electronic Literature.’ Electronic Book Review (2017): http://electronicbookreview.com/thread/electropoetics/aurature.
