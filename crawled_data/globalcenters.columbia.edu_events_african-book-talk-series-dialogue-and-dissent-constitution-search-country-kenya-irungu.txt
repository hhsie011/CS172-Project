With this series, we hope to offer a platform where African writers can engage a global audience, offering not just their work but exciting perspectives on how personal, political, and cultural experiences drive their storytelling. Dialogue and Dissent: A Constitution in Search of a Country Kenya is a valuable record written by an insider to the Kenyan and Africa story, reflecting a fight for a society founded on constitutional values of inclusion, equality, and social justice. Written for global audiences, it shares vivid insights and bold perspectives from some of Kenya’s boldest advocates over 2010-2020. Their stories lie in the simple choices they take daily to uphold democracy and respect human rights in a world where these conditions are rapidly diminishing. For more about the book, join us virtually on 21st July 4 PM Nairobi/9 AM New York.
