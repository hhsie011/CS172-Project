While some MMI faculty hold appointments in other graduate programs, all are active trainers in the Pathobiology Program. The Graduate program in Pathobiology trains individuals to become clinically aware basic scientists and provides the academic framework to develop the intellectual skills needed to succeed in virtually any scientific discipline. The program and its faculty integrate the practice of basic biology and medical science to understand the mechanisms of human disease initiation, progression and resolution. View the Graduate Program in Pathobiology Molecular Biology, Cell Biology & Biochemistry Graduate Program The Brown University Graduate Program in Molecular Biology, Cell Biology and Biochemistry (MCB) was organized in 1976 to bring together faculty who recognized the emergence of common conceptual and experimental aspects of investigation in biochemistry, genetics, virology, immunology, pathology, and cellular, developmental and molecular biology. It is truly an interdisciplinary, interdepartmental Program. Our Program offers students of superior ability and motivation excellent preparation for a career that includes research in biology and medical sciences. The Program is designed to provide the student with a firm background in research encompassing biochemistry and cellular, developmental and molecular biology.
