The honors program is closely tied to the pursuit of advanced research projects. Doing an undergraduate research project or thesis can significantly enhance a student’s résumé and prospects for advancement to graduate school. Because successful research projects rely on a student’s initiative, while deepening their knowledge, they often help students land key summer internships early in their undergraduate career. Students must maintain high academic standing to apply for honors, which they do after completing 60 semester hours of coursework, including at least 8 hours of upper-division coursework in geological sciences. Honors Program Minimum Requirements A University overall GPA of at least 3.00, and a GPA in geological sciences of at least 3.50. Completion of GEO 171H, 172H, and 173H with a grade of at least B. Completion of GEO 379H (honors tutorial course) with a grade of at least B. Completion at the University of at least 60 semester hours of coursework counted toward the degree.
