Our office will add the purchase price of the computer to your financial aid budget and offer a subsidized Princeton student loan to cover the cost. You may request one computer purchase budget adjustment for the purchase price of a personal computer and accessories up to $3,500 over the course of your years at Princeton. If you purchase your computer through the Student Computing Initiative (SCI), you must select the financial aid loan payment option. Your Princeton student account will be charged for the computer, and the loan will automatically be applied to cover the charge. You must make your SCI purchase before spring semester Dean's Date. If you are a senior, you must make your SCI purchase before the end of October of your senior year. If you purchase your computer through a third-party vendor, you must first purchase the computer, and then submit the receipts to the financial aid office for reimbursement. The loan will be credited to your Princeton student account. You must submit your receipts to the financial aid office by spring semester Dean's Date. If your Princeton grant was reduced to accommodate an outside scholarship, we will instead apply this amount of Princeton grant to your student account. If your reduced Princeton grant does not cover the purchase price, you may then request a subsidized loan for the difference if you wish. The combination of reduced Princeton grant and subsidized loan will not exceed $3,500.
