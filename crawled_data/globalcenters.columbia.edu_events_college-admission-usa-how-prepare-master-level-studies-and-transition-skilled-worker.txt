Hundreds of thousands of international students are admitted to U.S. educational institutions each year. According to the Institute of International Education, there were close to 42,000 students from Sub-Saharan Africa enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities in 2019. This represented 3.9% of foreign students in the U.S. Navigating the U.S. college and graduate school admissions process as an international student necessitates some preparation and planning. The variety of colleges in the U.S. gives students some flexibility and choice to find the right field of study. However, with so many requirements and deadlines, the admissions process can quickly become challenging. Prospective students and their families face concerns and questions regarding the application process, how to finance college, types of schools and programs to apply to, among other issues. Therefore, international students should learn the best ways to prepare in order to be successful. These informational webinar series are intended for students who are based in Africa and wish to apply to colleges and universities in the United States. Students and their families will get an in-depth look at the admissions process and critical requirements concerning preparing for life in the United States. The Webinar is structured as a 3-part series: Part 1: An overview of admission and education in the United States, including a section on financial aid and scholarships. [Completed] Part 1B: Master Level Studies and how to transition to a professional career. Part 2: Student life and well-being in the United States - how to cope and build connections. Part 3: Career planning and life after college.
