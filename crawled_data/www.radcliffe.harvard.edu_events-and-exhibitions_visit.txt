Radcliffe Institute activities will continue to be primarily virtual through the end of the 2021–2022 academic year. Our work has continued unabated but has been reimagined to safeguard the health and well-being of our community. Join us online for public events, explore our digital exhibitions, and read the latest news from the Institute. The Schlesinger Library’s Reading Room is open Monday through Friday from 10 AM to 4 PM. The Lia and William Poorvu Gallery is open to all visitors, Monday through Friday, 9 AM to 5 PM.
