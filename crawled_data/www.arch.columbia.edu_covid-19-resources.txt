In addition, it is strongly recommended that all affiliates follow these guidelines when engaged in social and other activities off campus, including physical distancing, face covering, and hand hygiene. How Campus Life Will Be Different The Facilities and Campus Life Working Group has established health and safety protocols for campus operations and created guidelines for use and assignment of space while COVID-19 mitigation strategies are in place. Enhanced Health and Safety Policy This document has been established to help protect individuals in the Columbia community and our neighbors as we return to campus. It outlines the expectation that all members of our community will follow specific health and hygiene practices.

Check the University Libraries page for the latest updates. COVID-19 Emergency Fund In 2020, Columbia GSAPP established a $250,000 Emergency Fund to assist current GSAPP students with unexpected expenses related to COVID-19. The fund was created by the Dean’s Office with the generous support of donors and alumni, who contributed specifically to support the student community. Two rounds of funding in the Fall 2020 semester met 100% of requests by disbursing $91,138 in October 2020 and an additional $127,654 in December 2020. Further requests for support were met throughout the Spring 2021 semester, disbursing an additional $71,951. The School expanded the original budget to provide a total of $290,743 in emergency aid to 195 students in the 2020-2021 academic year. GSAPP is extending this support by renewing the GSAPP Emergency Fund in the 2021-2022 academic year. Read more here Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) Program for GSAPP Students Given the unprecedented and unexpected continuation of the pandemic and its effect on students and campus life, Columbia GSAPP is announcing the opportunity to apply for an emergency grant paid directly to students or credited to the student account in an effort to reduce a balance owed to the University. For example, we understand many are experiencing challenges in finding work or other funding sources generally used to support items such as tuition, fees, food, housing, course materials, technology, health care (including mental), and child care or other educationally related expenses. Funding will be from the Higher Education Emergency Relief Funds (HEERF), and priority will be given to students who exhibit exceptional need. Read more about the HEERF Program In the University Life series of Student Voices, GSAPP student Ochuko Okor explains why following the Columbia Community Health Compact is so important to the well-being of our entire community. You can hear additional Student Voices on #KeeptheCompact.
