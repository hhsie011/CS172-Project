Request reproductions of library materials for research or publication. Harvard Library offers the ability to request copies of library materials for research or publication. Requests for copies are considered on a case-by-case basis. Our ability to fulfill your request may depend on the policies of the library that holds the material, the condition of the material, copyright, or donor restrictions. Submitting Requests There are three ways to initiate a reproduction request. All require you to have a HOLLIS Special Request account. You do not need to be affiliated with Harvard to create an account. Log into your HOLLIS Special Request account or create a new account here.

Tool HOLLIS for Archival Discovery Catalog for exploring collection guides, finding aids and inventories to locate unique materials in Harvard's special collections and archives. Reproduction Pricing Pricing for reproductions varies based on the characteristics of the source material and the quality of reproduction requested. Many libraries are able to provide quick reference scans of a few pages at no cost. If, however, the original material cannot be digitized by the library, or if very high-quality scans are necessary for publication, the request will be forwarded to Harvard Library’s Imaging Services department. Pricing estimates for reproductions created by Imaging Services are available here. You will be contacted with a quote before your request is processed and pre-payment is required for all orders. Contact Us If you have questions about requesting reproductions you can contact the library that holds the materials (view full list of libraries) or you can contact Imaging Services at 617-495-3995 or via email at imaging@fas.harvard.edu.
