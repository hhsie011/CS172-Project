Taking Marta To take MARTA to the Ferst Center, go to the Midtown station. Exit the station on the side opposite from 10th Street. Look for the Tech Trolley and that will take you to the Georgia Tech campus at no charge. The Trolley schedule changes by day and time of year and has limited evening hours, so please check the schedule. Exit the Tech Trolley at the Ferst Drive & Student Center stop. Cross the street, continue towards the Ferst Center, and past the Student Center on your right for about 100 yards. To return, reverse the directions (the Trolley stop to return to MARTA is on the Ferst Center/Student Center side of the street). Again, please check the Tech Trolley schedule carefully to make sure it is running when you need it. You may also take MARTA to the North Avenue station and then order a Lyft or Uber to the Ferst Center.
