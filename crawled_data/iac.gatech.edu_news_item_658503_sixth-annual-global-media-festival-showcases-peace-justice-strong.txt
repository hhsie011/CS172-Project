Posted May 25, 2022 The annual Global Media Festival hosted by the School of Modern Languages is a critical voice for the humanities in sustainability studies at Georgia Tech. For its sixth iteration, professors across the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts organized six virtual and hybrid events from March 14 to April 19 under the theme “Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions,” corresponding to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) #16. The events featured three celebrated filmmakers and nine languages across 11 countries. More than 250 people from Atlanta and abroad attended. “The Global Media Festival helps students become global citizens by teaching them about sustainability issues across languages and cultures,” said Amanda Weiss, assistant professor of Japanese and festival director. “By introducing students to an international group of scholars, filmmakers, and artists, we explore the diverse cultural, social, and linguistic frameworks that inform sustainability issues around the world.” Read the entire story on the School of Modern Languages website.
