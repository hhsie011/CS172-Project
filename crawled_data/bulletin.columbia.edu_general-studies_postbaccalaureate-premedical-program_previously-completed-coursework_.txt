Research Opportunities Veterans Benefits and Transition Act Faculty Archived BulletinsToggle Archived Bulletins Print Options Previously Completed Coursework Admitted Students Some Postbac Premed students may have completed one or more of the prerequisite courses before matriculating in the Program. Depending on when and where such coursework was completed, and the grade(s) received, students may be advised to repeat the course or to take an advanced-level science course in order to be more competitive applicants to medical school. Quarter-term courses taken at undergraduate institutions may not represent the same number of credit hours as semester courses, and therefore may not satisfy requirements. Advisors typically have discussions with students about repeating coursework after a student has been admitted and attended a Postbac Planning Session. Current Students Once a student matriculates into the program, all subsequent required courses must be completed at Columbia University, unless an exception is made based on a petition submitted to the Premedical Committee. As there are some variations in requirements from school to school and state to state, students are advised to consult individual medical schools and healthcare programs for specific prerequisites to complete in addition to the basic premedical curriculum. Students coming from professionally-focused undergraduate schools (e.g., engineering, culinary, visual or performing arts, nursing, business, etc.) who may lack sufficient grounding in liberal arts are advised to address this deficiency through additional non-science coursework in order to be competitive candidates for medical school.
