With this series, we hope to offer a platform where African writers can engage a global audience, offering not just their work but exciting perspectives on how personal, political, and cultural experiences drive their storytelling. “Tread Brightly” discusses the ethics of orphanage tourism, cruise ships, and study abroad programs. It asks how one’s identity as a traveler-like country of origin, gender, and race impacts a travel experience. It considers the climate consequences of non-essential travel. “Tread Brightly” is for anyone who’s thinking about traveling the world, whether you are a college student who wants to make the most of a summer, a young professional who wants to explore life outside the cubicle, or a retiree who wants to go to India finally.

As you interact with the original featured essays in the book, you will learn how you can turn travel from passive consumption to an active exchange and how to impact the lives of others through your excursions.
