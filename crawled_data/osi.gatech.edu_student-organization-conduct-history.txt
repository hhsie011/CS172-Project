Student organizational disciplinary history will be posted below. Only incidents occurring after August 15, 2018 for which an organization is found responsible will be publicly shared. Records will be posted as often as monthly throughout the semester and will include each organization's name, the violation/s for which the organization was found responsible, date of occurrence, the sanction, the organization status, a short summary of the incident, and the schedule to complete the sanction. This information will help students make better informed decisions about organizations they may plan to join and provide greater transparency to the Georgia Tech community regarding disciplinary outcomes.
