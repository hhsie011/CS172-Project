Students involved in the Linkages Program focus on a wide range of areas including human rights, constitutional law, international law, and criminal law through participation in classes, meetings with professors, and workshops at universities in Buenos Aires, Santiago, São Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro. In addition, students visit government institutions, meet with national authorities, and work with local NGOs. The students from Yale visit one of the countries during the summer recess where they are hosted by students at our partner universities. The YLS students then host the Latin American students who visit Yale for 3-4 weeks at the begininning of the spring term. Only enrolled Yale Law School students are eligible to apply. The travel and living expenses of the participants are covered by the program. The Argentina and Chile programs run from mid-May to early June, and the Brazil program takes place in August. The 2020 and 2021 editions of Linkages were cancelled due to COVID-19. Professors Cristina Rodriguez, Claire Priest, Daniel Markovits, and Owen Fiss direct the program, and Brad Hayes (bradley.hayes@yale.edu) is the program coordinator.
