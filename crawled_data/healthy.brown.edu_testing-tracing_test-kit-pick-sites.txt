For routine asymptomatic testing, self-administered rapid antigen test kits — and packs of KN95 masks — are available to all Brown students, faculty and staff. Symptomatic Testing If you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 or other respiratory illness, please stay home from class and other activities and contact the appropriate health specialist as listed below. Do not go on-campus or to Brown’s test kit pick-up sites, as you may risk infecting others.

You may email nursing@health.brown.edu with non-urgent questions.
