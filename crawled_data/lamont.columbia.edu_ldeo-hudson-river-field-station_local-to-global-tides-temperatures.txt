The traditional instrumentation to conduct these measurements can be expensive to install and maintain, especially in areas with prolonged ice in the winter. This project will test small, inexpensive, and accessible instruments that will allow us to collect data more broadly through partnerships with community groups. Once tested locally at the end of Piermont Pier, the project team hopes to include the instruments in Greenland Rising, a project working with community members in Greenland to predict the coastal response to future changes in the ice sheet. Working closely with local residents in several local communities the project will examine impacts of these changes.
