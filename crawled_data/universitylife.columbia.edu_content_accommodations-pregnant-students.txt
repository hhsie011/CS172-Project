Title IX states “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance[.]” Examples of the types of discrimination that are covered under Title IX include sexual harassment and discrimination based on pregnancy and parenting. The University’s Title IX Coordinator works to ensure that Columbia’s programs and classrooms are accessible to all pregnant students. This includes students experiencing any pregnancy-related condition for which they may need accommodations, including pregnancy, fertility treatments, and medical conditions related to miscarriage or abortion. Together with the student, the student’s advisor and professors, the Title IX Coordinator arranges reasonable accommodations which enable pregnant students or students experiencing pregnancy-related conditions to participate in academic programs. Reasonable accommodations help students maintain their educational plans while not centrally altering the nature of academic programs or requirements. Commonly, reasonable accommodations may include: shifting assignment and exams dates, excusing absences for medical appointments, in some cases a medical leave of absence or taking an incomplete in a class and making up the work missed at a later date. Reasonable accommodations are assessed on a case-by-case basis by the Title IX staff and the student’s Dean of Students or other staff involved with the School’s student life, as well as through an individualized assessment of the student’s circumstances and a doctor’s valuation of what is medically necessary, and knowledge of the context in which the accommodation is sought. For all students who would like to register for a consultation on accommodations, please visit the Pregnant and Parenting Student Registration Form.
