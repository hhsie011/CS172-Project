As of June 2021, with OSU’s Safety & Success Plan, we have resumed on-site and in-person operations. As such, we transitioned from emphasizing operational planning to monitoring the current conditions. As part of this shift, the CMT was replaced with a smaller group — the Pathway Steering Team — comprised of representatives of major domains and functions across the university. In addition, the Pathway Team is led by Vice Provost Dan Larson, who will continue serving as OSU’s COVID-19 Response Coordinator.
