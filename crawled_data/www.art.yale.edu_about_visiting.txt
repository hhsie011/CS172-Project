To protect the health and safety of faculty, staff, and students, the university has established this policy for all visitors to the Yale campus. All visitors to campus must be invited by a university host. All visitors and their hosts must be vaccinated and boosted, when eligible. All visitors must carry vaccination and booster documentation and be prepared to provide it if asked. Both the visitor and the host must follow university mask guidance and all other university health and safety guidelines. Tours of the broader Yale campus are run by the undergraduate admission office. When campus is open, tours generally take place every day: Mon–Fri: 10:30am & 2pm Sat–Sunday: 1:30pm Yale College students provide a glimpse into the history and architecture of the University. Tours depart from the Visitor Center (149 Elm Street), cover the central campus area, and last between 1 hour and hour and 15 minutes.
