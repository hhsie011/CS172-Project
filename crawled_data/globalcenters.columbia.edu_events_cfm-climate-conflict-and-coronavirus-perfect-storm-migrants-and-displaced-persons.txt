In the US, households of undocumented migrants are often more crowded, promoting the spread of the virus, and there is concern that climate-related extreme events such as hurricanes, floods, and fires will force people into crowded emergency housing where social distancing is not possible. In many parts of the developing world, climate- and conflict-related displacement and refugee flows are intersecting with the spread of the virus, and precipitating economic downturns that make it even more difficult for countries to respond. Low income countries are seeing increased urban-to-rural flows as the poor and day laborers are either forced out (as in the case of India) or have no choice but to leave (as in parts of Africa) owing to the lack of opportunities. With many borders in developed countries now closed, those seeking amnesty are no longer able to enter.
