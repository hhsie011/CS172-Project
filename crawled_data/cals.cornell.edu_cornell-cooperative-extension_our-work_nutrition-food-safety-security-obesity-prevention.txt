To see what programs are offered in your area, visit or contact a local office. Featured programs The Expanded Food & Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP) EFNEP has been an anchor of CCE community outreach for the past 50 years. Through hands-on workshops, educators teach adults about food and exercise, food safety and security and work to foster a sense of mastery, belonging, independence and generosity among youth participants. Farmers Market Nutrition Program (FMNP) The FMNP, a state-wide effort to connect communities and populations that are food insecure with local farmers who could be put to work to feed them, is an example of CCE building bridges to deliver quality, local foods. Local associations run displays and demonstrations at farmers markets, offering samples and recipe ideas for fruits and vegetables in season. New York State Farm to School Farm to school programs in schools and early care and education sites engage young people in hands-on learning and connect families to fresh, healthy local food. In New York State, a cross-disciplinary team of Extension associates, Cornell Cooperative Extension (CCE) educators, and partners from NYS agencies work together to create better cohesion of farm to school programming across the state. Food safety trainings CCE educators work to keep consumers safe and help produce operations meet food safety standards through education and workshops on compliance and best practices. Educational offerings include important information and updates to food safety regulations, including the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) Produce Safety Rule, Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) and co-management of natural resources and food safety.
