You'll spend your junior or senior year at Dartmouth, receive your bachelor's degree from your home school, and then return to Dartmouth to complete a fifth year of engineering studies in the Bachelor of Engineering (BE) program. A Dartmouth academic year has three 10-weeks terms. The academic calendar includes 4 terms — fall, winter, spring, and summer. You can begin your first year at Dartmouth in the summer, fall, or winter term of your junior or senior year. When you return for your BE year, you'll begin classes in the fall term. After your first year at Dartmouth, you may want to pursue an internship. Contact Career Services for information about engineering internships. Career Services will also help you find a job after you finish the BE degree.

Program Options Ask your dean or advisor which program option your school follows. Option 1 (2-1-1-1) Freshman and sophomore years: home college Junior year: Dartmouth Senior year: home college BE year: Dartmouth Option 2 (3-2) Freshman, sophomore, and junior years: home college Senior and BE years: Dartmouth Course of Study Preparation for First Year at Dartmouth You should arrive at Dartmouth with solid preparation in mathematics and science, including: Calculus (3 courses through vector-valued functions) Physics (2 courses through mechanics and electromagnetism) Chemistry (1 course in general chemistry) Computer science (1 course, an introduction to computer science and programming) Courses beyond the minimum, e.g., in your science major or supportive of your engineering interest, are strongly recommended and are considered in admissions. Preparation for Bachelor of Engineering Program As part of your BA program at your home school, you should complete upper-level courses in math and science that support your engineering interests. Examples include: linear algebra and differential equations electromagnetism and atomic physics organic and physical chemistry cell, molecular, or environmental biology The Bachelor of Engineering (BE) degree also requires a full year of courses in the arts, languages, humanities, and social sciences. First Year at Dartmouth Common Core Courses (3 courses) ENGS 21: Introduction to Engineering ENGS 22: Systems ENGS 23: Distributed Systems and Fields - Requires ENGS 22. - ENGS 23 requirement is waived for students who have taken or will take an intermediate course in electromagnetism. Distributive Core Courses (choose 1 or 2 courses) ENGS 24: Science of Materials ENGS 25: Introduction to Thermodynamics ENGS 26: Control Theory - Requires ENGS 22 ENGS 27: Discrete and Probabilistic Systems ENGS 28: Embedded Systems Gateway Courses (choose 1 or 2 courses) ENGS 30: Biological Physics ENGS 31: Digital Electronics ENGS 32: Electronics: Introduction to Linear and Digital Circuits - Requires ENGS 22, at least concurrently. ENGS 33: Solid Mechanics ENGS 34: Fluid Mechanics - Requires ENGS 23. ENGS 35: Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering - Cell and Molecular Biology recommended. ENGS 36: Chemical Engineering - Requires ENGS 22 and 25. ENGS 37: Introduction to Environmental Engineering See the Undergraduate Course List for other undergraduate electives. BE Year at Dartmouth After receiving the BA degree from your home school, you'll return to Dartmouth to pursue the BE degree. Depending on your undergraduate preparation, you may have to take additional mathematics and natural science courses to meet BE degree requirements. With approval of the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education, students admitted to the BE program from other institutions, e.g., Dual Degree Program students, may transfer up to 11 STEM courses in partial fulfillment of the degree requirements. Course credit transfers approved by the Dartmouth Registrar in partial satisfaction of AB degree requirements, with approval of the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education, may be included in partial fulfillment of BE degree requirements. Courses transferred for course equivalency, or for engineering credit with no course equivalency, must be suitable for inclusion in a technical and applied science program and should be evaluated according to the process outlined by the Thayer Registrar for course transfers. Courses transferred in fulfillment of the math and natural science requirements for the BE program will first be assessed by the Dual Degree Program Director, the BE Program Committee, or appropriate math/science instructors at Dartmouth. Prior to approval for transfer, additional supporting material may be required, including course catalog descriptions, textbook information, syllabi, etc. See BE Degree Requirements for more details. Information & Planning Program Information Additional details for prospective Dual-Degree students. Dual-Degree – Prospective Student Information Program Planning Course planning guide for enrolled Dual-Degree students. Dual-Degree – Program Planning Guide Tuition & Expenses First Year at Dartmouth Students applying for the first year in the Dartmouth dual-degree program should consult with their home school's registrar regarding tuition. Expenses at Dartmouth shows a break-down of expenses for the current year at Dartmouth. Second Year at Thayer School Students in the second year of the dual-degree program are Bachelor of Engineering candidates and pay BE tuition to Thayer School of Engineering. Expenses vary greatly depending on the student's choice of housing and eating arrangements. Financial aid can considerably lower these costs. Housing First Year at Dartmouth First-year dual-degree students live on campus in Dartmouth undergraduate housing. Second Year at Thayer School Second-year dual-degree students are responsible for arranging their own housing. Information about the local rental market is at Dartmouth College Real Estate Office. Students can also contact engs@Dartmouth.edu for local listing information. Financial Aid First Year at Dartmouth First-year students are not eligible for financial aid from Dartmouth since they are on exchange from their home college. Students who have financial aid from their home college should check with their registrar to see whether that financial aid can follow them to Dartmouth. Second Year at Thayer School Second-year dual-degree students are BE candidates and are eligible for financial aid from Thayer School. Admissions Admission to the Dual-Degree Program is through Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth admissions office. First-Year Dual-Degree Students Review the informative guide for prospective students: Dual-Degree – Prospective Student Information Consult with your dean or academic advisor regarding the acceptability of Dartmouth courses toward the degree requirements of your college. Obtain approval from your college to participate in the program, and check on financial aid. Apply through our online Dual-Degree application by February 1 prior to the year you are planning to attend, depending on the program option you choose. For the 2-1-1-1 program option, apply by February 1 of your sophomore year. For the 3-2 program option, apply by February 1 of your junior year.
