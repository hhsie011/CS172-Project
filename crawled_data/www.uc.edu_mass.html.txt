Clifton MASS Center Location and Summer Hours: Monday-Thursday, 11am-5pm 2133 French Hall West In-person services only at UC Clifton Study Table Schedule Supplemental Review Sessions Apply to be an SRS Leader or MASS Tutor The MASS Center includes free tutor-supported study tables for many undergraduate mathematics courses, in addition to several science courses that require strong mathematical competency. The MASS Center also offers a 1-credit hour course, MATH 1096 Supplemental Review Sessions (SRS) to assist students with their math course. The MASS Center offers study tables for several courses across the university. By reviewing the schedule below and attending the study table for their course at the assigned time, students can guarantee that a tutor will be available to support them and their fellow classmates when they arrive. Students are welcome to drop into the MASS Center during a time their course is not offered. MASS Tutors may be able to assist them with their course outside of the listed hours. Students can check with the MASS Front Desk Assistant to see if a tutor is available. Study tables provide a collaborative learning space so that students can learn from their peers who have excelled (the table leader) as well as their fellow class members attending the study table. Tutors at MASS study tables will not directly aid with graded homework or course assignments, nor do they "solve" the problems for students. Rather, MASS Center tutors will work with you to determine how to succeed in your class and with a given content question. If you are seeking one-on-one, appointment-based tutoring, you can schedule a personalized appointment with a Peer Tutor via TracCloud. Summer 2022 Study Table Schedule The MASS Center will offer in-person services for the spring semester. To drop-in for a study table, visit the MASS Center in 2133 French Hall West (Clifton campus). Note: Please check the schedule often, as changes may occur the during the semester!
