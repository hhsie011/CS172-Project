Print Degree Planner (opens a new window) | Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Facebook this Page (opens a new window) Tweet this Page (opens a new window) (120 UNITS) The requirements for the B.S. in Electrical Engineering comprise three major segments: foundation courses in mathematics and the physical sciences; general education courses in the arts, humanities and other related areas; and a sequence of courses to fulfill the requirements of the Electrical Engineering degree. Students are required to meet with their academic adviser every semester during the first year and at least once a year thereafter. Students are strongly encouraged to see their academic advisers frequently. All courses taken in fulfillment of the requirements for the bachelor’s degree must be taken for a letter grade. All mathematics and physical science courses required for the degree must be completed with at least a “C-” (1.7) to count as credit towards the degree. Graduate courses are not open to undergraduate students without approval of the program coordinator. 2 + 2 Articulated Program with Community Colleges The department has developed 2+2 articulation agreements with community colleges to provide students seamless transfer to the CSUF Electrical Engineering Program. This allows full-time students, taking the courses specified by the Electrical Engineering Department each semester, to graduate in two years following transfer to CSUF. High School Preparation Entering freshman preparation should include two years of algebra, geometry, trigonometry and one year of physics or chemistry. Students deficient in mathematics must take special preparatory courses, e.g., MATH 125 , which will not carry credit for the major. (See Mathematics Section for Entry Level Mathematics test and Math-Science Qualifying Examination requirements.) Transfer Students Transfer students shall complete a minimum of 30 units in residence, at least 15 of which are in upper-division engineering courses. Work taken at another college or university with a “D” (1.0) may not be substituted for upper-division courses. Mathematics and Science Courses (31 units) CHEM 123 - Chemistry for Engineers (3) MATH 150A - Calculus I (4) MATH 150B - Calculus II (4) MATH 250A - Calculus III (4) MATH 250B - Introduction to Linear Algebra and Differential Equations (4) PHYS 225 - Fundamental Physics: Mechanics (3) PHYS 225L - Fundamental Physics: Laboratory (1) PHYS 226 - Fundamental Physics: Electricity and Magnetism (3) PHYS 226L - Fundamental Physics: Laboratory (1) PHYS 227 - Fundamental Physics: Waves, Optics, and Modern Physics (1-3) PHYS 227L - Fundamental Physics: Laboratory (1) General Education All students at Cal State Fullerton are expected to complete prescribed units of General Education that are made up of courses outside of their chosen disciplines. Students seeking a degree in Engineering have been provided exceptions from some of the General Education requirements. For this reason, it is important that students take the approved G.E. courses for Engineering majors that are found in their Titan Degree Audit (TDA). Additionally, they should confirm the G.E. courses that are required within their specific programs with their respective advisers. Upper-Division Writing Requirement All of the following courses are required to fulfill the upper-division English writing requirement: EGEE 303L - Electronics Laboratory (1) EGEE 310L - Electronic Circuits Lab (1) EGEE 313L - Machine + Analog Comp Lab (1) EGEE 485 - Electrical Engineering Design Projects Laboratory (3) Additional Information Written work for these courses must meet professional standards. All these courses must be passed with at least a “C” (2.0).

Technical Electives in Electrical Engineering (15 units) Before enrolling in any elective course, approval of the adviser must be obtained. At least three units of design content must be included. EGEE 497 and EGEE 499 are elective courses; students must complete a study application form and submit it for approval to the supervising faculty member and the department chair prior to the semester in which the coursework is to begin.
