James Dorsey will be the MA Graduate Advisor in 2022/2023. For over twenty years, Dartmouth's Comparative Literature Program has been a welcoming, nourishing, and intellectually stimulating place for the comparative study of literatures and cultures. Our program is limited to 10-12 students. We have more than twenty five faculty, some directly affiliated with the Program and others at home in a variety of humanities departments and interdisciplinary clusters, who teach and mentor in the Program to create the support system for which we are known. Our graduate students' learning, reading, and research also benefit from Dartmouth's internationally renowned intensive language education and the College's library (and, in some cases, rare library) holdings and its extensive and efficient interlibrary book-borrowing channels. One of the librarians teaches in the Program and works closely with the graduate students to help them develop their projects and understand the available resources better. The Director of Graduate Studies accompanies all students through the year and, in consultation with the faculty mentors, helps each student design their study plan and fields their questions. The program aims to introduce you to graduate education and advanced scholarly work through application-focused courses on theory and methods and basic pedagogical training, to deepen and broaden your personal interests, and to let you learn something about yourself in the process. Some of our alumni decide to pursue advanced graduate degrees, while others find jobs outside the academy. We support you with all your applications and run professional development workshops to help you map the wide horizons of the professional world connected to the comparative study of literatures and cultures. Last but not least, we pride ourselves on offering equal financial support to all admitted applicants and on fostering solidary and collegial relationships within each cohort.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Comparative Literature Program Undergraduate About the Program Courses Courses Recommended For First Year Students Course Descriptions Major How to Apply Minor in Translation Studies Honors Thesis Program Thesis Timeline Past Theses Awards & Prizes Undergraduate Alumni Undergraduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Graduate Overview About the Program Current MA Students How to Apply Degree Requirements Courses Graduate Alumni Graduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Academic Achievement Award COLT MA Graduate Handbook News & Events Overview Annual Hoffman Lecture Annual Zantop Memorial Lecture People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
