RISE works with countries to Project Details RISE is a 5-year global project funded by the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). RISE works with countries to achieve a shared vision of attaining and maintaining epidemic control, with stronger local partners capable of managing and achieving results with direct funding, and sustainable, self-reliant, and resilient health systems by 2024. RISE’s contributions to this work will lead to decreased HIV-related morbidity and mortality and decreased numbers of new HIV infections, and increased quality of life for PLHIV and decreased numbers of people at risk for acquiring HIV. RISE supports USAID PEPFAR countries to achieve and maintain epidemic control through strategic technical assistance and direct service delivery to improve HIV prevention, case finding, and treatment programming. The primary objectives of the RISE project are to: 1) Attain and maintain HIV epidemic control among at risk adult men, women, and priority populations; 2) Attain and maintain HIV epidemic control among key populations in RISE supported countries; 3) Strengthened health systems including improved program management, health information systems, human resources for health utilization, and financial systems to ensure attainment and maintenance of epidemic control; and 4) to support the transition to capable local partners to meet the PEPFAR goal of 70% of funding to local partners by 2020. RISE-Burundi’s goal is to close the performance gaps across the HIV clinical cascade and to maintain program achievements while supporting four provinces including Kirundo, Ngozi, Kayanza and Bujumbura Marie to be better positioned to graduate from PEPFAR support through reinforcing local ownership and sustainable results and contributing to overall stronger country-led HIV/AIDS programs at provincial level.
