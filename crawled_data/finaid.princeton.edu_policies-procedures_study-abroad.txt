Your financial aid will be adjusted based on the cost of your program. If your semester abroad is less than Princeton's costs, your Princeton job will first be reduced, followed by your Princeton grant. If the costs are greater than Princeton's, your grant will be increased to meet the costs. We will use the approved budget forwarded to us by the Office of International Programs.
