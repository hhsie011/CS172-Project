Learning and Educational Sciences Overview Courses Undergraduate Programs Graduate Programs Minors Faculty Shelbie Witte, PhD—Chuck and Kim Watson Endowed Chair and School Head The School of Teaching, Learning and Educational Sciences develops outstanding education professionals and school psychologists who have the confidence and demonstrated competence to be leaders, advocates, and agents of change in regional, national and world communities. We employ and model authentic, engaging methods and innovative, collaborative practices to develop scholars, especially teachers, teacher educators and school psychologists who are transformative leaders and reflective practitioners adept at using creative and effective methods to foster productive and just communities. Programs in the School of Teaching, Learning and Educational Sciences (STLES) include curriculum studies, elementary education, gifted and talented education, secondary education, literacy education, science/mathematics education, special education and school psychology. Consistent with the University’s Professional Education unit conceptual framework, all programs leading to teacher certification at both initial and advanced levels incorporate the L.E.A.D.S. framework based on leadership, ethics and professionalism, academic and professional roles, diversity and service orientation/community outreach. Graduate program goals in STLES focus on the concepts of agency, pedagogy, diversity and research. Course Prefixes Most courses in STLES programs carry the CIED (Curriculum and Instruction) prefix. Other course prefixes include CTED (Career and Technical Education), GTED (Gifted and Talented Education), LLCE (Language, Literacy & Culture), SPED (Special Education), SMED (Science/Mathematics Education), and SPSY (School Psychology). Undergraduate Programs Jill Metzger, MS—Clinical Instructor and Elementary Education Coordinator Shanedra Nowell, PhD—Associate Professor and Secondary Education Coordinator The School offers undergraduate degrees in elementary, secondary, and K-12 education. The Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education degree qualifies the student for an Oklahoma elementary teaching certificate (grades 1-8). The program is intended to provide students with: a breadth of knowledge reflecting the broad traditions of general education, and a depth of knowledge in the area of specialization. The degree includes four field experiences, culminating in a full-semester clinical internship, through which students work in diverse school settings and demonstrate and strengthen their pedagogical knowledge. This degree is offered on both the Stillwater and Tulsa campuses. Stillwater students can apply to the ExCEL experience, providing site-based coursework in Stillwater elementary schools for the final two semesters of enrollment. The culminating clinical internship placement opportunities include placement in accredited schools in Stillwater and the surrounding area or international placement.

The thesis is original research. The student’s Advisory Committee (three members) assists the student through all aspects of the program. Application to the Graduate College precedes program admission decisions. For unqualified admission an applicant must have completed an undergraduate degree in Education or a related field and must submit a curriculum vita and goals statement aligned with the option area chosen. Option areas have minimum grade-point requirements for the undergraduate degree and may have additional materials that make up the admissions packet. Doctoral Program The Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree requires a minimum of 69 semester hours beyond the master's degree. Application to the Graduate College precedes program admission decisions. For program admission, candidates submit scores from the Graduate Record Exam or the Miller Analogies Test, a Statement of Goals and Objectives, references and examples of written expression. An interview may be required. To enter candidacy, students must pass a qualifying exam. Candidates conduct independent, original research reported through a dissertation. The student’s Advisory Committee (four members) assists the student through all aspects of the program. Financial Aid Some support is available each year for research assistantships and for qualified graduate students to assume teaching responsibilities in the undergraduate curriculum. Interested persons are encouraged to apply at any time. Applications can be obtained from the School of Teaching, Learning and Education Sciences.
