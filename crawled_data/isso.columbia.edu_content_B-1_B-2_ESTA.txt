The eligibility criteria for admission are identical to those seeking admission based on a B-1/B-2 visa. University Policy Compliance with U.S. immigration regulations requires that the nature of the activities in the United States be considered and not simply the duration of the proposed visit. As per Columbia University policy, those admitted to the U.S. as B-1 or B-2 or through the Visa Waiver Program are not eligible for a University ID Card or UNI, Visiting Scholar/Scientist Designation, or Academic Appointment. The decision regarding visa type should not be made by the proposed visitor, even though they consider it “easier” to enter as a Business Visitor/Tourist rather than apply for another type of visa. Visitor for Business (B-1)/WB (ESTA) Acceptable activities and criteria Acceptable activities at Columbia include: ✓ Observing (restricted to medical observers at CUIMC) ✓ Consulting ✓ Conferences and seminars Additional criteria ✓ The visit must be short-term in nature ✓ The visitor must have a profession or be engaged in studies outside the United States to which he or she plans to return ✓ Will not receive a salary from any U.S. source Inappropriate Activities ✓ Collaborative research, ✓ Academic/scholarly exchange or ✓ Holding an academic appointment, paid or unpaid Visitor for Tourism (B-2)/WT (ESTA) Acceptable activities and criteria ✓ Tourism, e.g., visiting Disneyworld or the Grand Canyon ✓ Visiting friends or relatives ✓ Participation by amateurs in musical, sporting or similar events or contests (with no compensation) Honoraria and Visitor Status (B or ESTA) Payment of honoraria is very limited. Consult the Columbia Finance Allowable Payments by Visa Type chart before confirming the terms of any proposed entry as a business visitor or tourist.
