With this series, we hope to offer a platform where African writers can engage a global audience, offering not just their work, but exciting perspectives on how personal, political, and cultural experiences drive their storytelling. Our second book in this series is "Of Pawns and Players" by Kinyanjui Kombani, which is the story of Tomas Karamu, a mutura vendor who is trying to make ends meet. His involvement with the daughter of a rich and prominent man traps him in a betting syndicate. Tomas is in a dilemma between what is morally right and what will keep him out of trouble. What will he choose? In a fine work of contemporary literature, Kinyanjui Kombani highlights the plight of today’s youth in a country rife with corruption, exploitation, and poverty without sounding depressing.
