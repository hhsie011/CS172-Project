As a Princeton student, you are not required or expected to borrow to meet your demonstrated financial need. While this policy has made it possible for many students to graduate Princeton with little to no debt, some families may wish to take advantage of loans to help finance the cost of college, including the parent or student contribution. It is our policy to minimize student borrowing whenever possible and to assist families in selecting the best loan available once the decision to borrow has been made. Because loans are not required in the Princeton financial aid package, any student or parent who borrows does so on their own initiative. If you are interested in a student or parent loan, please contact our office to review your loan options and eligibility.
