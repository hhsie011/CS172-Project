Baylor>Academy for Teaching and Learning>Programs>Active Learning Lab Fellowship Active Learning Lab Fellowship The Active Learning Lab Fellowship is a partnership between University Libraries and the Academy for Teaching and Learning. In 2018, Baylor unveiled the Active Learning Lab (first floor, Moody library), a flexible, technology-enhanced 56-seat learning space whose primary purpose is providing space and resources for instructors using active learning methods. “Active” learning—purposeful engagement with course material aided by students interacting with others (instructors or peers) or themselves—is associated with a host of positive student outcomes (Freeman, et al.). However, instructors face many obstacles in using active methods: lack of time to experiment and design, lack of ideas or knowledge of effective methods, lack of community to reflect upon teaching, and lack of space and resources. This fellowship aims to increase the implementation, awareness, and quality of active learning at Baylor by: maximizing the use of the Active Learning Lab for full-semester courses; encouraging faculty to experiment with, reflect upon, and improve their interactive learning strategies; disseminating knowledge of active learning and sparking conversation; and fostering support for similar active learning spaces across campus. Through a competitive application process, fellows will be selected each year who demonstrate their interest in active learning and plans for using the Active Learning Lab. Selected faculty will receive the title of Active Learning Fellow, use of the Active Learning Lab for a full semester course, and a $500 award. In return, fellows participate in assessment of the instructor and student experience and meet three times as a group with representatives of the University Libraries and the Academy for Teaching and Learning, discussing pedagogy literature and their classroom experiences. Additionally, fellows will present or discuss their work in a public Active Learning Community Forum at the end of their semester teaching in the Active Learning Lab. Applications for Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 are due April 1, 2022. For questions, contact Christopher Richmann, christopher_richmann@baylor.edu.
