New hubs for entrepreneurs and tech mavens have sprung up in neighborhoods all over the city. In Brooklyn, areas like DUMBO and the Brooklyn Navy Yard have exploded with new ventures and digital entrepreneurs. In Manhattan, our own Columbia Startup Lab found a home in Silicon Alley, another start-up-heavy area that stretches from the Flatiron District down to Soho and Tribeca. The lab provides recently graduated entrepreneurs continued access to Columbia resources, faculty advisors, programming, and events. All around the city, sparks are flying with business initiatives, giving our graduates even more opportunities to intern, work, and find success in New York City. Beyond business opportunities, the city is also a cultural capital featuring the bright lights of Broadway, the expansive greens in Central Park, museums, sporting events, live music, and much more. There's no shortage of neighborhoods to explore and sights to see. And it's all within a short subway ride of the Columbia campus.
