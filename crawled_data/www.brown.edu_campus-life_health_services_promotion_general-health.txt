On these pages you will find information on a wide range of physical and emotional health concerns and topics. Use the tabs above in the General Health section to find information on topics ranging from sleep and stress to trans health and pregnancy. Don't let this information take the place of regular medical care and be sure to access the Health and Wellness Services on campus as needed. Sun Safety and Skin Cancer Numerous studies have found that skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the United States, with melanoma as one of the most common cancers diagnosed among young adults. Ultraviolet (UV) light exposure outdoors or indoors (tanning beds) can increase your risk of skin cancer. UV exposure is a major contributor to visible skin aging (wrinkles, leathery skin, etc.). Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States. Consent Consent is a concept that can be applied to everyday social interactions as well as sexual experiences. People have a variety of values around bodily autonomy which may impact their preferences around physical interaction, so it is important to speak with people ahead of time about their expectations and personal boundaries. The information in this article is intended to help well-meaning people take care of themselves and each other in sexual situations, but it is important to be aware that the language of consent may be manipulated to hurt someone. Community, Connection and Coping: Remote Resources Welcome to BWell’s Remote Resources Page. We hope the connection and empowerment tools offered here can help us continue to build community and nurture wellbeing as we learn to navigate our Brown experience across new distances. Concussion Homophobia Homophobic words, threats, or even violence can be very damaging to our sense of safety. Each person's response will be unique and may be different from situation to situation. Addressing homophobia without escalating the situation is the best option, but that's not always possible if you feel intimidated, threatened, or if you're not out of the closet. At Brown, you will find that you have allies and supports in students and student groups, in the staff and administration, and in the faculty. Here are some ideas for ways to handle an incident of homophobia: Self-Care Techniques for Stress Relief There is no single relaxation technique that is best for everyone. How you react to stress may influence the relaxation technique that works best for you: Wellness on Campus There are lots of resources to keep you emotionally and physically well here at Brown. Gender Care This page is meant to provide information and resources for gender affirming care so you can take steps to be in control of your health. Because there is a wide range of gender identities and experiences, not all of the topics presented below may be relevant for you. Unlearning Toxic Masculinity Rigid definitions of masculinity are toxic to men's health. Even the World Health Organization (WHO) has recognized that men's tendency to die at younger ages may correlate to the harmful ways that masculinity has been defined in society and the ways that men have been conditioned to practice it.
