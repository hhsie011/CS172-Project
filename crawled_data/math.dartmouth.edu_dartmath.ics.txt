In 1997 Richard Stanley found a bijection between the maximal chains in the lattice and parking functions. We investigated what happens under the bijection when we restrict to certain induced sublattices\, and enumerated maximal chains in those cases. Joint with Shreya Ahirwar\, Parikshita Gya\, Pamela E.

Gabber proved that over the complex numbers\, the product of elliptic curves with algebraically independent j-invariants has nontrivial unramified cohomology in top degree. I’ll explain joint work with V. Suresh extending such a result to products of elliptic curves over the rational numbers\, and more generally\, to fields admitting a nontrivial discrete valuation. In particular\, this leads to an amusing open problem where elliptic curves whose j-invariants are certain algebraic units cause the most difficulty.

Indeed\, in June 2020\, the FDA released guidelines on pooled testing procedures that are now available to diagnostic laboratories. \n\nPooled testing\, as described in the popular press and the FDA's ruling\, is one model for combinatorial group testing. In this talk\, I will discuss a variety of mathematical models for combinatorial group testing\, including the design of both the pooling matrix and the decoding algorithms. I will cover major mathematical and algorithmic results in combinatorial group testing and then address what these mathematical results have to say about the practical application of pooled testing. The mathematical tools span a variety of areas from error correcting codes to expander graphs. As with many scientific and technological endeavors\, the gap between theory and practice is enormous. (While many of the popular press articles detailed the origins of combinatorial group testing\, many left out that it was never actually used in its original form!) On a more positive note\, I will give some examples of where combinatorial group testing is used in "theory applications."

The most popular means of computing the DFT\nis the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). However\, with the emergence of\nbig data problems\, in which the size of the processed data sets can\neasily exceed terabytes\, the “Fast” in Fast Fourier Transform is often\nno longer fast enough. In addition\, in many big data applications it\nis hard to acquire a sufficient amount of data in order to compute the\ndesired Fourier transform in the first place. The Sparse Fourier\nTransform (SFT) addresses the big data setting by computing a\ncompressed Fourier transform using only a subset of the input data\, in\ntime sub-linear in the data set size. The goal of this talk is to\nsurvey these recent developments\, to explain the basic techniques with\nexamples and applications in big data\, to demonstrate trade-offs in\nempirical performance of the algorithms\, and to discuss the connection\nbetween the SFT and other techniques for massive data analysis such as\nstreaming algorithms and compressive sensing.

This map and its generalizations as well as the concept of homomesy\, where a statistic has constant average over the orbits of an action\, are frequently studied in Dynamical Algebraic Combinatorics. We will discuss a new generalization of rowmotion\, which we call r-rowmotion\, and some associated homomesies. Additionally\, we discuss how r-rowmotion relates to other generalizations of rowmotion and some combinatorial consequences.

Since we also do\narithmetic with these numbers\, it seems natural to combine the two\nand consider permutations with arithmetic constraints. An interesting\npaper from 1983 of Erdos\, Freud\, and Hegyvari did just this\, and\nthere are several other papers in the literature\, including one of\nJackson from 1977.

The intermediate Jacobian is an obstruction to rationality in dimension 3\, first introduced over the complex numbers by Clemens–Griffiths to show that cubic threefolds are irrational. Hassett–Tschinkel and Benoist–Wittenberg recently refined the intermediate Jacobian obstruction over non-closed fields by introducing an intermediate Jacobian torsor (IJT) obstruction. In joint work with L. Ji\, S. Sankar\, B. Viray\, and I. Vogt\, we identify the torsors arising in the IJT obstruction for conic bundle threefolds over P^2\, and use this information to show that the IJT obstruction does not determine rationality in the case of conic bundle threefolds with degree 4 discriminant locus.

Thanks to the Benamou-Brenier formulation\, it provides a meaningful functional in the image science like image and shape registrations. However\, exact computation through LP or PDE is in general not practical in large scale\, while the popular entropy-regularized method introduces additional diffusion noise\, deteriorating shapes and boundaries. Until the recent work [Jacobs and Leger\, A Fast Approach to Optimal Transport: the back-and-forth method\, Numerische Mathematik\, 2020]\, solving OT in a both accurate and fast fashion finally becomes possible. Multiple marginal optimal transport is a natural extension from OT but has its own interest and is in general more computationally expensive. The entropy method suffers from both diffusion noise and high dimensional computational issues. In this work with Matthew Parno\, we extend from two marginals to multiple marginals\, on a wide class of cost functions when those marginals have a graph structure. This new method is fast and does not introduce diffusion. As a result\, the new proposed method can be used in many fields those require sharp boundaries. If time allows\, we will illustrate by examples the faithful joint recover via MMOT of images with sharp boundaries\, with applications on sea ice prediction.\n LOCATION:041 Haldeman URL:https://math.dartmouth.edu/calendar/agenda-colloq.php END:VEVENT BEGIN:VEVENT DTSTAMP:20220601T171701Z UID:20220601T13170162979f0dc4e06@math.dartmouth.edu DTSTART;TZID=America/New_York:20220523T160000 CATEGORIES:Logic Seminar SUMMARY:TBA: TBA LOCATION:Kemeny 307 END:VEVENT BEGIN:VEVENT DTSTAMP:20220601T171701Z UID:20220601T13170162979f0dc4e8d@math.dartmouth.edu DTSTART;TZID=America/New_York:20220524T100000 DTEND;TZID=America/New_York:20220524T110000 CATEGORIES:Combinatorics Seminar SUMMARY:Bruce Sagan: Stirling numbers in type B DESCRIPTION:The ordinary Stirling numbers count set partitions and permutations of {1\, 2\, ...\, n} by number of blocks and number of cycles\, respectively.

It is then natural to ask how frequently each of these torsion subgroups occur? More generally\, one can ask\, how frequently do elliptic curves with a given level structure occur? Recently there have been many results addressing this question by giving asymptotics for the number of elliptic curves of bounded height with a prescribed level structure. Most of these results have been over the rational numbers. In this talk I will discuss how one can extend many of these results to arbitrary number fields.

One classical open problem in combinatorial representation theory is the ``Restriction Problem”. This problem asks for a combinatorial description of the coefficients when we restrict a polynomial irreducible representation of GL_n to the symmetric group. It is known that these coefficients have a description in terms of plethysm.\n\nIn this talk I will describe how we can use diagram algebras to study both the restriction problem and plethysm. I will describe recent results about the representation theory of the algebra of uniform block permutations and how it connects to both the plethysm and the restriction problem.

Harathi '22: Cliquey Mutants Can Win: Evolutionary Dynamics on Two-Clique and Clique-Like Graphs with Resource Heterogeneity DESCRIPTION:The evolutionary dynamics of a finite population can be modeled on graphs\, where individuals inhabit nodes of the graph and competing types reproduce\, migrate\, and die. We explore the dynamics of the Moran process\, where a mutant type and a resident type compete for fixation influenced by their reproductive advantages. Previous literature has explored how characteristics of graphs can affect the likelihood of mutant success. In particular\, related research explores graph structure\, which influences offspring migration\, and graph coloring\, which models environmental impacts on reproduction. We expand on this work by evaluating mutant fixation on two-colored two-clique and clique-like graphs\, representing connected islands of nodes with high-quality resources and low-quality resources. This paper explores how increasing connectivity between and within these islands\, varying island sizes\, changing fitness heterogeneity for both types\, modeling resource depletion impact the fixation probability of a mutant type. Firstly\, we find that as environmental variability increases\, increasing clique inter-connectivity typically decreases fixation probability. Secondly\, we learn that increasing the relative size of low-quality resource cliques increases fixation probability. Thirdly\, we find that fixation probability is generally highest when residents but not mutants are susceptible to environmental heterogeneity. Lastly\, we conclude that resource depletion can actually improve mutant success rates. Overall\, mutants perform better with cliques--specifically those that have fewer inter-connections\, more poor-quality nodes\, less environmental variation\, and more resource degradation.

For example\, twenty-five of the twenty-six sporadic groups have been realized over the rational numbers\, with the famous exception of $M_{23}$. In this thesis\, we approach inverse Galois theory by examining Belyi maps\, coverings of the complex projective line ramified over no more than three points. By viewing Belyi maps with geometric monodromy group $G$ as families of $G$-extensions over a number field $K$\, we consider the problem of ``specialization" in order to exhibit families of $H$-extensions with $H \\leq G$. Our main result is a formula for the genus of the ``specialization map" that gives $H$-specializations for the family of $G$-extensions. Using the specialization method\, we provide explicit examples of families of polynomials with Galois group $H\\leq G$. Moreover\, in the event that we have a family of $G$-extensions of $K$ with $K \\neq \\mathbb{Q}$\, we consider the problem of ``arithmetic descent" to construct $G$-extensions of $\\mathbb{Q}$ from this family. We give a concrete descent condition for prime-order Kummer extensions\, and we discuss the more general cyclic order $n$ case. We then provide a theoretical description of the conditions for descending general Galois number fields.

An introduction to the theory will be presented in an inviting manner - I really believe that the ideas can be appreciated without a heavy math background. The specific question we ask is the following: Given a finite group\, is it possible to realize that group as the Galois group of some extension of the rational numbers? This is known as the Inverse Galois Problem(IGP) and remains open today. There are partial results\; the IGP is resolved in the affirmative for solvable groups for instance. Also\, all but one of the 26 sporadic groups have been realized over the rationals - M23 remains open(despite the best efforts of this thesis!). Our approach uses Belyi maps\, coverings of the complex projective line ramified over no more than three points. By Belyi's theorem\, the compact Riemann surfaces that admit Belyi maps are precisely those that are projective algebraic curves defined over the algebraic numbers\, making them great candidates for studying Galois theory. Fixing a finite group G and considering Belyi maps with monodromy group G\, we generate families of polynomials with Galois group G over some number field K (sometimes K is the rationals\, at least when the group theory works out). From here\, we consider the problem of arithmetic descent: exhibiting G-extensions of the rationals when given G-extensions of K. For the descent problem\, we have the most pleasing results for Kummer extensions. The general case is difficult\; we do present a theoretical (though not computable in most cases) description of the conditions for descent.

A regular map is one that exhibits the maximal amount of symmetry\, that is\, the automorphism group of the map acts transitively on flags. In 1985\, James and Jones classified complete regular maps\, i.e. regular maps where the underlying graph is complete. The first goal of my talk is briefly review this story and mention Biggs’ construction of complete regular maps as Cayley maps associated to finite fields. \n\nThe main objective of my talk is to present on complete regular dessins\, which are dessins associated to complete regular maps. After reviewing the basic theory of dessins\, I will introduce the main question: can one obtain an explicit model for the Riemann surface underlying a complete regular dessin as an algebraic curve over $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$? What about the its Belyi function as a rational map down to $\\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{C})$? In this talk I will explain how to obtain such Belyi pairs for the complete regular dessins of genus one. In the process\, we will be led to consider arithmetic in the Gaussian/Eisenstein integers\, uniformization of elliptic curves\, Galois theory of function fields and Weierstrass ℘ functions. If time permits\, I will present some of my ideas on how to tackle the problem of obtaining explicit models of complete regular dessins in genus greater than one.
