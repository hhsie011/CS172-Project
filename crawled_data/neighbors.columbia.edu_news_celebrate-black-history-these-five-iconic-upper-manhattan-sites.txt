By Jessica Reyes February 10, 2022 February is dedicated to Black History and what better way to celebrate than by exploring some historic landmarks that are within walking distance of Columbia’s campus. There is something for everyone, from music lover to literary buff, so grab your favorite walking shoes and clean the camera lens on your phone because you’re definitely going to want to capture the moment as you experience the rich history of Upper Manhattan. The Apollo Theater Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, Jazmine Sullivan, and Lauryn Hill are just some of the greats that have performed at the iconic Apollo Theater on 125th Street. You don't even have to go to Hollywood to strut down a walk of fame since the Apollo has its very own outside the theater. It honors the legends that have graced the Apollo stage and contributed to its legacy. While you're there, check out the upcoming programs, and don’t forget to try out for Amateur Night, which is held every other Wednesday. It doesn't matter what your talent is, everyone is welcome!

The opening line to Langston Hughes's poignant poem, Harlem, has become emblematic of the Harlem Renaissance, and Hughes remains one of the foremost figures of the era. His home, a brownstone on East 127th Street, has become a welcoming venue for community engagement and a showcase for poets, artists, and musicians. The Malcolm X & Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center When it was the Audubon Ballroom, The Malcolm X & Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center in Washington Heights was frequented by Malcolm X and his wife Betty Shabazz during the Civil Rights Movement. It is also where the civil rights leader was assassinated. Today, it is partly a living memorial (spearheaded by the Shabazz family) that honors the contributions that Malcolm X made to social justice, and partly a venue for community events.
