The painting in the background is a full-length portrait of Queen Elizabeth I made circa 1567. The exhibition “Marc Quinn: History Painting +” displays contemporary works by Quinn alongside the museum’s historical collections. A young woman stands defiantly as two police officers clad in body armor and riot helmets attempt to arrest her. They reach for her and yet seem to fall away, as though her poise repels them. The woman, Ieshia Evans, was protesting the July 2016 killing of Alton Sterling by police officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Freelance photographer Jonathan Bachman captured the dramatic moment in a now iconic photograph. When artist Marc Quinn saw Bachman’s photo, he was struck by Evans’ power. “She is so self-possessed,” Quinn said. “She is so in charge of herself, her aim, and her fate.” The artist purchased the rights to the image and recreated it as a photorealistic modern history painting, part of a series he made that upends tropes of 18th-century history paintings, an artistic genre which often glorified empire and aristocracy. “History Painting Ieshia Evans Protesting the Death of Alton Sterling (Baton Rouge, 9 July 2016) GPBWOR” captures the moment when police officers attempted to arrest Ieshia Evans, a nurse, who quietly and poignantly defied them. The painting of Evans joins five other works by Quinn in “Marc Quinn: History Painting +,” a new exhibition at the Yale Center for British Art (YCBA) on view through Oct. 16. The show juxtaposes four of Quinn’s history paintings with works by J.M.W. Turner, Joshua Reynolds, Thomas Gainsborough, and other luminaries of British art represented in the museum’s fourth-floor galleries, offering fresh perspectives on the YCBA’s historic collections. It also features two sculptures by Quinn, one of which is made from the artist’s own frozen blood. “Marc Quinn offers a contemporary comment on the British artistic traditions, such as landscape and history painting, which are well-represented in the museum’s collection,” said Courtney J. Martin, the Paul Mellon Director of the Yale Center for British Art. “Placed in dialogue with 18th- and 19th-century paintings and sculptures, his work directly engages our historic collections, offering new perspectives on these works and expanding the comprehension of our collection for a wider audience.” The exhibition begins in the museum’s Entrance Court where visitors will encounter “Self 1991,” a self-portrait bust Quinn made by freezing 10 pints of his blood — roughly the amount circulating through an adult’s body — in a cast of his head. Quinn discussed the sculpture and the other works on view during a recent talk at the YCBA with Martina Droth, the museum’s deputy director and chief curator, who organized the exhibition. The sculpture, which must be continually refrigerated to hold its form, provides commentary on both the fragility of human life and the body’s restorative qualities, Quinn said, noting that our blood supplies are continually renewed. “I love things that seem to be one thing and then are the opposite,” he said. “Then you have this sculpture that looks quite gory, like a decapitated head, but in fact it’s about the amazing power of the body to rejuvenate itself.” The blood contains data on Quinn’s genetic composition, ancestry, and health, forming a kind of “biological library” about him, he noted. He has produced a new bust in the same fashion every five years since making the initial sculpture in 1991. The show continues onto the fourth floor, where, just beyond the elevators, visitors will encounter “Thames River Water Atlas,” a sculpture reflecting on the famous river and the unseen infrastructure that circulates water (and sewage) throughout London. A departure from the romanticism of J.M.W. Turner’s beloved seascapes, the sculpture reinvents landscape painting in an era of climate change and environmental degradation, Quinn explained, creating a sense of “Turner in the Age of Apocalypse.” The sculpture’s canvas bears impressions of manhole covers and refuse made directly on the city’s streets. It is affixed to an aluminum backing, which is bent into an accordion shape and can fold up to form an artist’s book. The river, outlined in red paint, winds across the sculpture’s folds. “I wanted it to be almost like a found object that had fallen off the back of a truck or a side panel of a building,” Quinn said. The artist began creating his “History Painting” series in 2011 against the backdrop of protests and unrest across the globe in which people attempted to overhaul the social order from the bottom up. “I thought maybe it’d be quite interesting to take these images from what’s happening now and turn them into history paintings,” he said, noting that history paintings by the old masters tend to celebrate a stratified society in which monarchs and aristocrats wielded power from the top down. Quinn’s works turn this notion of social control onto its head, he explained. The four paintings are photorealistic representations of news photographs that depict individuals engaged in revolutionary acts or, like Evans, standing against injustice. From a distance, each appears like a photograph, but a close look exposes Quinn’s brushstrokes. “I think it’s actually very powerful that you can clearly see that they’re based on photographs, but they’re so painstakingly recreated in paint and so they do enter a very different temporal space,” Droth noted. Once he’d completed each painting, a process that could take him several months, he would fling left over paint onto the canvases with a pallet knife. The chaotic streaks and splotches “activate” the paintings, he said, infusing them with energy. One of the paintings captures X González, a survivor of the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, as they deliver a poignant speech demanding change just days after the massacre. The painting has added resonance in the wake of yet another school shooting, which claimed the lives of 19 elementary schoolchildren and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas. “History Painting (London, 8 August 2011) ROYBWN” shows an unidentified masked protestor mid-stride against a backdrop of flames during an uprising sparked by the police shooting of Mark Duggan, a 29-year-old Black man, in Tottenham, London. Quinn’s interpretation of the image hangs opposite a 1782 portrait of Charles Stanhope, the third Earl of Harrington by Joshua Reynolds, underscoring the contrasts between the old master paintings and Quinn’s works. In Reynolds’ painting, an idealized Stanhope stands dressed in armor with his sword unsheathed and pointed to the ground. A column of black smoke rises in the background from a nearby battlefield. Marcus Richard Fitzroy Thomas, a young Black man who may have been attached to the earl’s regiment in Jamaica or enslaved on a plantation in the British colony, accompanies the young military officer. Stanhope likely brought Thomas back to Britain with him as his attendant, according to the museum label. Quinn’s nearly life-size depiction of Evans confronting the police officers is composed of four panels that don’t precisely line up with each other, creating a sense of the event unfolding in time, Droth said. A fourth painting documents a scene from anti-government unrest that erupted in Kyiv in 2014 after Ukraine’s then-president Viktor Yanukovych refused to sign an association agreement with the European Union, choosing instead to forge closer ties with Russia. The image, painted across three panels, flames and coal-black smoke surround two protestors. One crouches as the other hurls an object at an unseen foe. “History Painting (Kiev [Kyiv], 22 January 2014) YGORBW” is a photorealistic painting of a photograph taken of anti-government protestors during unrest in Kyiv, Ukraine, in 2014. Quinn flings paint on the canvas to activate his modern history paintings. “There is a lot of energy in this painting,” Droth said, addressing Quinn. “The paint that you’ve thrown on top of it seems to echo the motions, the flinging action, of the protestor.” Quinn noted that the 2014 clashes were a prelude to Vladimir Putin’s decision in February to invade Ukraine and the ongoing war there. “It’s incredible how historical events come to the fore, and then they go into the background, and they come to the fore again,” he said. The Yale Center for British Art is open Tuesdays through Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sundays from noon to 5 p.m. Visitor guidelines are posted on the museum’s website.
