Their current coverage may be sufficient for their travel needs. However, some trips warrant additional coverage. For example, France requires visitors to have medical evacuation and repatriation coverage in order to receive a work visa, and security evacuation coverage may be very important in some parts of the world. The current USG medical plans do not include all of these provisions. Travel insurance with basic ERS (evacuation, repatriation, and security) might be needed. In addition, some medical plans may have high deductibles or cumbersome reimbursement requirements when using out-of-plan providers. Therefore, a traveler may choose to supplement their existing regular medical insurance plan with more robust medical travel insurance. Consult this guide to determine which travel insurance is appropriate for you. Need Assistance? Visit ServiceNow to request support.
