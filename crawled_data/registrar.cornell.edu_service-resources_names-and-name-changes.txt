Cornell recognizes that many community members use a name other than their primary name and as a student, you are able to designate a preferred first and middle name. The Office of the University Registrar will strive to use preferred name on internal documents, in communications and, where appropriate and feasible, in information systems and reporting. Student Preferred Name Preferred name will appear in the Cornell University directory and in other University records and documents including class lists, grade rosters, and university ID cards. Some records, such as health and insurance or financial aid, require use of a legal name. Generally, you can set a preferred name to any name, but we reserve the right to delete a preferred name if it is inappropriate or offensive. A periodic review of preferred first and middle names will be conducted by the Office of the University Registrar to identify and remove inappropriate or offensive names. Making Changes to Preferred Name Students may set their preferred name at any time. To edit your preferred name: Visit Student Essentials Click on Update Preferred First Name Edit name and click Update Preferred Name Student Primary Name Primary name is used for official university business. Primary first, middle, and last names will be used for transcripts and diplomas, enrollment and degree certifications; for federal, state, and compliance reporting, and in other circumstances where primary name is necessary. NetIDs are generally composed of the initials of the student’s primary first, middle, and last name. View your primary name by logging into Student Essentials.
