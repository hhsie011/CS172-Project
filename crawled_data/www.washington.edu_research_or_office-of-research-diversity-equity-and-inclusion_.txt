President Ana Mari Cauce launched the University-wide Race and Equity Initiative in Spring 2015 with a challenge: that all of us — students, faculty, staff and university leadership — take personal responsibility for addressing our own biases and improving our institution’s culture of diversity. And it began with a commitment: that together we would combat the racism and inequities, both individual and institutional, that persist here and throughout our society. We continue to address her charge to “seize the day.” Executive Statement The Office of Research shares President Cauce’s commitment to combat inequities and racism. The values of diversity, equity and inclusion are integral to the success of our research enterprise and are embedded in the culture of who we are as an institution and employer. We will honor different and unique identities and nurture an accessible, welcoming and respectful environment for all staff, students and faculty in the Office of Research and for all members of the UW research community. We will regularly review our services and systems and adapt them to reflect the evolving environments and work styles of our employees and those we serve. We are ALL responsible for confronting bias and inequities, both individual and institutional, that persist here and throughout our society. Our call is to remove barriers and promote access, opportunity, and justice for all. We all must commit to this ongoing work. Recognizing and valuing diversity will make the Office of Research and the University stronger, and enrich the stellar research carried out at the UW. Guiding Principles regarding Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion The Office of Research is taking an active stance in this initiative to make effective changes in our own sphere of influence both as an organization and as individuals; we are responsible as members of the university and as individual members of our society for addressing these issues. The Office of Research shares the President’s commitment to combat racism and promote equity and we are actively advancing this commitment in the following ways: The Office of Research will support a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Recognizing and valuing all of our differences will not only make our office stronger and enhance our support for researchers; it will enrich the research carried out at the UW. We will honor diverse experiences and perspectives and nurture an accessible, welcoming and respectful environment for all Office of Research employees and for all researchers at the university. It will take all of us to turn the tide and create a culture that truly values diversity. This is a hard job. We are ALL responsible for modeling inclusivity, civility and respect. And we are all responsible for making the UW a supportive environment for all researchers and the work they do. DEI Areas of Focus for Action Inclusive hiring and promotion practices. We support and are implementing the practices outlined by Human Resources and the Office for Faculty Advancement. Jointly with the Office for Faculty Advancement, we provide resources for recruitment and retention of faculty who exemplify a commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion through their instruction, research, service and outreach. Communications and messages (including unit and research webpages) We are committed to inclusivity in all of our communications. We are currently undertaking a complete audit of all Office of Research web pages, viewing each through a DEI lens. Climate and culture As noted below, within the Office of Research, the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee is taking on the task of providing ongoing advice on enhancing our climate and culture. Throughout the coming year, we will work with academic units to support efforts to enhance the research climate and culture for everyone. Identifying funding resources We are collecting and disseminating information on funding for diversity initiatives available to PIs, postdocs, and graduate students. Office of Research Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee Led by Chair, Sarah Lambino Larson, this multi-unit team within the Office of Research staff is charged with providing ongoing input and ideas for how to foster increased Diversity, Equity and Inclusion within our Office of Research communities, and assessing progress towards a set of goals. This standing committee includes members from each of the Office of Research units: Office of Research Central, Applied Physics Laboratory, Human Subjects Division, Office of Animal Welfare, Office of Research Information Services, Office of Sponsored Programs, and the Washington National Primate Research Center. This team’s responsibilities include: Developing an executive statement of our commitment Providing recommendations, goals and a timeline for improving the climate of diversity, equity and inclusivity within the Office of Research Assessing progress towards the goals identified On an ongoing basis, developing annual goals and assessing progress towards those goals Diversity Funding Resources Startup Funds for Hiring DEI STEM Faculty DEI STEM Faculty Recruitment Initiative Startup funds to assist in hiring faculty at the UW Seattle campus. Funds are reserved for recruitment of faculty in the STEM disciplines (broadly defined) with a proven history of supporting and mentoring BIPOC students, post-docs, and/or early-career colleagues; conducting research that benefits underrepresented or underserved communities, and/or significantly participating in programs and activities that are aimed at increasing diversity and inclusion in their field Internal UW Graduate School fellowships The GO-MAP program in the Graduate School offers Fellowships and Awards for underrepresented graduate students. UW Seed Grants Small grants that support projects for institutional transformation across the University of Washington’s tri-campus community that align with the goals of the 2017-2021 UW Diversity Blueprint. Washington Sea Grant Keystone Fellowship program An annual award for individuals who are historically underrepresented in marine science, policy and related industry careers External NEW NSF funding opportunity: Mathematical & Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (MPS-Ascend) Support postdoctoral Fellows who will broaden the participation of groups that are underrepresented in MPS fields in the U.S. including Blacks or African Americans, Hispanics, Latinos, and Native Americans (to include Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians or other Native Pacific Islanders) as future leaders in MPS fields The program funds postdoctoral Fellows in postdoctoral research environments that will have maximal impact on their future scientific development and facilitates their transition into a faculty appointment. The program is intended to recognize beginning investigators of significant potential and provide them with experience in research that will broaden perspectives, facilitate interdisciplinary interactions and help broadening participation within MPS fields. Corporate and Foundation DEI Funding Opportunities Current open opportunities for DEI focused funding opportunities for which UW faculty, researchers and programs may be eligible NIH Diversity Supplements NIH provides supplemental funding to existing NIH grants to promote diversity of the research workforce, focused on faculty and trainees who have been traditionally underrepresented in health-related research: NIH Research Supplements to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research (PA-20-166). Materials from a recent workshop on applying for such supplements is available here, including a presentation from Lynn Morin from NIH. Burroughs Wellcome Post-doctoral Enrichment Program $20,000 per year for three years to provide enrichment activities for underrepresented minority postdocs engaged in biomedical or medical research. Eligibility: must have no more than 36 months of postdoctoral research experience (in a research laboratory) at the time of application and not be more than 5 years from the Ph.D. NSF INCLUDES seeks to improve collaborative efforts aimed at enhancing the preparation, increasing the participation, and ensuring the contributions of individuals from groups that have been historically underrepresented and underserved in the STEM enterprise. Resources for Undergraduate Research Summer Research Summer research programs provide opportunities for students to engage in immersive research experiences. URP helps students to plan for summer research, find programs, and apply to programs at UW and elsewhere. (See a URP adviser or attend a Summer Research Program Information Session.)
