Smith '94, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Vista Equity Partners, speaks with Darius Gant ’17 at the Columbia Black Business Students Association's ELEVATE conference on March 25, 2017. At Columbia Business School, we believe that diversity strengthens any community or business model and brings it greater success. That's why we're committed to promoting diversity in all its forms by making sure that those from different racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, gender, and professional backgrounds are represented in our community. Nowhere is this commitment more apparent than in MBA clusters and learning teams, which are designed to bring together students from a range of backgrounds to help them learn together, both about the material and one another. We are constantly finding ways to further promote diversity, particularly through our nearly 100 student organizations. These student-led groups provide opportunities throughout the semester for all students to celebrate the many different cultures present at Columbia Business School, and many are also involved in the career recruiting process and student-run conferences. The goal behind clubs affiliated with particular affinity groups is not only to provide a network of support for those students, but also to promote collaboration among clubs and across our community. For example, in spring 2014, the leaders of CWiB worked hand-in-hand with CBS faculty and administrators to produce a first-of-its-kind, student-led report that takes an introspective look at the Columbia Business School community across four dimensions—admissions, academics, community, and careers—and makes recommendations for how to build on the success of existing efforts. Columbia Business School is affiliated with a number of diversity focused programs and associations, including the Consortium for Graduate Study in Management, Management Leadership for Tomorrow, the National Black MBA Association, the National Society for Hispanic MBAs, the Riordan Fellows Program, Sponsors for Educational Opportunity, the Forté Foundation, Goldman Sachs' 10,000 Women, Reaching Out MBA, CHecK uS Out (a multi-school admissions event for LGBT prospective students that takes place in New York City and San Francisco each fall), the Yellow Ribbon Program, and the Ten School Diversity Alliance, a joint effort by the nation's leading business schools to affect and influence the diversity of MBA campuses, organization, and the global community. Consortium for Graduate Study in Management Columbia Business School is a proud member of the Consortium for Graduate Study in Management, an alliance of leading American business schools and some of our country’s top corporations. The Consortium's mission is to enhance diversity and inclusion in global business education and leadership by striving to reduce the significant underrepresentation of African Americans, Hispanic Americans and Native Americans in both member schools' enrollments and in the ranks of global management.
