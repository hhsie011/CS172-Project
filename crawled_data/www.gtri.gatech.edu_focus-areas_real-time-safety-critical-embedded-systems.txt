These systems take on multiple form factors incorporating real-time operating systems with one or more traditional processors, Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA’s), networking components, and custom-developed signal-conditioning hardware. Example delivered systems include: Fire unit Software-in-the-Loop models for soldier training Control of legacy analog waveform-based components using modern digital computer networks Adaptation of legacy weapon system components to next-generation weapon systems Miniaturization of legacy systems using modern components Have a question?
