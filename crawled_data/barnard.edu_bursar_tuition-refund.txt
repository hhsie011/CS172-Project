If you have excess funds (negative balance) in your student account, you may request a refund by submitting a Refund Request Form to the Office of the Bursar (via email to bursar@barnard.edu, fax (212) 853-7433, or in-person at 007 Milbank Hall (Monday-Friday, 10 am to 4 pm.) Refund Methods Direct Deposit is the fastest and most secure way for students to receive their refunds. By electing this option, students' refunds will be directly deposited into their U.S. checking account. Direct Deposit forms can be obtained and submitted to Office of the Bursar at bursar@barnard.edu. If the student selects direct deposit, all future refunds will direct deposited to the student account. If the student changes her bank account, the student must notify our office immediately If a student has not signed up for direct deposit, a check will be mailed to their campus mailbox. Credit balances resulting from a Parent Plus Loan will be issued as a check to the Plus Loan borrower. Payments made through Flywire or Western Union will be refunded through Flywire or Western Union by the original payment method/currency. Financial Aid Refunds A credit balance resulting from grant aid or a Federal Direct Stafford Loan is automatically generated and issued to the student. If your account is paid in full or in part by a Parent Plus Loan and it creates a credit balance, the refund check is issued to the borrower of the loan up to the amount of the PLUS Loan disbursement. Federal regulations require that any excess PLUS Loan funds be issued or refunded to the PLUS Loan borrower. However, the PLUS Loan borrower may submit a written authorization to transfer the credit of the PLUS Loan to the student. Written authorizations may be sent to the Office of the Bursar (via email at bursar@barnard.edu or via fax (212) 853-7433). An email is not a valid authorization. The authorizations are valid for one semester. Refund from a Monthly Payment Plan Students and families who have a credit balance as a result of the Monthly Payment Plan will not receive a refund until all monthly payments have been paid. However, the payer may reduce their plan through the Bursar Student Account Center. Leaves and Withdrawals A student incurs a legal obligation to pay tuition, fees, room, and board by registering for classes or completing a housing or meal plan application. Barnard's refund policy for withdrawals is as follows: Withdrawal Before Semester Start: If a student withdraws before the start of the semester and incurs no charges, any semester payments will be refunded except for her nonrefundable tuition deposit, which is forfeited. If the student has incurred any charges, the deposit is applied to those charges. Withdrawal During the Semester: If a student withdraws during the semester, her charges will be prorated (see Refund Formula below) if she has been enrolled for less than or equal to 60% of the term, and she completes the necessary forms with the Offices of the Dean of Studies (tuition and fees), Residential Life and Housing (complete the Housing Cancellation Form), and Bursar (meal plan cancellation). If a student has been enrolled for more than 60% of the term, she is not eligible for a reduction in charges. Depending on the date of official cancellation, withdrawal from housing may incur additional penalties; students should consult their housing contract and the Residential Life and Housing office policies. Please note that for the refund formula (noted below), the semester definition is inclusive of both parts A and B. Refund Formula: The refund formula measures the actual number of days enrolled during the semester. It is determined by dividing the number of days enrolled by the number of calendar days in the semester (including weekends and holidays and excluding spring break) and then deducting that calculation from 100%. For example, if there are 106 calendar days in a semester, and a student withdraws on the 50th day of the semester, her charges and financial aid will be prorated to reflect that she’s been enrolled for 52.8% of the semester [i.e., 1 minus (50 divided by 106)]. Study Abroad Refunds: Study Abroad has been canceled for the Fall 2021 semester. Recipients of Federal Title IV Funds: If a student is a recipient of Federal Title IV financial aid, refunds to those programs are required by federal regulation to be the first priority and must be returned in the following order: Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Federal Perkins Loan, Federal PLUS Loan, Federal Pell Grant, and Federal SEOG A student is not eligible for a refund until all Federal Title IV programs and other scholarships are reimbursed as required, and all outstanding balances with the College have been cleared. To request a refund, please submit a student refund request form to the Bursar’s office at bursar@barnard.edu. Fees Not Eligible for Refund The following items are not subject to the refund policy: Orientation fees Late fees (late payment, late registration, late enrollment verification, etc.) Deferred payment fees Returned check fees Dormitory fines Finance charges Tuition Refund Plan To protect your financial investment against the student's serious illness or accident resulting in the withdrawal of the student before a semester is completed, consider the Tuition Refund Plan. The Tuition Refund Plan is a private insurance program that supplements Barnard's refund policy for complete withdrawals. Subscribers are assured a refund throughout the term even though Barnard's refund policy may have expired at the time of withdrawal. An 80% refund applies to covered charges for medical withdrawals.
