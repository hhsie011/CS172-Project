Students who have previously earned a bachelor's degree or its equivalent are not eligible for admission to Dartmouth. Students who have taken college coursework that is counting towards their high school graduation must apply for first-year admission. This includes students pursuing an associate's degree while finishing high school. Students who are not currently enrolled in school, or whose education has been interrupted, may apply for admission and often use the "Additional Information" portion of the application to provide background on their experiences and their educational path. An applicant's anticipated year of graduation or the number of credits completed within the guidelines stated above will not have an impact on the outcome of an application. Because Dartmouth enrolls such a small number of transfer students each year, the Admissions Committee does not need to balance the numbers of students entering as new sophomores or juniors.
