Founded in 2004, Columbia University's student chapter follows this mission by working on sustainable engineering projects in Ghana, Morocco, and Uganda. The Ghana program, which started in 2004, currently focuses on water management in the farming community of Obodan and used to work in the semi-urban town of Sakyikrom. The Morocco program, which began in 2011, has been readying itself to travel for the first time during the Summer of 2011. In 2008, the Uganda program was established to install a Multi-Function Energy Platform in the Soroti region. Each project draws from the skills of its members to provide technical solutions to worldwide problems. Roles: Columbia Engineering undergrad students participate in outreach activities as well as participate in engineering projects to help underserved communities worldwide.
