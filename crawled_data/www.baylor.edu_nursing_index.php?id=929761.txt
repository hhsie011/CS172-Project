Work and Education Dr. Rossler joined Baylor University Louise Herrington School of Nursing in 2014 as an Assistant Professor. Dr. Rossler entered academia in 2006 as a Faculty Instructor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Her work history in nursing education also includes a position of Assistant Clinical Professor at Texas Woman’s University School of Nursing in Dallas, Texas and Assistant Professor at Armstrong State University College of Health Professions in Savannah, Georgia. Dr. Rossler has over 27 years of experience working and teaching in the critical care hospital setting. Research interests include the effectiveness of simulation-based teaching strategies on improving interprofessional education, transitioning of nursing and healthcare professionals into practice, and the impact of simulation on practice behaviors and patient care outcomes. Additionally, her research focuses on developing studies using immersive virtual reality-based and telehealth experiential learning. She is recognized as a Certified Healthcare Simulation Educator (CHSE) through the Society for Simulation in Healthcare and past 2016-2017 INACSL Research Fellow. Select Funded Research Dr. Rossler is a Co-PI for a National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering/National Institutes of Health-funded research project entitled Validation of an Immersive Virtual Reality-Based Experiential Learning Simulator to Improve Medication Administration Safety Skills of Registered Nurses (1 R03 EB026171-01A1) demonstrate my preparedness to Co-Lead this project. Select Publications Dr. Rossler’s current and emerging publications demonstrate her experience with incorporating simulation-based education within academia and the healthcare industry. These publications found how both undergraduate nursing and healthcare professions students benefit in the realms of self-confidence and satisfaction in learning, role socialization, effective communication, and interprofessional education when provided education with simulation teaching methodologies. These publications advance the science of simulation related to orienting newly licensed Registered Nurses into the hospital setting with simulation-based education. These publications also represent foundational research necessary for advancing innovative simulation teaching methodologies within academia and the healthcare industry to impact patient safety and care.
