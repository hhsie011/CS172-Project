Faculty from leading universities participated in a series of panels exploring technical issues relevant to today’s unprecedented environment. The conference explored aspects of statistical machine learning, deep learning and AI with an emphasis on tools and ideas that are relevant to systematic investing methodologies. Agenda Thursday, November 19, 2020 Agenda Leveraging COVID-19 data for quantitative forecasting 11:00 am – 12:30 pm EDT In these unprecedented times quantitative investors are asking what data are available for tracking the spread and impact of COVID-19, from different sources, issues about data curation and reliability, and issues that arise when developing meta-analysis of data from different sources for the purposes of forecasting and of identifying causal relations. Nicholas Christakis, Yale University David Madigan, Northeastern University Bin Yu, UC Berkeley Deep-learning & AI: Has the revolution happened yet? 12:30 pm – 2:00 pm EDT In Tech, Finance, and Big Pharma alike, techniques from machine learning, to artificial intelligence, to data science, promise to revolutionize how operations are run, forecasts are made, and vaccines discovered. Several CEOs have been warning the public about AI taking over the world. Despite all the hype, real results have been lagging. This panel will discuss a realistic role for techniques from machine learning to data science, and what we can expect they will bring in the near and distant future. David Donoho, Stanford University Michael Jordan, UC Berkeley Donald Rubin, Temple University and Harvard University Statistical machine learning tools and systematic investing 2:00 pm – 3:30 pm EDT A review of statistical and machine learning ideas and methodologies that promise to impact the practice of systematic investing.
