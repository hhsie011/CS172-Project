Travel Warnings Quick Links Travel Update: Human Trafficking Prevention Training Certification Beginning January 1, 2022, all in-state lodging providers must complete the Iowa Department of Public Safety’s Human Trafficking Prevention Training Certification to receive public funds for state employee lodging, conferences, meetings, banquets, or any state-funded event. This change will affect in-state travel for Iowa State University as well as the other Regents institutions. If your lodging provider is not certified, and state funding is being utilized, you will not be reimbursed for your expenses from that provider. Travelers should check with https://stophtiowa.org/certified-locations before booking travel arrangements. If your desired location is not listed on the website, please contact the location and request that they complete the training before your scheduled stay.
