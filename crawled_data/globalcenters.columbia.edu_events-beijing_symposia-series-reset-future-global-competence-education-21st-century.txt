This situation in turn leads to rising tensions between people from different communities, ethnicities, regions, standpoints, and interests, adding further momentum to the deglobalization trend. At such an unprecedented moment, global competence education becomes more important than ever before. The core purpose of global competence education is to equip the young generation with the skills and knowledge to appreciate and effectively engage with diverse societies and to meet the challenges of the 21st century and beyond. Reset the Future is a long-run thematic symposia series launched by Columbia Global Centers | Beijing. From September 2020 to February 2021, global education leaders, scholars, and social entrepreneurs will convene to discuss the role of educators in helping young people to develop global competence, and how global learning approaches can be integrated throughout science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics.

Session 2: Models of Global Competence Education in China, U.S., and Beyond This panel discussion will bring together experts and practitioners in this field within and outside the system to share and exchange practical insights from diverse background. Participants will discuss the challenges and opportunities faced by China, the U.S., and other countries in their respective stages in promoting global competence education, and explore the value and potential of cross-cultural, interdisciplinary art education in cultivating global competence. The discussion will focus on four major topics of the global competence education: developmental background, core elements, framework, and assessment criteria. Session 3: Curriculum Design for Global Competence This panel discussion will focus on innovations in global competence education for students of different age groups in various school systems.

Session 4: Preparing Globally Competent Teachers This panel discussion will focus on the global competence training for teachers and educators. Participants will discuss the specific reforms, implementations, and social resources that can be utilized to prepare globally competent teachers for different student age groups and academic disciplines. Session 5: Global Competence and Educational Equity This panel discussion will focus on the challenges and opportunities in developing global competence education in educational non-profits and the impact of globalization on education equity.

It will also explore the importance of arts and philanthropy education in global competence education.
