It all starts here. We know the authentic value of an education can’t be measured in dollars and cents. It’s in the ah-ha moments, the eurekas, the sweat and breakthroughs. It’s in the memory of a perfect spring afternoon and the lifelong friendship that began on a stroll through campus. It’s in the spiritual tranquility and confidence that come with discovering who you are and what you want to do. This is the kind of education Creighton delivers. We also give our graduates the knowledge and skills they need to stand out on the job market and thrive in their careers.
