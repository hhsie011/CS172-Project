Most annual permit holders will experience no change in their parking privileges or parking locations, and there are no permit rate increases during this renewal cycle. June expiring permit holders will have the opportunity to renew or request a different option when the annual renewal period opens on June 6. Commuters should examine their transportation options, especially if they require only limited, occasional access to campus. June Permit Renewal The Renewal Opportunity Begins June 6 Renewal for annual permits expiring in June opens on June 6, 2022. Permit holders are guaranteed a 2022-23 replacement permit if renewed by June 30, 2022. Daily Decision Parking Low-cost Parking Options Using ParkMobile The Daily Decision program gives commuters access to low-cost, short-term options to meet their occasional parking needs. Using the ParkMobile app, this program provides community members greater flexibility than a traditional annual or semester permit, coupled with the convenience of contactless self-service. Visit the Daily Decision page to learn more about parking options, prices, and locations, and visit ParkMobile.io to download the app, create an account, and park. Transportation Services manages the commuting, parking, and inter-campus travel demands of Cornell University. Services include Campus-to-Campus motorcoach travel; fleet car rentals and leasing for business-related needs; department-owned vehicle repair and detailing; and transit pass, parking, and compliance program administration.
