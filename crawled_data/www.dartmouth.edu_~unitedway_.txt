Give Local. Dartmouth's 2021 United Way Giving Campaign is Live! When the Dartmouth community unites to support its neighbors, incredible things happen. The Dartmouth community has been stepping up to support our neighbors in need since the early 1800's. We ask that you continue empowering our communities by volunteering and giving where you live. Whether you contribute time, funds, or items to individuals and families in need, it all makes a difference. Make your donation today This year marks the 50th anniversary of Dartmouth's partnership with the Granite United Way as a means to support the agencies and organizations that bring positive change to our neighbors in the Upper Valley. Contributions to the Granite United Way fund nonprofits to actively address the challenges faced by individuals and families in our Upper Valley community so our neighbors can learn, earn, and be healthy. Your generosity can offer invaluable support to local nonprofits as we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic; this will reconnect students in the classroom, provide pathways to financial recovery and stability, and support mental health for those who are struggling. Thank you to those who attended the Granite United Way football game and the Power of Community Kickoff Celebration!
