On This Page Foreign Study Programs Foreign Exchange Programs Foreign Exchange Information Study Abroad Questions? Foreign Study Programs Green City Program Berlin, Germany This program invites students to combine engineering coursework that focuses on “green” and sustainable engineering with a fast-track German course (GERM 2–3) that satisfies Dartmouth’s foreign language requirement. It is also open to students who already have German language skills beyond the beginner’s level. Learn More Summer Research Experience Helmut Schmidt University – Hamburg, Germany This program allows Dartmouth Engineering students to spend eight-weeks in Summer conducting research in a professor's lab at Helmut Schmidt University (HSU) in return for a small stipend. To qualify, students need to be advanced in their engineering coursework, which typically restricts applicants to being rising seniors or, rising 5th-year BE students. Learn More Foreign Exchange Programs We offer the following international exchange programs designed for undergraduate engineering students. Thailand Chulalongkorn University – Chula Learn More Hong Kong Chinese University of Hong Kong – CUHK Learn More Denmark Technical University of Denmark – DTU Learn More New Zealand University of Auckland Learn More Foreign Exchange Information Three students from each exchange university change place with students from Dartmouth. Though not a specific requirement, these exchanges are best suited for engineering majors. Declare your major as soon as possible the start of your 5th term in residence. This will allow you to receive engineering emails and receive course priority through the course election system for ENGS courses. Eligibility The program is designed for third-year undergraduate students (juniors) from Dartmouth and for 3rd or 4th year students from exchange universities/colleges. Deadline Applications for the current academic year are due at the Guarini Institute for International Education by February 1 Participating students are selected by early March. Admission These exchange programs are administered through Dartmouth's Guarini Institute for International Education. Applications are from second-year students who wish to participate in their junior year. Senior year participation may be possible, but only with the approval of the Registrar and the Engineering Sciences Department (Chair: Professor Van Citters). Selected students must be Engineering Sciences majors or modified majors by the time they enter the exchange program. Transfer students are not eligible. Applicants must have an overall grade point average of or equivalent to 3.0 or higher. Exceptions may be made only with the written consent of the host institution. Dartmouth students must submit a student exchange application along with recommendations from two Dartmouth faculty members, one of whom must be a Thayer School faculty member. Student Life All courses taken by exchange students at each institution are taught in English. Dartmouth students have the opportunity to study the language of their host country while on exchange, but knowledge of these languages is not required for participation in the program. Exchange students are given access to the full range of services normally available to foreign students regularly enrolled at the host institution. These include adequate orientation, an appointed qualified academic advisor, and access to library, computer, and recreational facilities. Orientation sessions both at their home institutions, and upon arrival at the host institution, cover academic expectations, administrative and logistical details, health and safety issues, and cultural awareness. Courses Requirements At least four courses: Four engineering courses in English Option to take an additional non-transferrable course including languages - Chula: Thai language course, non-credit “survival Thai” 2hrs/wk for 5 wks - CUHK: any Chinese language course available to International students - DTU: a three-week intensive Danish language and cultural course and free Danish language course during the semester Transfer Credit Transfer up to four course credits to Dartmouth: Need a grade of at least C and the course must have been approved beforehand (term prior to enrollment) Four courses toward A.B. degree requirements Two courses used for credit towards Engineering Sciences major Up to four courses can be used in satisfaction of Bachelor of Engineering degree requirements Visa & Health Insurance Need passport valid for at least three months past the end of exchange All exchange schools will provide necessary documentation for visa (small fees may apply) Student responsible for obtaining necessary visa Must be covered by health insurance (i.e. Dartmouth Student Health Insurance Plan) Travel & Housing Travel arrangements are the responsibility of each exchange student. The host institution typically assumes responsibility for facilitating housing, generally in an on-campus residential dormitory or in a nearby apartment, but the student is responsible for the housing costs. Finances & Expenses Participating students pay normal tuition to their home institution. Neither institution charges their exchange students for any tuition or application fees, but fees at the host institution may apply for administrative, housing, or student services related fees. Room, board, travel and insurance are the financial responsibility of the exchange student. As an official Dartmouth exchange program, any pre-existing scholarship aid continues during the exchange. Financial aid is available for official exchange programs arranged through the College. Students receive no more scholarship assistance than they would have received for a term at Dartmouth. Any extra costs associated with the program will be covered by additional loan assistance. If a student withdraws early, the withdrawal and refund policies of the student's home institution apply. View each foreign exchange page, listed above, to see estimated expenses. Study Abroad Questions?
