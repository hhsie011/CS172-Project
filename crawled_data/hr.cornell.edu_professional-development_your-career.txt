Think of it as something you own, to be personalized to your life and your needs. You deserve to feel engaged at work. You deserve to feel as though you “fit” – or belong – in your role, in your department, and at Cornell. Occupational wellbeing can be cultivated, just as one develops and strengthens their physical, mental, or financial health. Eighty percent of your career fit is defined and driven by you. It should be based on your values, needs, current situation, and where you hope to be in the future. And as with any muscle or habit, it is best strengthened through consistent, focused attention. This doesn’t mean, though, that all employees are expected to be on the same career path. Nor can we be. Some people are our talent who love what they’re doing right now, and will serve as a stable foundation for the university as they grow and develop in their current role. Other employees are on a steeper career trajectory, looking for new and different opportunities around every corner. Both types are needed for success in a stable, innovative environment. What about the other 20 percent? The university is dedicated to creating an environment conducive to growth and development. One in which our talent, on all trajectories, are empowered and properly equipped to manage their career. That is our 10 percent. The final 10 percent of the career management equation is in the hands of our supervisors, who are charged with supporting you in the exploration of resources and opportunities to reach your full potential.
