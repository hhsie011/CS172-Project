Timely Warnings, also called "Crime Alerts," are provided to enhance the safety of the community by giving students, faculty and staff notification of crimes that occur on or nearby campus property, and are considered by the Department of Public Safety to present a serious or continuing threat to students and employees. These Crime Alerts are issued in compliance with federal law, specifically the Clery Act, for selected crimes in selected locations. They do not present, nor are they intended to present, a complete picture of crime on campus. Timely Warning Policy The Columbia University Department of Public Safety is responsible for preparing and issuing a Crime Alert whenever a crime that is reported to them represents a continuing threat to students and employees. Information for alerts may also come from information supplied to Public Safety by the NYPD. Crime Alerts can also seek information from community members that may lead to the arrest and conviction of an offender and usually contain crime prevention tips and safety information. Pictures of suspects, rather than verbal descriptions are included in crime alerts whenever available. When enough details about the incident are known, Public Safety will prepare and distribute an alert to the entire community, via the mass notification e-mail system. Alerts may also be posted on campus bulletin boards and in Columbia owned buildings throughout the community. Timely Warning Procedure The Columbia University Department of Public Safety will prepare a Crime Alert whenever a report is received of a crime against a person or property that represents a continuing threat to students, faculty and staff. Notices may be issued for such crimes that occur on campus property, non-campus property, or on public property immediately adjacent to or accessible from campus. Crime Alerts provide details of the crime, a description of the suspect if known, or a picture instead, if one is available, information on whom to contact about the investigation, and often, crime prevention tips. Information included in Crime Alerts: A succinct statement of the incident. Possible connection to previous incidents, if applicable. Photo of the suspect, if available. Physical description of the suspect, if no photo is available. Date the bulletin was released. Other relevant and important information about the crime(s). Information on Crime Prevention, personal safety or other community safety resources. Crime Alerts may be updated if new or more accurate information becomes available during the course of the investigation. Crime Alerts are distributed by mass e-mail notifications sent to all columbia.edu e-mail addresses. These e-mails are approved by the Vice President of Public Safety or his designee and are distributed by the Department of Public Safety.
