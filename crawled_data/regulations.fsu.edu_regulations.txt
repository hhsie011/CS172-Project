The collection of Florida State University Regulations is the basic governing code of the university and has legal status under the law. They are subject only to the applicable local, state and federal laws and to the Regulations of the Florida Board of Governors. Florida Statutes and Board of Governors Regulations provide that certain specific subject matters must be addressed by Regulation. Others subject matters are addressed in Regulation by choice as having impact on parties and interests outside the university community or as affecting the important substantive rights of members of the university community. Definitions Regulations : As defined by the BOG, regulations are statements of general applicability to guide the conduct or action of constituents or the public, adopted by the university boards of trustees that implement its powers and duties. Regulations must be consistent with law and with the resolutions and strategic plan of the Board of Governors. Regulations do not include the following: Internal management memoranda, which are defined as statements that do not affect the private interests of any person and which have no application outside the state university system; Legal memoranda, opinions and guidelines; Preparation of the state university system or a university’s budget; Negotiated contractual provisions, including those reached as a result of collective bargaining; Curriculum and other academic requirements. This definition is consistent with that for “rules” contained in the Florida Administrative Code, Chapter 120, Florida Statutes. Select Regulations : Select Regulations are regulations that pertain to student tuition and fees, admissions, and articulation. Such regulations adopted by the individual boards of trustees also require approval by the Board of Governors.
