There are two options for dental insurance, the basic plan and the enhanced plan, which includes adult orthodontia. You may visit any dentist, however, out-of pocket expense is less with greater savings when utilizing an in-network provider. Remember, when visiting an out-of-network provider you will be responsible for charges above the in-network covered benefit allowance by the MetLife plan. 2022 Dental Plan Rates View the full-time and part-time dental rates View our retiree dental rates Know what your plan covers Your Dental Benefits Summary describes in detail your MetLife benefits and the differences between the Basic and Enhanced Dental Plans.
