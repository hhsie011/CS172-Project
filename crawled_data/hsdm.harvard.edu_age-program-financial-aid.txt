While the cost of dental education has risen steadily in recent years, a dental student can make responsible choices to finance his or her education. At the Harvard School of Dental Medicine (HSDM) we realize the complex terms and conditions of loans and financial aid policies can be confusing. We have developed the Financial Aid Handbook, which is designed to help familiarize you with our policies, to explain how you can apply for financial aid at Harvard School of Dental Medicine and to help you develop a strategy for financing this undertaking before dental school begins. 2022-23 HSDM AGE Financial Aid Manual At the Harvard School of Dental Medicine, we make every effort to assist you and your family in making a Harvard University dental education a reality for you.
