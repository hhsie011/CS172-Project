Joint Program Master of Business Administration/Master of Engineering Application Process Applicants must complete two separate applications, both of which are located in the Graduate School website. Applicants may submit applications in any order. Your transcripts and letters of recommendation can be used for both applications. MBA application ME application Requirements of MBA/ME Program Candidates for the joint Master of Engineering/MBA degree must complete 37 hours for MBA and 15 core engineering hours. In addition, the student must complete an additional 15 hours of electives. By proper selection of electives, it may be possible to reduce the requirements of the joint degree by up to 21 hours compared to the normal requirements of the two degrees completed separately. This efficiency is achieved by proper selection of business electives for the 15 business course credits allowed for the Master of Engineering program and by a six-credit reduction of the MBA elective requirements reflecting recognition of the additional graduate work in completing the Master of Engineering. Since both degrees are awarded simultaneously, all requirements in both programs must be completed in order to receive either degree. Students are encouraged to contact appropriate advisors in each program for further details. Students may choose to start with either the MBA or ME program, but they do not take classes for both programs simultaneously. Students must start the MBA program in the summer semester. Grades for courses in both programs are recorded on the same transcript from Baylor's Graduate School. Scholarship Opportunities Each school has different criteria for admission and scholarships. It is possible to be accepted into one program and not the other. Likewise, it is possible to receive a full scholarship from one school and not the other school.
