What to Look for: Check all currently owned videos for captioning. Self-recorded videos will need to be checked by viewing clips from each video with the captioning capabilities of the TV or projector turned on. Captioned TV programs/movies retain captioning when recorded. Mark the captioned videos with one of the captioning symbols for future reference. When purchasing new videos, buy captioned. If captioning status is not listed in the catalog or internet ordering site, contact the company. Test the media in your classroom at least 2 weeks before the schedule class showing to ensure all technical components are in working order. As an alternative, provide a transcript of video to the student and interpreter at least one class period in advance of the class showing. Purchased videos will be labeled with one of these three symbols on either the case or center label of the video.
