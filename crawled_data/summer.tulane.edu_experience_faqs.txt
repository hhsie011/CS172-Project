PRE-COLLEGE Frequently Asked Questions The Tulane Pre-College office is open from 8:30 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. Central Time Monday - Friday. You can reach us at summer@tulane.edu or (504) 314-7619. Program FAQ Who can attend the Pre-College Summer Programs? Tulane Pre-College accepts students entering the 6th through 12th-grade for our enrichment courses. College credit courses are open to rising juniors and seniors. Why are some of the Pre-College Summer Program courses "non-credit?" Our noncredit enrichment courses allow middle and high school students the experience of exploring college-level academic subjects without the pressure of exams and grades. Students who successfully complete an enrichment course receive a certificate of completion. Will there be homework outside of class? Credit-bearing courses are designed to mirror Tulane undergraduate courses and have assignments outside of class. The amount of daily homework varies among courses and may take up to several hours per day, but previous pre-college students have found these assignments manageable and rewarding. Most enrichment courses do not require students to complete additional work outside of class, although Newcomb Summer Session may require reading outside of class. What is a typical pre-college academic day like? Students attend class in the morning and afternoon with a break for lunch in between. College credit courses consist of class lectures in the morning and lab/studio in the afternoon. College workshops are offered before classes for credit-bearing students. Enrichment courses often include weekly field excursions related to the academic content of the course. What is the university's policy regarding participants with disabilities? It is our goal to offer universally accessible programming. If you anticipate needing any type of reasonable accommodation or have questions about accessibility, please contact our office at 504-314-7619 or summer@tulane.edu in advance of your participation or visit. How do I order a transcript? The Tulane University Registrar's Office maintains the official records & transcripts for Tulane University. Pre-college alumni may order electronic and/or mailed transcripts through the Order a Transcript page on the registrar's website. Students & alumni wishing to pick-up transcripts personally may do so at the Office of the Registrar, 110 Gibson Hall. Application FAQ Do I need to complete and submit any documents or letters of recommendation in order to be accepted into a Pre-College Summer Program? All students who wish to apply will need to complete an online application starter in order to access the student application portal.
