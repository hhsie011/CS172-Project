Over the last few weeks, we have brought home students who were studying abroad in Italy, and we are in the process of bringing back the remainder of the students who were studying abroad in other countries. On March 9, 2020, we announced cancellation of all university-sponsored spring break study abroad trips. As of today (March 16, 2020), we are canceling all Maymester and Summer 2020 study abroad programs. The University will refund student deposits for canceled study abroad trips through their student account. Reimbursements for prepaid expenses such as airline change fees, cancellation penalties, and lost travel-related deposits will be reimbursed through the TTU travel system. Students should cancel any remaining reservations as soon as possible in order to obtain possible refunds and/or unused airfare credits. The Office of International Affairs (OIA) will assist students in processing refunds and reimbursements - please direct all your questions to OIA's Study Abroad unit (studyabroad@ttu.edu). Thanks for your cooperation and patience in working with us through these challenging times. Sincerely, Sukant Misra Vice Provost for International Affairs Micheal Galyean Provost and Sr. Vice President Box 45004 | Lubbock, TX 79409-5004 | T 806.742.3667 | F 806.742.1286 | www.iaff.ttu.edu An EEO/Affirmative Action Institution Office of Communications & Marketing Address 2625 Memorial Circle, Administration 212, Lubbock, TX 79409 Phone 806.742.2136 Email webmaster@ttu.edu Texas Tech University 2500 Broadway Lubbock, Texas 79409 806.742.2011 Follow Texas Tech University Like Texas Tech University on FacebookLike Texas Tech University on Facebook Follow Texas Tech University on twitterFollow Texas Tech University on twitter Check in with Texas Tech University on FourSquareCheck in with Texas Tech University on FourSquare Subscribe to Texas Tech University on YouTubeSubscribe to Texas Tech University on YouTube Follow Texas Tech University on FlickrFollow Texas Tech University on Flickr Follow Texas Tech University on InstagramFollow Texas Tech University on Instagram Connect with Texas Tech University on LinkedInConnect with Texas Tech University on LinkedIn Contact Texas Tech UniversityContact Texas Tech University Contact Us Campus Map Jobs @ TTU Emergency Communication Center General Policy Information Public Access to Course Info Energy Management Mental Health Resources Title IX Fraud and Misconduct Hotline Online Institutional Resumes TTU System TTU Health Sciences Center TTUHSC El Paso Angelo State University Midwestern State University Statewide Search State of Texas Texas Homeland Security Texas Veterans Portal Texas CREWS SAO Fraud Reporting Open Records Requests Â© 2022 Texas Tech UniversityMar 20, 2020 2:55 PM Office of Communications & Marketing Marketing Office of Communications & Marketing Marketing Back Identity Guidelines Official Logos Communications Office of Communications & Marketing Communications Back News Office of Communications & Marketing Communications Back Texas Tech Today Monthly e-Newsletter Event Announcements A List Emergency Office of Communications & Marketing Communications Back Emergency Communications Center General Emergency Procedures Social Media Office of Communications & Marketing Communications Back YouTube Facebook Twitter Foursquare Flickr LinkedIn Wikipedia Experts Guide Office of Communications & Marketing Communications Experts Guide Back Experts Guide About Office of Communications & Marketing Back Staff Work With Us Additional Resources TTU HomeDirectory Raiderlink A-Z Index
