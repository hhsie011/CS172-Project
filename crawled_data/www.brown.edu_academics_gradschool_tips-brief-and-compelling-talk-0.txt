Strive to capture the complexity of your work in terms that we can all understand. Rehearse. Work in stages: develop your content with a written script that you hone into a strong performance. Be sure to practice in front of friends and peers. Solicit feedback on content, visuals, timing, performance, clarity, and impact.
