Global Roadmap for Healthy Longevity Report Release Webinar June 3, 2022 | 10:00 a.m. - 11:00 a.m. ET Registration Required Join the National Academy of Medicine on June 3, 2022 from 10:00 am to 11:00 am ET to discuss findings and recommendations from the newly released consensus study, titled Global Roadmap for Healthy Longevity. The report charts key recommendations across sectors that promote and advance healthy longevity across the life course. These policies, socioeconomic infrastructure improvements, and innovations have the potential to set societies on the path to provide a healthier, more fulfilling, and productive lives from birth to death. Changes will give individuals the ability and opportunity to live life with dignity, meaning, and purpose, and contribute to societal well-being on a scale that previous generations could not have imagined. This global public workshop will convene members of the international, independent commission of experts behind these recommendations to share a comprehensive, evidence-based overview of the roadmap designed to improve the health, productivity, and quality of life for people of all ages around the world by 2050. Linda P. Fried, MD, MPH, Dean of the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health, is the co-chair on the Comission for a Global Roadmap for Healthy Longevity.
