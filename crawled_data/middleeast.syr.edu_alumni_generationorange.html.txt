However, with the help of the scholarship, this dream came to reality,” he says. Nour earned his MBA and currently works as a senior specialist in the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates. Recalling his college days, he said it had a great influence on his life, “SU has a lot to offer, from embracing diversity to quality education. It also keeps a close eye to international students by the rich programs and events held by its international center, which makes you feel just at home away from home”. As an alumnus, Nour is an active member of the UAE Alumni Chapter. Nour added, “I truly believe good education is a right for everyone, however, in order to make our world a better place, we really have to help in educating the less fortunate in any way we can, and one way to do this is through scholarships”.
