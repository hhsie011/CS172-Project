Requests for Research Consortium Data Sets History The Research Consortium of Counseling and Psychological Services in Higher Education was founded in 1990 under the leadership of David Drum, Ph.D. and Augustine Baron, Psy.D. of the UT Counseling and Mental Health Center. An interim steering committee of 10 university counseling center directors met in Austin in March, 1990 to design the structure of the consortium and the first study to be conducted. Subsequently, an additional 22 centers were recruited for the first study based on regional representation and each director's expressed interest in research endeavors. In the most recent study, 70 colleges and universities participated in the study. To-date, five projects have been completed.
