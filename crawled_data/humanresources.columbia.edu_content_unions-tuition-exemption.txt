Expand all Collapse all Tax Treatment Graduate-Level Studies Description According to IRS guidelines, tuition exemption benefits for graduate-level studies (course numbers 4000 & above) are exempt from taxation up to the federal limit of $5,250 in a calendar year. The value of tuition exemption benefits above the federal limit of $5,250 is treated as taxable imputed income, and taxes will be withheld from your paycheck. The University will spread the tax liability of Tuition Exemption benefits for fall classes over the October through December pay periods. The one exception to this IRS guideline is for graduate-level studies certified as “job-related,” per IRS-defined criteria. See guidelines on whether you qualify for the Job-Related tax exemption and for employee and supervisor instructions on how to certify. Job-Related Graduate Education Certification Forms Due to the impact of Covid-19, new Job-Related forms must be submitted by your Supervisor to [email protected], confirming it has been signed and certified as job-related per the IRS criteria reflected in the policy. Non-Degree Programs – New forms must be certified and submitted each term. Degree Programs – Forms must only be certified once (unless you change your degree program, or job); however, a copy of the supervisor-certified form must be submitted each term. Note: Forms must be submitted by the end date of the Change of Program End Period. Important: If you do not submit a Job-Related Graduate Education Certification Form demonstrating these courses are related to your work at the University, your paycheck will be taxed for the tuition value of courses exceeding the annual federal limit.
