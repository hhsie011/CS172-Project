Regardless of one’s passions – whether history, religion, politics, culture, literature, modern media, philosophy or practices of everyday life – the Middle East is an ideal site for considering the diversity and complexity of the human experience. Undergraduate Course Listing A growing number of exciting courses, creative and relevant programming, and a steady stream of post-docs and visiting professors offer unparalleled opportunities for MES concentrators who wish to understand this region and to engage with a broad range of issues that affect our world. Awards & Opportunities Each year, Middle East Studies offers research travel awards to both undergraduates and graduate students, and posts announcements to external opportunities. DUG A Departmental Undergraduate Group (DUG) is a group of concentrators who meet regularly and plan programming in tandem with faculty that aims to create a sense of community within an academic department. Resources Brown's curriculum emphasizes individual freedom but that doesn't mean you have to navigate through your years at Brown all by yourself. Faculty advisors, deans, administrators, and even your peers are devoted to helping you during your college experience. However, it is up to you to take the first step and reach out to these resources! Honors Thesis Students graduate with Honors in Middle East Studies by completing an undergraduate Honors thesis under the supervision of a primary reader drawn from the Middle East Studies faculty and one additional reader from the Brown or Brown-affiliated faculty.
