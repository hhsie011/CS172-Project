Close Stronger TUgether: COVID-19 RESOURCES Home /Admission & Aid /Visit and Connect Visit and Connect Trust us, you want to visit campus. We’ll go ahead and tell you our secret—Tulane’s campus is stunning. Historical architecture, majestic oak trees, vibrant blooms and blue skies are just a few of the reasons we love coming here every day. Walk, bike, or take the streetcar (not to be confused with a trolley) down the majestic St. Charles Avenue to the heart of campus located in Uptown New Orleans. With tours year-round, one of our guides will be sure to show you the ropes. Did we mention that you also get to explore our great city while you’re here? Take a walk around Audubon Park, eat a po-boy for lunch (our favorite: a shrimp and oyster combo), dance in the street to a brass band, explore the French Quarter and experience everything New Orleans has to offer. We’ll see you in New Orleans!
