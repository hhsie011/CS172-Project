The Baylor School of Education (SOE) and Campus Living & Learning (CLL) have announced an expansion of their partnership in providing residential academic initiatives to Baylor students. The SOE’s Impact Living-Learning Center (LLC) and the LEAD LLC will join forces to form the IMPACT & LEAD LLC, which will be located in Allen and Dawson residence halls. Student residents will participate in renaming the LLC during the 2022-23 academic year. The SOE’s Impact LLC started in 2015 in South Russell Residence Hall, near the school’s home in Marrs McLean Science Building, and has always served both education majors and other students. The LEAD LLC, launched in 2004, is also multi-disciplinary and all of its residents take a leadership course taught by the School of Education’s Department of Educational Leadership through its leadership minor program. This new partnership will strengthen the academic bond between the LLC students and the SOE. Dr. Ryan W. Erck, program director of the Impact LLC since 2019, said the expansion will offer new and innovative opportunities. “While the new LLC will be a change of physical space for Impact, it will more strategically align the School of Education with its residential academic initiatives, encouraging students to grow, serve, lead, and educate together while living on campus,” Erck said. “Both LLC communities hold similar values and attract students who are interested in making a positive impact on the world.” The new IMPACT & LEAD LLC will continue to be multidisciplinary while retaining an emphasis on the value of education. Students pursuing fields ranging from statistics and chemistry to English and history are welcome to join in exploring what it means to lead, educate, and serve across the disciplines. Erck will continue to serve the SOE as program director of the IMPACT & LEAD LLC. Dr. Mona Choucair, who has served the Impact LLC as faculty in residence (FIR) since its inception, will remain in that role for South Russell Hall, which will become a first-year experience hall for new students. Dr. Beth Allison Barr, professor of history and associate dean in the Graduate School, will serve as the FIR for the new IMPACT & LEAD LLC. In alignment with Baylor’s mission to “educate men and women for worldwide leadership and service by integrating academic excellence and Christian commitment within a caring community,” this newly formed LLC will embody the goals of the School of Education, Campus Living & Learning in the Division of Student Life, and the Baylor campus as a whole. __________________________________________ For more news from Baylor School of Education, visit the Instant Impact home page.
