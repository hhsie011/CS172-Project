The Undergraduate Curriculum Committee of the Department which is staffed by faculty members formulates and monitors the curriculum, solicits suggestions and critiques from students. Every student in the Department is asked to fill out a course evaluation form for each course at the end of each semester. These evaluations, which do not have to be signed, are used to monitor the material and teaching in the Department's offerings.
