We're here to help. For quick reference, we’ve compiled the answers to our Frequently Asked Questions. Frequently Asked Questions Is there funding for summer programs? Yes Test FAQ Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. If I do not apply for aid my first year and my family circumstances change later, can I request aid after my first year? Yes. Students can apply for aid at any point during their time at Princeton. An explanation of the change in circumstances may be required. o I have to maintain a minimum GPA to remain eligible for financial aid? There is no minimum GPA requirement to remain on financial aid, but students must continue to maintain satisfactory academic progress. Will I receive the same amount of financial aid every year? It is our policy to meet every student’s full demonstrated need each year. Award amounts may vary from year to year, based on changes in a family's financial circumstances and Princeton's cost of attendance. Do I need to reapply for financial aid each year? For each year of attendance at Princeton, students must submit a new financial aid application. The application is evaluated according to the same need-based guidelines that were in effect when the student was admitted. Is it true that eating clubs for juniors and seniors are too expensive for aid students to join? The meal allowance included in the aid packages of juniors and seniors is based on the approximate average cost of an eating club board plan. This policy provides access to a variety of dining options for all aid students, including the eating clubs. Can I use financial aid to study abroad? Aid students who receive approval from the Office of International Programs for a semester or year abroad will be eligible for funding based on the cost of the program and amount of their family contribution. Princeton sponsored summer programs are not included since they have their own funds to support student costs. What does it cost to attend Princeton for a year? The cost of attendance at Princeton includes tuition, room, board, books and personal expenses. Review the most current cost of attendance. What if I win an outside scholarship? Outside scholarships from private sources are used to reduce the campus job and summer savings portions of the aid package. Once the earnings amounts are fully replaced, the Princeton grant is reduced to make room for the remaining scholarship in the award. Students can then use the amount of reduced scholarship toward the one-time purchase of a personal computer up to a pre-set amount by the financial aid office. Learn more about how outside scholarships impact the financial aid award in the Undergraduate Financial Aid Information and Application Instructions, available on the Apply for Financial Aid page. What is the Federal Work-Study Program (FWSP)? Federal Work-Study is a form of federal aid which pays student wages. Is it easy to find a student job on or near campus? Our Student Employment site is continuously updated with available jobs, making it easy for students to find employment opportunities both on and off campus. If my aid award includes a campus job, how many hours per week will I work? We typically expect first-year students to work 9 hours per week, which allows them ample time for studies and extracurricular activities. If I qualify for aid, how much assistance will I receive? At Princeton, we are committed to meeting 100 percent of the calculated need of each aid applicant based on an individual evaluation by a financial aid counselor. We make this determination using the information you provide on your financial aid application.

For students who choose to borrow, the average total indebtedness is about $8,500. Does the “no loan” policy mean I would not be allowed to borrow if I wanted to take out a student loan? Loans are available, and some students request an optional education loan to replace a shortfall in the expected student earnings (term-time job or summer employment) or cover expenses not included in the standard student budget. Learn more about financing options. Will I need to take out loans? More than 15 years ago, Princeton eliminated student loans from financial aid awards, replacing them with grants. Since then, no Princeton student has been required to borrow as part of a basic aid package. 84% of recent Princeton seniors graduated debt free. What kinds of funds will be included in my aid award?
