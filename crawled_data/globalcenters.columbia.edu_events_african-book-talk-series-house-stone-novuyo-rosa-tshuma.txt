With this series, we hope to offer a platform where African writers can engage a global audience, offering not just their work, but exciting perspectives on how personal, political, and cultural experiences drive their storytelling. Our fourth book in this series is "House of Stone" by Novuyo Rosa Tshuma, which is a story about the chronic turmoil of modern Zimbabwe whereby Abednego and Agnes Mlambo's teenage son, Bukhosi, went missing, and the Mlambos feared the worst... House of Stone is a sweeping epic that spans the fall of Rhodesia through Zimbabwe's turbulent beginnings, exploring the persistence of the oppressed in a young nation seeking an identity, but built on forgetting.
