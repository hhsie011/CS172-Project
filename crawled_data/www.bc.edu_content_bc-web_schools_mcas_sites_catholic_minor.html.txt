Since Catholicism comprises more than a religious institution, a set of moral or ritual practices, a body of doctrines, or individual and communal experiences, no one discipline or several disciplines functioning separately can properly understand it from the vantage point of its lived experience as a culture. The Catholic Studies minor seeks to provide students with the opportunity to explore the Catholic intellectual tradition, emphasizing the richness of its philosophical and theological systems, its artistic and cultural expressions, its historical evolution (including internal and external moments of contestation), its approaches to social analysis and the natural sciences, in order to appreciate the vision and values which emerge from this tradition.
