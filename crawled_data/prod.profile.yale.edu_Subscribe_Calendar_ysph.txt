Surveillance data suggest over one in five (21.6%) MSM in Malaysia are li ving with HIV. Contributing to this epidemic is the low uptake of HIV test ing and pre-exposure prophylaxis among Malaysian MSM. Technology-based app roaches\, such as chatbots\, are innovative strategies for improving linka ge to HIV testing and prevention services. In this session\, we will intro duce a culturally-tailored chatbot that was developed to increase HIV test ing and prevention among MSM in Malaysia. The facilitators and barriers to MSM's acceptance of chatbots and their preferred features will be introdu ced.\n\nSpeakers:\nZhao Ni\; Jeffrey Wickersham\n\nAdmission:\nFree\n\nDet ails URL:\nhttps://medicine.yale.edu/event/cira-talk-developing-a-chatbot- to-promote-hiv-testing-and-prevention/\n DTEND;TZID=Eastern Standard Time:20220602T100000 DTSTAMP:20220601T184010Z DTSTART;TZID=Eastern Standard Time:20220602T090000 LOCATION:URL: https://bit.ly/3KKL3MI SEQUENCE:0 STATUS:Confirmed SUMMARY:CIRA Talk: "Developing a Chatbot to Promote HIV Testing and Prevent ion" UID:52a50f78-b1b0-45b9-82d4-398d34f4359d END:VEVENT BEGIN:VEVENT DESCRIPTION:High HIV transmission continues to impact people who inject dru gs (PWID) and other people who use substances in many regions across the c ountry. HIV pre‐and post‐exposure prophylaxis (PrEP\, PEP) and medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are potent biomedical HIV‐prevention tools yet remain underutilized. Low‐threshold\, on‐demand models are needed to deliver evidence‐based services to those at highest risk. This talk will d escribe experiences with the implementation and delivery of HIV PEP/PrEPan d MOUD in Faster Paths\, the low‐barrier substance use disorder bridge cli nic at Boston Medical Center in Boston\, MA. We will discuss the strategie s including a standardized intake laboratory panel\, changes to our provid er note template to augment PEP/PrEPdecision support\, and the launch of p oint‐of‐care HIV rapid testing to facilitate screening for people who decl ine phlebotomy and will review data on PEP/PrEPoffers and uptake in our pr ogram. We also discuss implementation of "72‐hour‐rule methadone" administ ration for opioid withdrawal management paired with rapid referral to loca l opioid treatment programs. Preliminary data suggest that "72‐hour rule m ethadone" has been successful in engaging patients at very high risk of HI V (e.g.\, over 1 in 7 of the first 142 patients treated had known HIV infe ction)\, and that it has been associated with high rates of successful OTP linkage (87%) and 1‐month retention (58%).\n\nSpeakers:\nE.

Discussion topics include\, but are no t limited to: logistics\, data management\, analysis\, dissemination\, rol e of the researcher\, and ethics. It is intended as a venue for discussing research in progress and new or relevant literature on qualitative method s and practice as well as to create networking opportunities and foster re search collaborations.
