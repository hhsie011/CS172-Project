The Reading of Books and the Reading of Literature Home The Art of Compiling Imagining the Author in Print Forming the English Canon Reading the Ideal Copy This online exhibition is meant to accompany a day-long symposium at Columbia University on April 27, 2012. The exhibition, along with the conference, focuses on the relation between literature and the media in which it is conveyed. The symposium examines the extent to which the material forms of texts can contribute to the reading of literature as well as the construction of literary history, and, conversely, what literary analysis can contribute to the study of books as material objects. The symposium, organized by Ivan LupiÄ‡ and Ashley Streeter, has been made possible through the generous support of the Columbia University Seminars on Shakespeare and the Renaissance, the Rare Book and Manuscript Library, the English and Comparative Literature Department, and the Paul Oskar Kristeller fund.
