The meters are labeled with a green sticker that displays instructions for how to pay using ParkMobile and there are green ParkMobile signs at then entrances to the yellow lots specifying the Zone #. The hourly cost of paying to park via ParkMobile is the same as long-term meters is $1.50 per hour. The hourly cost of paying to park via ParkMobile in the garages is the same as the regular cost which is $1.75 for the first hour and $1.50 for each additional hour after. There is an additional $.35 fee collected by ParkMobile for each transaction. ParkMobile allows you to add time to a meter remotely by phone instead of having to return to the lot to manually put in more coins. You also can choose to receive text message alerts when your time is about to expire. There are ParkMobile-enabled meters in lots 1, 210, and 301. The entirety of all yellow lots and all three parking garages are also ParkMobile-enabled zones in which you can pay the hourly price for parking in stalls without a meter. When paying with ParkMobile, enter the zone number posted on the meter sticker (or on the signs for the parking garages and yellow lots) and your license plate information.
