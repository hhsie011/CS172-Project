Within this study plan are the 30 semester units required for the M.S. degree, including 18 units of required core courses and 12 units of electives. Students must complete all requirements of the M.S. with an overal grade-point average of “C” or better. MATH 150A and MATH 270A must be completed with at least a “C” (2.0). All other mathematics and physical science courses required for the degree must be completed with at least a “C-” (1.7) to count as prerequisite courses to engineering courses or as credit towards the degree. All core courses in the major must be passed with a “C-” (1.7) or better. Admission Requirements Entering freshmen must be CSUF eligible Must have a minimum high school GPA (unweighted) of 3.0 Must have successfully completed at least three AP courses (defined as receiving a score of 3, 4 or 5) towards the major and/or general education (total of 10 semester credits) One of the three AP courses must be Mathematics/Calculus AB or Mathematics/Calculus BC (score of 4 or 5 is required). Admission Requirements for International Students International students must meet all the requirements listed above in the Admission Requirements. Verification of English proficiency and financial resources will be governed by the criteria established by the university. All international students must submit their TOEFL score before they can be admitted to the program. The minimum score of 500 on the paper-based TOEFL exam or 61 on the internet-based TOEFL exam is required, as they are admitted to the cohort program as freshmen. Graduate Standing - Classified Achievement of the Classified Graduate Standing status requires the following: Approval of a formal Study Plan by the Computer Engineering Program Coordinator and Office of Graduate Studies Students enrolled in the program must meet with an adviser prior to completing thirteen units toward the M.S. degree to develop a Study Plan.

Students seeking a degree in Engineering have been provided exceptions from some of the General Education requirements. For this reason, it is important that students take the approved G.E. courses for Engineering majors that are found in their Titan Degree Audit (TDA). Additionally, they should confirm the G.E. courses that are required within their specific programs with their respective advisers. Upper-Division Writing Requirement Completing both of the following courses fulfills the upper-division English writing requirement: EGCP 441 - Advanced Electronics for Computer Engineers (4) EGCP 471 - Multidisciplinary Projects in Computer Engineering - II (2) Additional Information Written work for the two courses must meet professional standards. Both courses must be passed with a “C” (2.0) or better to satisfy the writing requirement. Graduate Writing Degree Requirement Competency in written communication in English must be demonstrated by a passing score on the California State University Examination in Writing Proficiency (EWP). The requirement must be satisfied before the student can be classified. Students who fail to pass the EWP test may complete ENGL 301 or ENGL 360 with a “C” (2.0) or better as an alternative to the EWP requirement.
