Each student's grid may differ from the plan detailed below. For example, one of our fastest-growing focus areas is Hospitality Management. This MALS discipline is usually coupled with Sport Commerce because of the functional overlap in areas such as event management, marketing, finance, and operations. Other secondary disciplines like Business or Foreign Languages could also be excellent complements to Hospitality Management. Whatever subjects a student may wish to undertake, the MALS program allows that student to have a personal stake in designing his or her own degree. I. First Semester 1.
