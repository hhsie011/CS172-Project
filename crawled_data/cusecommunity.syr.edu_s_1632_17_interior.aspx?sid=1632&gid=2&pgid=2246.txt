The award is named for George Arents, a successful manufacturer who served on Syracuse University’s Board of Trustees from 1930 until his death in 1960. Among his many legacies to the University is a fund he endowed in 1939 to provide the Arents Award, an annual honor recognizing SU alumni for their extraordinary achievements Since 1939, more than 200 talented, accomplished and distinguished alumni from a vast scope of disciplines have been honored with the Arents Award. These award recipients were selected by a committee of the Syracuse University Alumni Association’s board of directors and approved by the Chancellor.
