You are there for the wellbeing of others. This session is to support your wellbeing and growth. As someone who dedicates their life to meaningful change in the world, it can feel like there’s never enough time to get things done. And that sometimes this focus on social impact may come at the expense of other important matters. So in this session, we look at the fact that being human means we each have finite time. How can this awareness wake us up to act on what's most important; to live a richer, fuller life; to create even greater impact? What would we do if we had a year to live?
