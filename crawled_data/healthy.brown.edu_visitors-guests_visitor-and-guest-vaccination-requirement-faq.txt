COVID-19 Vaccination FAQ for Visitors and Guests Requirements Based on Categories of Visitors What type of visitors and guests are required by Brown to be up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations? Long-term and short-term visitors are required to provide documentation or attest to being up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations; limited-duration visitors are not. Who is a long-term visitor? Long-term visitors (e.g., researchers, visiting faculty) are on campus usually for a semester or more, although sometimes for shorter periods of time, and typically have an appointment in Workday. These visitors are required to upload documentation of being up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations into Workday prior to beginning work at Brown, in a similar manner to faculty and staff. Requests for exemption from the up to date vaccination requirement from long-term visitors will not be considered; if these visitors are not up to date with their vaccinations against COVID-19, they must engage with the University virtually. However, if the visitor is an individual with a disability, the individual may seek a reasonable accommodation by contacting Broadspire. See the Employee Accommodation Services webpage for more information. Who is a short-term visitor? Short-term visitors are those who visit campus four full days or more over the course of a month. They are required to sign an on-line University up to date vaccination attestation form that will be provided to visitors after their host department initiates the attestation form process by entering the visitor’s information via this form (login required). Requests for exemption from the vaccination requirement from short-term visitors will not be considered; if these visitors are not up to date with their vaccinations against COVID-19, they must engage with the University virtually. However, if the visitor is an individual with a disability, the individual may seek a reasonable accommodation by contacting Broadspire. See the Employee Accommodation Services webpage for more information. Short-term visitors must abide by the COVID-19 Campus Safety Policy and any requirements specific to the facility or program they are visiting (e.g., health care or medical research settings with indoor mask requirements). Examples of short-term visitors include: regular external users of core research facilities; skills-based practitioners (e.g., visiting artists working with students and others for limited periods of time); prospective students (and family members) and prospective faculty or staff visiting the campus for tours, interviews or recruiting visits lasting more than three days; participants attending day and residential summer Sports Camps; RISD faculty and staff who wish to access the Brown University Library or Brown Athletic Facilities and Programs regardless of the number of times they access those facilities; consultants on long-term sustained engagements. Who is a limited-duration visitor? Limited-duration visitors are those who visit campus three days per month or less. Limited-duration visitors are generally not required to sign an up to date vaccination attestation form; they must abide by the COVID-19 Campus Safety Policy and any requirements specific to the facility or program they are visiting (e.g., health care or medical research settings with indoor mask requirements). Limited-duration visitors must comply with current University policy regarding face masks and coverings (see the University’s COVID-19 Campus Activity Status page for the current policy for both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals). Examples of limited-duration visitors include: guests attending a lecture, performance, conference, event, campus tour or athletic competition; prospective students (and family members) and prospective faculty and staff visiting the campus for less than three days; all human subject research participants coming to campus for research participation regardless of the duration of their interaction with the Brown community; visitors consulting library, art and material culture collections, or viewing exhibitions, gallery displays and cultural points of interest on campus. What type of a visitor is a human subject participant whose participation involves coming to campus? Human subject participants who are required to come to campus for their participation are always considered limited-duration visitors regardless of whether they fall within the short-term or limited-duration categories. (Research participants engaging with the Brown community solely for research participation should not be long-term visitors.) Therefore, they are not required to prove or attest to up to date vaccination status. Participation in such programs is typically for limited periods of time in highly structured and supervised environments. These participants must abide by the COVID-19 Campus Safety Policy and any requirements specific to the facility or program they are visiting (e.g., health care or medical research settings with indoor mask requirements), in addition to current University policy regarding face masks and coverings (see the University’s COVID-19 Campus Activity Status page for the current policy for both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals). Researchers who have questions about requirements relevant to participants should email visitors@brown.edu. What if I don’t know how to categorize my visitor’s duration? Please read the descriptions in the questions above. If you still have questions regarding whether a visitor is long-term, short-term or limited-duration, those questions can be directed to visitors@brown.edu. For long-term and short-term visitors, what vaccinations are accepted by Brown? The University accepts FDA and WHO recognized COVID-19 vaccines and boosters. Three COVID-19 vaccinations have been granted Emergency Use Authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA): Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson. Any of the three are acceptable for long-term and short-term visitors to satisfy the up to date with COVID-19 vaccination requirement. In addition, for those who may be receiving vaccinations outside of the U.S., the University will accept COVID-19 vaccines for which the World Health Organization has issued an Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL). What does being up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations mean? An individual is up to date with the vaccinations against COVID-19 when they have received all recommended COVID-19 vaccines, including any booster dose(s) when eligible. For example, an individual is up to date when they have received a full course of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or World Health Organization (WHO) authorized COVID-19 vaccine, and any booster dose(s) when eligible. Are campus tour participants required to show proof of vaccination? No, campus tour participants are limited-duration visitors and are not required to submit proof of or attest to vaccination status. They must comply with all guidance and direction from tour guides, including mask wearing protocols and policies in effect at the time of the tour (see the University’s COVID-19 Campus Activity Status page for the current policy for both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals). Are guest lecturers, performers or athletes and/or audience members and spectators at a lecture, performance, athletic competition or similar event required to show proof of or attest to vaccination? No, guest lecturers, performers and audience members visiting for a single lecture, performance, event or similar activity are limited-duration visitors and are not required to show proof of or attest to vaccination status. They must comply with all guidance and direction from event hosts, including mask wearing protocols and policies in effect at the time of the event. Are vendors and contractors working at Brown required to be up to date with their COVID-19 vaccinations? The University's COVID-19 policies and protocols for vendors and contractors are available on the Strategic Purchasing, Contracts and Insurance website: Conducting Business with Brown University page. Similar to long-term and short-term visitors, vendors whose level of engagement with the Brown campus require being up to date with their COVID-19 vaccinations (e.g., sustained and consistent in-person contact) must attest that their employees are up to date. Vendors and contractors in this category will be notified by the University about the process. Questions regarding these requirements should be directed to Purchasing@Brown.edu. Are RISD students, faculty and staff allowed on the Brown campus? RISD students are required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and may access as normally allowed facilities and programs on both campuses with their Brown or RISD identification card and without further documentation or proof of vaccination. RISD faculty and staff are strongly encouraged but not required to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Brown and RISD have entered into an agreement for the Fall 2021 semester to govern RISD faculty and staff access to Brown facilities and programs following the policy in place for Brown visitors and guests. RISD faculty and staff who qualify as short term visitors (four or more days a month) must complete a vaccination attestation form initiated by the Brown department serving as their host. RISD faculty and staff who are limited-duration visitors do not have to complete the form. RISD faculty and staff who wish to access the Brown University Library or Brown Athletic Facilities and Programs are considered short-term visitors regardless of the number of times they access those facilities and are required to complete a vaccination attestation form (and be 14 days past their final dose) prior to the first visit and before an access card will be issued. Responsibilities of Host Departments What are the responsibilities of host departments for visitors and guests? Host departments are responsible for their visitors and guests, including ensuring that they are aware of and comply with the University’s COVID-19 Campus Safety Policy and all relevant health and safety protocols. When hosting a short-term visitor who is working on-site at Brown four or more days per month, departments must enter contact information for each visitor (name, email address, date of arrival and length of visit) in the department visitor form (login required). The visitor will then receive via email a link to an up to date vaccination attestation form that they must read and complete, affirming that they are up to date with their COVID-19 vaccinations. The department and the visitor will receive email confirmation after the form is successfully completed. Can departments require visitors and guests for conferences and events lasting less than four days to complete an up to date vaccination attestation form? In some circumstances, but only with written approval in advance from the Provost’s Office. For example, a department may require up to date vaccination attestation forms for visitors attending a one- to three-day conference or seminar where participants are in shared spaces in close proximity for all or most of the program. Departments hosting such events and who wish to consider requiring visitors and guests to complete the up to date vaccination attestation form should contact visitors@brown.edu well in advance, and no less than two weeks before of the event. Can departments require visiting lecturers or guest instructors who are on campus for less than four days to complete an up to date vaccination attestation form? In some circumstances, but only with approval in advance from the Provost’s Office. For example, a guest artist arrives on a Tuesday. They have dinner on Tuesday night with students, participate in class visits and a rehearsal on Wednesday, and give a public performance or lecture on Thursday. While the visiting lecturer or guest is on campus less than four days, the level of sustained and consistent in-person contact of the engagement warrants treating the guest artist as a short-term visitor who must complete the up to date vaccination attestation form in advance of their visit. Departments hosting such visitors and who wish to consider requiring them to complete the up to date vaccination attestation form should contact visitors@brown.edu well in advance, and no less than two weeks before the visit. What should departments hosting events say about COVID-19 policies in event publicity materials or at the event itself? Event publicity materials can link to the Visitors and Guests page on this Healthy Brown website and include the following: “Brown University abides by public health guidance and health and safety protocols to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19. Event attendees, including visitors and guests, must comply with all University policies and protocols in place at the time of the event, including current University policy regarding face masks and coverings (see the University’s COVID-19 Campus Activity Status page for the current policy for both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals).” A similar statement can be made at the beginning of an event. Contact I have a question about visitors and guests that is not answered here. Who do I ask? Departments and members of the Brown community with additional questions regarding visitors and guests related to COVID-19 should send an email to visitors@brown.edu. Last updated Feb. 15, 2022. Information on this page may be updated as the University’s planning evolves and/or public health guidance prompts a shift in Brown’s operations and protocols.
