Dear Colleague: Data from Columbia’s Student Financial Services (SFS) shows that you are enrolled in graduate-level studies–either non-degree course(s) or a degree program for the Spring 2022 term. However, we do not yet have a supervisor-certified Job-Related Graduate Education Certification (JRGEC) form on file for you. In order to take advantage of the job-related tax benefits, we must have an approved certification on file. Due to Covid-19 protocols, your JRGEC forms must be submitted by your supervisor via email to Student Financial Services at [email protected] to confirm the completed form has been signed and certified as job-related per IRS criteria reflected in the University policy. According to IRS guidelines, tuition exemption benefits for graduate-level studies (course numbers 4000 & above) are exempt from taxation up to the federal limit of $5,250 in a calendar year. The value of tuition exemption benefits above the federal limit of $5,250 is treated as taxable imputed income, and taxes will be withheld from your paycheck. The University will spread the tax liability of Tuition Exemption benefits for Spring 2022 classes over the February through May pay periods. The one exception to this IRS guideline is for graduate-level studies certified as “job-related,” per IRS-defined criteria. For guidelines on whether you qualify for the Job-Related tax exemption and instructions on how to complete the form and certify, go to our Job-related Graduate Education Certification page. What You Need to Know About Job-Related Graduate Education Certification Forms Forms must be submitted by Friday, February 4th, 2022 ensure the tax exemption is applied to your student account for: Non-Degree Programs – Forms must be certified and submitted each term to SFS.
