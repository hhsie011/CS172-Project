Appeals & Exceptions Undergraduate, Agricultural Institute, and Non-Degree Students If you have been classified as an out-of-state student for tuition purposes and would like to seek reclassification as an in-state student, you will be required to complete the North Carolina Residency Determination Service (RDS) residency determination process.
