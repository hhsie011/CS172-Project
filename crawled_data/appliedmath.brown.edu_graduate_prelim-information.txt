The Prelim must be completed before the start of Year 3. The Prelim covers a major area with two topics and a minor area, comprising another two topics. Each topic covers the equivalent of at least two semester long courses. Further requirements for the major and minor topics are discussed below. The major area is usually related to the students’ intended research area; the minor topics are meant to demonstrate breadth of subject matter. For more information about the Prelim Examination, please see pages 9 and 10 of the Graduate Handbook.
