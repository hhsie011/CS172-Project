Certificate Overview The Certificate Program in Neuroscience at Princeton is designed for Princeton University undergraduate students with a strong interest in the brain but whose primary studies are in a different subject area. Students pursuing concentrations in a wide variety of fields (e.g., molecular biology, psychology, engineering, chemistry, applied math, economics, politics, history, and music) have successfully completed the neuroscience certificate. There is not an independent work requirement for the Neuroscience Certificate. NOTE: All students seeking this certificate must be currently enrolled at Princeton University as part of a degree-granting department. Requirements To complete the certificate, you must complete six (6) courses. These consist of two core courses: NEU 200 - Functional Neuroanatomy OR NEU 201 Fundamentals of Neuroscience AND NEU 202 Introduction to Cognitive Neuroscience Additionally, you must complete four (4) electives. (Note that if you take NEU 200 and decide to concentrate in Neuroscience, then you must still take NEU 201 and you will not earn credit for it). If you are not using NEU 200 as a core course (that is, you took NEU 201 instead), then NEU 200 can count as an elective. These electives must come from 3 out of 4 subject areas. No course doubling. You can only use NEU courses and electives one time (in one category). These areas are: Molecular/Cellular/Disease Circuits & Systems Neural Computation Social & Cognitive Neuroscience See the NEU Electives page for more details. For any questions related to the Neuroscience Certificate Program, please contact the PNI Undergraduate Administrator, Paryn Wallace (neurocrt[at]princeton[dot]edu).
