Virginia Major: English Tell us about your path to GS! I spent the summer before my senior year of high school studying aquaculture in Cork, Ireland, the experience of which endeared me to Irish university education. The Dual BA then afforded me the ability to continue studying in Ireland without sacrificing the U.S. college experience. What has been your proudest Columbia moment? Placing my first book review in a recognized literary magazine! Who are some people who have contributed the most to your Columbia experience? I really admire Dr. Victoria Rosner as GS’ Dean of Academic Affairs, but also as a teacher and a scholar. She's been incredibly supportive of my studies, and I have her advice to thank for not a few of my decisions, academic or otherwise. I also believe I owe my degree almost entirely to Dean Sara Ede, without whose dedication I'm not sure that the Trinity Dual BA would still exist. What advice would you give to a Columbia student starting their GS journey? Befriend your teachers!
