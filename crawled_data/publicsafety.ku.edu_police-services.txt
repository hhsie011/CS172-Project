The patrol officers enforce federal laws, state statutes and university regulations. The unit is responsible for the prevention of crime, the investigation of crimes that occur on campus, the apprehension of offenders and the recovery of stolen property. The patrol unit has the largest allocation of manpower within the KU Public Safety Office, with 25 commissioned law enforcement officers. The patrol unit consists of a patrol Deputy Chief, six patrol sergeants, and 18 patrol officers. This is the most visible unit of PSO as they are in squad cars and on foot patrol on campus. Responsibilities include documenting and investigating crimes, but also responding to all emergencies that occur on campus, including crimes, medical emergencies, and fires. The patrol unit also investigates vehicular and non-vehicular accidents, and enforces traffic ordinances. Some other responsibilities not traditionally associated with law enforcement include motorist assists, office lockouts, safety escorts and a variety of other citizen requests for assistance. Police Officers in the KU Office of Public Safety are fully commissioned police officers certified by the State of Kansas as established under Kansas Statutes Annotated, 76-726. Police Officers are on duty 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The patrol unit officers work 10-hour shifts with three overlapping squads. Ten-hour shifts have been in place for years and have proved beneficial to our community. The shift configuration allows for additional manpower during periods of increased activity, allowing for better police coverage and service.
