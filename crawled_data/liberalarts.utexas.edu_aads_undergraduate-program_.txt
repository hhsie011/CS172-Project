skip to content Menu x Undergraduate Program The African and African Diaspora Studies (AADS) Department, in concert with the John L. Warfield Center for African and African American Studies, and the Institute for Urban Policy, Research, and Analysis, is dedicated to the study of the intellectual, political, artistic, and social experiences of people of African descent throughout Africa and the African Diaspora, including the United States. AADS majors join world-class UT faculty, staff and students in conversations about race, gender, sexuality, class, and the concept of global Blackness. Students will study diverse topics such as anthropology; diaspora theory (particularly in Central and South America); education; Black feminism and women’s studies; health; identity; law, policy and government; art, literature, music and performance theory; queer theory; social justice and engaged scholarship; and sports. In the required AFR 375: Community Internship course, AADS majors will have the opportunity to give back to the Black community by directly supporting Austin-area organizations associated with social justice for Black people. The premier Black Studies department in the state of Texas, AADS students who are interested in pre-med, pre-law and pre-grad school options will find that an AADS major will complement their future career and academic plans.
