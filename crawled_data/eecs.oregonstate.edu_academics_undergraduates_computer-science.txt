Computer scientists play a role in every professional field, and the need for new computer software developers, computer scientists, and computer systems analysts is projected to grow 11 percent from 2019 to 2029, much faster than the average for all occupations. These occupations are projected to add about 531,200 new jobs. A computer science degree at Oregon State can give you the skills to analyze medical data, create robots, craft artificial intelligences, mine web traffic, combat cybercrime, and much more. Your choices for earning a B.S. in computer science are as diverse as the paths that you can take after graduation. Oregon State University offers the Applied option, through which you can choose different packages of courses to satisfy your Applied graduation requirements. For example, you can choose the cybersecurity package of courses, which you can complete wholly online, on campus, or a mixture of both. Oregon State University delivers this B.S. in computer science 100% online through OSU Ecampus. Or you can satisfy the Applied option requirements by choosing from one of eight other packages (whose courses are all available on-campus and in many cases also available online). If none of these packages exactly match your interests, you can build your own custom package of courses. In addition to the Applied option, you can choose the Systems option, which is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET (in both bachelor of science degrees and in honors bachelor of science degrees). OSU-Cascades offers applied tracks in software engineering and software entrepreneurship. You can learn to build scalable, maintainable software systems or launch your own software startup, and gain hands-on experiences with startups in Bend. Applied Option Degree requirements Cybersecurity Data Science Artificial Intelligence Robot Intelligence Bioinformatics Business and Entrepreneurship Human-Computer Interaction Simulation and Game Programming Web and Mobile Application Development Build Your Own Systems Option Degree requirements Computer Systems Online Programs Online postbaccalaureate computer science degree (B.S.): This program is designed for students who want to earn their computer science degree online and who already have a bachelor’s degree in a different academic discipline. Online computer science degree: This program is for students who do not already have a bachelor's degree and want to earn a computer science wholly online, on campus, or a mixture of both. Undergraduate certificate in cybersecurity: This certificate is for any student currently pursuing a bachelor's degree at Oregon State (including students in the postbaccalaureate computer science program), or anyone who already has a bachelor’s degree from an accredited institution. Computer science minor: This minor provides a wealth of knowledge and skills that are in high demand in virtually every industry, from business and education to agricultural sciences and health care.
