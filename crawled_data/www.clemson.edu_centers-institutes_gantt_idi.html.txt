To help Clemson University achieve its strategic goals, an instrument called the Intercultural Development Inventory can be used to assess intercultural competence, create self and/or group awareness, and provide an individualized plan for growth and advancement. Intercultural Development Inventory The Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI) is a psychometric instrument that assesses intercultural competence – the capability to shift cultural perspective and appropriately adapt behavior to cultural differences and commonalities. This 50-item questionnaire is available in 17 languages, it can be accessed online, and takes approximately 15-20 minutes to complete. After taking the assessment, IDI generates an Individual Profile Report that outlines the individual’s capacity to shift perspectives and appropriately adapt behaviors and an Individual Development Plan (IDP) – a detailed blueprint for the individual to further develop their cultural competence. The IDI also generates group intercultural competence profiles. Group profiles are used to assess a department or organization’s intercultural competence as an aggregate. The group profile results allow the department or organization to identify cross-cultural goals and challenges and develop adaptive strategies that can be used while working with individuals from diverse backgrounds. What are the steps in taking the IDI? To request the IDI for a group, complete this form. To request the IDI for an individual, complete this form.
