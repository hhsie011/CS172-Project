We work across disciplines to tackle the challenges of our time through world-renowned research, education and outreach. The questions we probe and the answers we seek focus on three overlapping concerns: natural and human systems; food, energy and environmental resources; and social, physical and economic well-being. Since our founding, we have evolved continuously to meet the changing needs of our world. Our top-ranked programs include over 20 majors in community and rural development, environment and natural resources, food and nutrition, communication, applied economics, agriculture, international programs and life sciences. The excellence of our science is matched by the generosity of our spirit. We aim to leave the world better than we found it, so we seek out those not simply driven to master their discipline, but who are also passionate about doing so to serve the public good. CALS is fundamentally invested in improving the lives of people, their environments and their communities both in New York State and around the world. The Cornell CALS experience empowers us to explore the boundaries of knowledge, supported by the leading minds of today and surrounded by the leading minds of tomorrow.
