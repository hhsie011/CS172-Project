If there is a threat and you can escape: 1) Move away from the threat as quickly as possible. 2) Run if you're able. If the threat is near you and you can't escape: 1) Find a secure room and lock the door. 2) Put any big object in front of the door to prevent entry. 3) Turn off lights and silence all electronic devices. 4) Hide behind furniture and be as quiet as possible. 5) Wait for CSUF PD to release you from your position. If you can't (safely) lock the door or escape: 1) Hide and be prepared to disarm the threat. 2) Two to five person (attack team) should be just inside the door to knock down the weapon and push the shooter to the floor and disarm. 3) Do everything you can to survive until CSUF PD arrives. When police enter the room show your hands and follow instructions.
