The initiative’s predominant purpose is to promote awareness, education, and provide informed perspectives across topics that will help cultivate and strengthen OSU’s commitment to diversity and inclusion. More importantly, this monthly series of dialogues will help build the capacity of all members of the university community to gain comfort in participating in efforts that ultimately enrich and fortify OSU’s culture of inclusion.
