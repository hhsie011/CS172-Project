Our Augustinian Catholic mission calls us to care for all people and honor our enduring commitments to the common good. Our pursuit of truth leaves absolutely no room for harboring stereotypes or prejudice. We denounce any such attitudes and behaviors, and urge all Villanovans to treat others with respect, care and empathy. Community First The Caritas Commitment Community First: The CARITAS Commitment is our pledge, as Villanovans, to modify our behaviors to ensure the health and safety of the community.
