Staff partner with experts across campus to answer questions and offer creative solutions for engaging internationally. Collaborations and Agreements Global Operations provides guidance and resources for faculty and college leadership managing international collaborations and agreements. OVPIA maintains a database of international collaborative agreements across all units. Expanding Cornell’s Global Footprint Global Hubs Cornell is building a new platform for sustained interdisciplinary collaborations in locations worldwide. Global Hubs bring together faculty, students, alumni, public and private sector entities, and local communities for broad-reaching partnerships that combine research, learning, and engagement. No two Hubs will be identical, but they will all share Cornell’s academic distinction, educational verve, and civic responsibility. OVPIA is leading the Global Hubs initiative in consultation with university leadership and faculty, students, and staff across Cornell.
