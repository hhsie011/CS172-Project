The basic purposes of the International Association of Counseling Services (IACS) are to encourage and aid counseling services throughout the United States and internationally to meet high professional standards, to inform the public about those which are competent and reliable, and to foster communication among counseling services operating in a variety of settings. IACS is committed to furthering the visibility of the counseling profession and improving its quality. IACS has evolved standards that define professional quality and has established criteria for accreditation which reflect these standards. IACS accreditation also acts as a stimulus to a wide variety of agencies to upgrade their professional services to meet accreditation standards, and the Association provides the profession and the public with information about those agencies which it has accredited. Accreditation is open to University and College Counseling Centers and Public and Private Counseling Agencies. The information above was taken from the International Accreditation of Counseling Services (IACS) website. American Psychological Association (APA) Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) offers a pre-doctoral internship in professional psychology that has been continuously accredited by the American Psychological Association (APA) since 1988. The term “accredited” provides public notification that the CAPS internship program meets standards of quality set forth by the APA Commission on Accreditation. Recognition by the accrediting agency also reflects the internship’s commitment to continuous self-study and external review, with the aim of enhancing the quality of education and training provided.
