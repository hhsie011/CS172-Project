Enrolling in this major is especially appropriate if you wish to pursue advanced study to prepare for leadership positions in governmental or nongovernmental organizations, working directly with current and emerging health concerns in the U.S. or internationally. Learn more about the GPHS major What is Global and Public Health Sciences? Public health is the prevention of illness and promotion of wellness in communities both large and small. The Global and Public Health Sciences (GPHS) major teaches the tools of public health research and action and their application to population health issues in the U.S. and globally. The work of public health professionals is distinct from the work of clinical professionals, who typically treat individuals after they have become sick or injured. Public health actions often involve educational and/or governmental approaches that influence many people simultaneously, for example, to address issues such as obesity and diabetes, food security, HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases, quality of food, water and air, and access to health care. Sustained improvement of the health of populations often requires a multidisciplinary approach involving the biomedical, behavioral, social, political and environmental sciences, and careful consideration of the importance of cultural and ethical contexts. The GPHS major is intended for students who are interested in: Health problems of communities as small as a village and as large as a country, and the actions that will protect or improve the lives of large numbers of individuals within communities Advanced study leading leadership positions in governmental or non-governmental organizations that deal directly with current and emerging health concerns in the U.S. or internationally What courses and experiences are part of the GPHS major? Public health actions often address such issues as obesity and diabetes, food security, HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases; quality of food, water and air; and health care access. GPHS majors develop a strong background in biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, and physiology. These courses provide a foundation with which to understand the biomedical basis of public health issues. GPHS students also complete several core courses, a supervised Experiential Learning Opportunity, and a range of upper-level selectives, described in more detail below. Core Courses NS 1600 Introduction to Public Health NS 2600 Introduction to Global Health NS 2060 Preparation for Engaged Learning in GPHS (NOTE: For GPHS majors, please note that NS 2060 must be completed prior to pursuing an ELO to fulfill the major requirement.) NS 3600 Epidemiology NS 4600 Explorations in Global and Public Health NS 1600 and NS 2600 introduce students to the principles of public health practice and research in the U.S. and internationally. Using case studies, students learn about achievements, challenges, and controversies in the field of public health and a range of career opportunities. NS 2060 helps to prepare GPHS majors for their Experiential Learning Opportunity (described below). NS 3600 introduces students to epidemiology, often referred to as the cornerstone of public health. Epidemiology and biostatistics (preferably STSCI 2150 Introductory Statistics for Biology) should be completed within the first five semesters. Upon completion of the Experiential Learning Opportunity, seniors enroll in NS 4600 Explorations in Global and Public Health, the capstone course in the major. This course includes a reflective document and presentation connecting the experiential component with the core principles of public health as presented in core coursework. Given the interdisciplinary nature of population health problems, students are required to take one advanced course in each of the following three areas: Social and Behavioral Health, Biological Aspects of Public Health, Environmental Health, and Health Policy & Practice. Students choose from a list of courses in each area according to their interests and course schedule. Topics include public health microbiology, public health nutrition, nutrition and disease, nutrition and global health, social inequalities in physical and mental health, the U.S. healthcare system, reproductive health, and risk analysis and management. Where might a degree in Global and Public Health Sciences lead me? Opportunities in public health are numerous and growing. The GPHS major provides an excellent foundation for a wide variety of careers in public health, public service, research, social entrepreneurship, medicine and other health careers both domestically and globally: Public health fields such as epidemiology, biostatistics, health education and behavior, international health, health policy and management, environmental health, and many more Medicine and other health careers such as physical therapist, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical pharmacy Research including careers that use biochemical, physiological, genomic, clinical, and social science methods to improve human health and well-being domestically and globally In many cases, these career paths will require appropriate graduate or professional training, such as a Master’s in Public Health. Students are encouraged to meet with advisors and career counselors to ensure appropriate undergraduate preparation, as specific requirements differ among the various fields. Can I transfer into or add the Global and Public Health Sciences major? Transferring into the GPHS major Freshmen and sophomores (not juniors or seniors) are eligible to submit an application to transfer into the GPHS major after completing either NS 1600 or NS 2600 with a grade of B (NOT B-) or higher, one required chemistry course with a grade of C (NOT C-) or higher, and one required biology course with a grade of C (NOT C-) or higher. All students must complete this application, which includes a draft undergraduate plan demonstrating the ability to complete the GPHS major on time and with the required sequence, regardless of starting major/College. Students applying from other Colleges must first successfully complete the GPHS application process before completing the internal transfer process. Interested students should contact dnsglobalhealth@cornell.edu for advising questions, and submit the required application. Students who are interested in an Internal Transfer to the GPHS major from a different College at Cornell must also contact the Admissions office of their target College (Human Ecology or CALS). Adding GPHS as a second major The GPHS major may not be combined with a second major, whether a student is completing the GPHS major through Human Ecology or CALS. An alternative to consider is the Global Health minor, which may be combined with any non-GPHS major in any college. Requirements for GPHS majors Requirements for GPHS majors in CHE See also the College of Human Ecology Curriculum Sheets. All of the following sections are required to be completed to graduate. Courses in areas 1-16 must be taken for a Letter Grade. DNS students may not use courses to fulfill more than one requirement among areas 1-16.

Additional Requirements (10-12 credits) Any course with the Course Distribution PBS, SBA, KCM, MQR, LA, CA, or HA. Language courses may count here. For example, students interested in pre-health tracks (e.g. medicine or physical therapy) could fulfill this requirement by taking required pre-health courses such as CHEM 2080 General Chemistry II, an organic chemistry lab, and two-course sequences in both organic chemistry and physics. Electives (Variable) Any courses that are not taken in Areas 1-16 above count as Electives. We recommend students consider taking either NS 1150 (F) or NS 1220 (S) as an elective to prepare for the upper level nutrition courses, some of which require or recommend these courses as pre-requisites (eg., NS 2470, NS 3030, NS 3060, NS 3150, NS 3310, NS 4250, NS 4410, NS 4420, NS 4500). Physical Education Requirement (2 courses) Physical Education must be completed in order to graduate. However, physical education does not count toward college and university minimum credit requirements for full-time status, nor does it count towards the 120 credits required for graduation. Swim Test Requirement A successful swim test must be completed in order to graduate. College Polices: 120 Overall Credits Students must complete 120 credits toward graduation. A maximum of 15 credits of AP credit and in absentia credit can count towards the 120 total credits. 15 credits of Study Abroad/Exchange, Cornell-In-Washington, or Capital semester can count towards total electives. A course can only count towards the 120 total credits required once. Students who exceed the above parameters—i.e., by taking more than 15 credits in cases (a), (b), and (c), or taking a course more than once—will have their total required credits increase by the same amount, and all credits will be counted toward their GPA. For example, a student who takes a 3-credit course twice to improve their grade will then be required to complete 123 total credits, and will have both grades factored into their GPA. 43 HE Credits Students must complete a minimum of 43 HE credits. HE non-departmental courses at the 2000-level and below do not count toward the 43 HE credits. Students must complete 5 HE credits by the end of the freshmen year and 12 HE credits by the end of the sophomore year. 9 HE Credits outside the major Students must complete a minimum of 9 HE credits outside of NS. These credits are given for any Human Ecology course outside your major (except 4030). These can be taken S/U only if course is NOT used to fulfill a curriculum requirement. Pass/Fail Courses [S/U] S/U grading option may NOT be used for any required course [Areas 1-16] unless it is the only grade option offered for those courses. S/Us MAY be used for the 9 HE Credits outside the major and for electives in Area 17. Students may apply no more than 12 credits of S/U towards graduation requirements. If a required course is only offered S/U, it will not count towards this limit. Students may take more S/Us if they choose, but the additional credit will not be applied towards graduation. The deadline for changing grade options is the 57th calendar day of the semester, the same as the “drop” deadline. Special Study Courses [4000, 4010, 4020, 4030] A maximum of 12 credits of special study course work from Human Ecology or other colleges will count towards the 120 overall credits (e.g. DNS special studies course work includes NS 4000, 4010, 4020, and 4030). Courses will be indicated on the class roster with a Component of either IND or RSC. [Additional credits can be taken but will not be applied.] A maximum of 12 credits of 4000-4030 may count toward the 43 HE credit requirement. A maximum of 3 credits of 4000-4020 (not including 4030) may count towards the 9 credits outside the major requirement as long as the special study is in a department outside the student’s major. Students cannot TA (4030) the same course for credit more than once or take and TA the same course simultaneously. 4030 does not fulfill any requirements towards the major. Registration for 4030 may not exceed 5 credit hours per semester. Students who wish to take NS Special Studies Courses must have taken and passed at least 2 S/U credits of the same course. Requirements for GPHS majors in CALS See also the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Degree Requirements. All of the following sections must be completed to graduate. Courses in areas 1-15 must be taken for a Letter Grade. DNS students may not use courses to fulfill more than one requirement among areas 1-15, even though DUST indicates otherwise for CALS students. Credit requirements for the GPHS major Total CALS CALS, outside the major: 120 credits 55 credits (NS credits plus any from other CALS departments) 9 credits from non-NS CALS departments Introductory Chemistry (4-8 credits): (a) CHEM 2070 General Chemistry I 1, 2 (4 cr) AND CHEM 2080 General Chemistry II (Spring, 4 cr) (two-course sequence required for pre-health) (b) CHEM 2070 General Chemistry I 1, 2 (4 cr) (single course not adequate for pre-health) (c) CHEM 1560 Introduction to General Chemistry 1 (4 cr) (not for pre-health) (d) CHEM 2150 Honors General and Inorganic Chemistry 2, 3 (4 cr) (not for pre-health) 1 Students may use an AP Chemistry score of 5 to place out of CHEM 2070.

Select courses from First-year Writing Seminars and COMM or ENGL classes as per CALS distribution requirements. Note: Potential courses to fulfill this and any CALS distribution requirement may be found in “DUST.” Social Sciences and Humanities (12 credits)1 Complete 12 credits, including four courses of at least 3 cr each: • The four chosen courses must include at least 3 different categories from the following list: Cultural Analysis (CA), Human Diversity (D), Foreign Language (FL), Historical Analysis (HA), Knowledge, Cognition, and Moral Reasoning (KCM), Literature and the Arts (LA), and Social and Behavioral Analysis (SBA). • At least one course must be in Human Diversity (D) 1GPHS majors may not use a major-required course (e.g. a major core course, selective, or advanced major elective) to fulfill this requirement. Statistics (4 credits) STSCI 2150 Introductory Statistics for Biology (4 cr)1 1 Must be taken at Cornell; AP Statistics is not accepted. Additional Requirements (10-12 credits) Any course with the Course Distribution PBS, SBA, KCM, MQR, LA, CA, or HA. Language courses may count here. For example, students interested in pre-health tracks (e.g. medicine or physical therapy) could fulfill this requirement by taking required pre-health courses such as CHEM 2080 General Chemistry II, an organic chemistry lab, and two-course sequences in both organic chemistry and physics. Electives (Variable) Any courses that are not taken in Areas 1-15 above count as Electives. We recommend students consider taking either NS 1150 (F) or NS 1220 (S) as an elective to prepare for the upper level nutrition courses, some of which require or recommend these courses as pre-requisites (eg., NS 2470, NS 3030, NS 3060, NS 3150, NS 3310, NS 4250, NS 4410, NS 4420, NS 4500). Physical Education Requirement (2 courses) Physical Education must be completed in order to graduate. However, physical education does not count toward college and university minimum credit requirements for full-time status, nor does it count towards the 120 credits required for graduation. Swim Test Requirement A successful swim test must be completed in order to graduate. College Polices: 120 Overall Credits Students must complete 120 credits toward graduation. A maximum of 15 credits of AP credit and in absentia credit can count towards the 120 total credits. 15 credits of Study Abroad/Exchange, Cornell-In-Washington, or Capital semester can count towards total electives. A course can only count towards the 120 total credits required once. Students who exceed the above parameters—i.e., by taking more than 15 credits in cases (a), (b), and (c), or taking a course more than once—will have their total required credits increase by the same amount, and all credits will be counted toward their GPA. For example, a student who takes a 3-credit course twice to improve their grade will then be required to complete 123 total credits, and will have both grades factored into their GPA. CALS Credits CALS students must complete a minimum of 55 HE credits. DNS students must complete a minimum of 9 of these 55 credits from non-NS CALS coursework. Pass/Fail Courses [S/U] S/U grading option may NOT be used for any required course [Areas 1-15] unless it is the only grade option offered for those courses. S/Us MAY be used for the 9 CALS Credits outside the major and for electives in Area 16. The deadline for changing grade options is the 57th calendar day of the semester, the same as the “drop” deadline. Special Study Courses [4000, 4010, 4020, 4030] A maximum of 12 credits of special study course work from CALS or other colleges will count towards the 120 overall credits (e.g. DNS special studies course work includes NS 4000, 4010, 4020, and 4030). Courses will be indicated on the class roster with a Component of either IND or RSC. [Additional credits can be taken but will not be applied.] Students who wish to take NS Special Studies Courses must have taken and passed at least 2 S/U credits of the same course. Students may petition to waive this requirement if their previous experience is equivalent to this “training period’; for more information, contact dnsstudentservices@cornell.edu.
