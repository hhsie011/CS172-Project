A. If you have earned AP/IB credit for English Composition, then this requirement is complete and you do not need to select a course in this area. B. If you earned an SAT Verbal score greater than 700 or an ACT score greater than 32, then English 105 is waived. You may proceed to enroll in English 106. Math Requirement All School of Communication students must complete a minimum of 3-6 credits in math above MTH 101 (MTH 107 does not satisfy this requirement) Freshmen or transfers who have not completed a mathematics course are required to take the ALEKS placement exam: http://www.math.miami.edu/undergraduate/aleks-math-placement/. Your Canelink account will have your Math placement level indicated for you based on the following criteria: Your Math level will be pre-determined for you based on your Math SAT or Math ACT entrance exam scores. If you are unhappy with your placement, there is a link to an online Math placement exam on your Canelink account if you decide that you would like to try and take a higher level math course. If you have earned AP/IB credit for Math, then your Math requirement will be satisfied for all majors in the School of Communication. The School of Communication offers minors in each of its nine Programs of Study and a general minor in Communication (COM). Cognates The University of Miami’s General Education Requirements ensure that graduates have acquired essential intellectual skills and have engaged a range of academic disciplines. All new students will fulfill the General Education requirements by selecting a Cognate, which is a cluster of courses arranged by their content, field and interest. A cognate is a group of at least three related courses for at least 9 credits. The courses in a cognate are related in a topical, thematic, interdisciplinary, sequential, or other such fashion, so that completion of a cognate provides coherent depth of knowledge in the area. Students must take three cognates to fulfill the Areas of Knowledge requirement, one in the Arts & Humanities (A&H), one in People & Society (P&S), and one in Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics (STEM). One covered by major/minor, see advisor. Your major satisfies one of your cognate requirements.
