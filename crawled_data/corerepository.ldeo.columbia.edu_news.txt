The four ILCs were donated by John Wehmiller and are available for use by the community. For more information see the article, "Long-term preservation of amino acid racemization interlaboratory comparison samples". R/V Pelican (cruise PE22-17) at the LDCR The R/V Pelican Sets Sail, and Data Collection Begins Jan. 19, 2022 - A cruise aboard the R/V Pelican, headed by Cecilia McHugh and Leonardo Seeber, will bring new cores to the LDCR in early February. The purpose of the cruise is to, "...evaluate the potential earthquake hazard along the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault, located between Haiti and Jamaica." From Cecilia, "All is well here. We started coring on January 9 and have collected so far 11 jumbo gravity cores and 5 multicores... If all goes well we'll collect another 10." Looking forward to some fresh mud! Feb. 11, 2022 - Splitting of the PE22-17 cores began yesterday with the multicores that were taken on the cruise. The sediment types, calcareous ooze and iron-rich mineral based sediments, are incredibly different depending on where they were taken along the fault!

Use the previous and next buttons to change the displayed slide Slide 1: PE22-17-MC01, this core is a calcareous ooze composed mainly of microfossils! Slide 2: Ready to scan, this multicore has layers from multiple earthquake events. Slide 3: This multicore is very short due to the large piece of wood debris and sand bed that stopped the barrels from penetrating further. Slide 4: Small amounts of material from the cores smeared onto slides (smear slides) that will be used to identify what is in all the mud!
