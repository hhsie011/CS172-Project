In this first virtual edition, participants will explore the theme — Africa on the Move: Charting a Path Forward in the Wake of a Global Crisis with the presence of distinguished speakers. The goal this year is to evaluate the progress being made on the continent amid the COVID-19 pandemic, in areas including trade, healthcare, technology and innovation, social movements, and capital investment. While showcasing this growth and development over the past year, solutions to the pressing issues that will likely challenge Africa's post-pandemic economic recovery will be discussed. Through candid and holistic conversations, this year’s conference will provide a lively virtual space to discuss the ways in which creative and innovative ideas can be leveraged to positively shape Africa's future and cement it's place as a major player in the global economy. https://www.columbia-aef.com/ Upcoming Events Columbia Global CentersAmman / Beijing / Istanbul / Mumbai / Nairobi / Paris / Rio / Santiago / Tunis Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
