Etienne Balibar’s friends and colleagues at Columbia University, Souleymane Bachir Diagne, Emmanuelle Saada, and Bernard Harcourt, engage in a dialogue with him and reflect together on the importance and influence of his oeuvre, not only in philosophical thought, but in disciplines ranging from history to sociology to political science, and in public discourse. This first discussion will focus on Balibar’s writings, and will be followed by a second conversation on September 24. Etienne Balibar teaches at Columbia every Fall semester.

His works include Lire le Capital (with Louis Althusser, Pierre Macherey, Jacques Rancière, Roger Establet); The Philosophy of Marx; Spinoza and politics; We, the People of Europe?; Secularism and Cosmopolitanism.
