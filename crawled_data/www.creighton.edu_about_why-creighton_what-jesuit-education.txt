What is a Jesuit Education? About Menu Academics Rankings and Reviews Student Outcomes What is a Jesuit Education? Magis Core Curriculum Creighton's Accreditation At Creighton, we’re forming leaders for a more just world. With a primary focus on giving you the best Jesuit education, we infuse Jesuit principles into both the curriculum and the student experience at Creighton. Finding God in all things is just one of the values on which St. Ignatius founded the Jesuit religious order more than 480 years ago. On campus, you’ll see members of the Jesuit community as your instructors, pastors, chaplains and university administration and staff. Our Jesuit-inspired Ratio Studiorum academic advising program encourages students to be guided by principles of ethical living, service to others, the search for truth and a passion for justice. Our students, faculty, staff and alumni are spiritually energized by Creighton’s role in the community and by the services provided by the Mission and Ministry division. Additionally, Creighton students volunteer hundreds of thousands of hours of community service each year. It’s what attending a Jesuit college is all about. Characteristics of a Jesuit Education Image Cura personalis: Translated as “care for the individual person.” Every individual—every one of God’s creations—is unique and worthy of our respect and understanding. To care for each other, we must first truly know each other. Unity of heart, mind and soul: A kind heart, an open mind, and a strong purpose work together as a personal and communal triumvirate: all three are essential to becoming one’s strongest self and to creating community. Magis: Translated as “more.” By rising above expectations and striving for “more,” for others and for God, we can serve as a lasting part of something greater than ourselves. Finding God in all things: When we learn to see every part of life—from success to adversity—as a lesson from God, we are never far from the opportunity to realize the gifts we are given. Ad majorem Dei gloriam (AMDG): Translated as “For the Greater Glory of God.” The inspiration behind everything we pursue transcends our own humanity, and those we serve in our community. It’s all for a higher purpose: the greater glory of God. Forming and educating agents of change: Identifying passions and honing skills are the first steps toward making a meaningful, lasting difference. We believe learning and leading are two sides of the same transformative coin. Women and men for and with others: Through selfless action, we can all achieve more. When we all step forward with the best versions of ourselves, we invite and enable others to do the same. Who was St. Ignatius? St. Ignatius of Loyola was born in 1491 in the Basque country of northern Spain. He was devoted to chivalry and suffered a severe leg wound in battle. During an extended recovery period, he experienced a profound conversion, and devoted the rest of his life to serving God. Ignatius died in 1556 and was canonized a saint in 1622. Ignatius left two great legacies. He founded the Society of Jesus in 1540, together with nine companions, and became their first Superior General with headquarters in Rome. He also wrote the Spiritual Exercises, a treatise on prayer. Its genius lies in the method of prayer it teaches, helping those who engage sincerely to follow Jesus and to seek God’s will in all circumstances. Today it is the basis for a growing apostolate of retreats and spiritual direction. Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities Creighton University is one of 28 Jesuit colleges and universities that comprise the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities (AJCU). The AJCU includes 27 institutions within the United States and one in Belize. The institutions range from major research universities to comprehensive universities; from smaller colleges and universities that combine the liberal arts and professional studies to one strictly liberal arts college. AJCU institutions are part of the International Association of Jesuit Universities (IAJU), a network of regional associations representing Jesuit institutions of higher learning throughout the world. My faculty-led program abroad experience reminded me of Creighton’s mission. We are called to be men and women for and with others. We are asked to work alongside those people in the world who need it most. — Jordan Lisowy, Traditional BSN student Related Links About Creighton Be a Bluejay Find Your Program Next Steps Apply Now Request Information Visit Internal Resources Directory Office 365 BlueLine NEST Libraries Bookstore Calendar myCreighton Site Index Get In Touch Contact Creighton Jobs Maps & Directions Locations Omaha, NE Phoenix, AZ 2500 California Plaza Omaha, NE 68178 402.280.2700 Select LanguageEnglishAfrikaansAlbanianArabicArmenianAzerbaijaniBasqueBelarusianBengaliBosnianBulgarianCatalanCebuanoChinese (Simplified)Chinese (Traditional)CroatianCzechDanishDutchEsperantoEstonianFilipinoFinnishFrenchGalicianGeorgianGermanGreekGujaratiHaitian CreoleHausaHebrewHindiHmongHungarianIcelandicIgboIndonesianIrishItalianJapaneseJavaneseKannadaKhmerKoreanLaoLatinLatvianLithuanianMacedonianMalayMalteseMaoriMarathiMongolianNepaliNorwegianPersianPolishPortuguesePunjabiRomanianRussianSerbianSlovakSlovenianSomaliSpanishSwahiliSwedishTamilTeluguThaiTurkishUkrainianUrduVietnameseWelshYiddishYorubaZulu © Creighton University 2022 Legal / Non-Discrimination Policy Privacy Statement Safety & Compliance LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Instagram Youtube © Creighton University 2022 LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Instagram Youtube Close Sidebar ID
