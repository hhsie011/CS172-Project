Accept Our Invitation To Explore Science And Math If you have been offered undergraduate admission to Georgia Tech, you will receive an invitation to come to one of the “EXPLORE Science and Math” visitation weekends in the College of Sciences. These weekend visits are typically held in February and April. Attend Sessions to Examine Options For Graduate Studies If you are interested in pursuing graduate studies, the College of Sciences has two visitation programs to help you explore options. Each fall semester, the College of Sciences welcomes individual undergraduate students, student groups, and classes to Research Bound in STEM, a day-long workshop for students interested in pursuing graduate studies in sciences and mathematics. Every year, over the Martin Luther King, Jr. Holiday weekend, the College of Sciences participates in Georgia Tech’s Focus Program, which aims to attract the best and brightest underrepresented minority students and encourage them to pursue graduate studies at Georgia Tech.
