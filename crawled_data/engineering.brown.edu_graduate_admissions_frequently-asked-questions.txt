Biomedical Engineering Chemical and Environmental Engineering Electrical and Computer Engineering Fluids and Thermal Sciences Materials Science Mechanics of Solids Innovation Management and Entrepreneurship (PRIME) Should I apply to the Ph.D. or Sc.M. Program? If your ultimate objective is to receive a Ph.D., you should apply to the Ph.D. Program. It is possible to be considered for the master's program if you were not accepted into the Ph.D. program - contact kathy_diorio@brown.edu. A master's degree on the way to Ph.D. is possible but it requires advisor approval. What is the PRIME Program? Is an engineering background required for applicants? The Program in Innovation Management and Entrepreneurship (PRIME) is primarily designed for students who have an engineering or science undergraduate background (this includes applied mathematics and computer science). Students from an industrial design background may qualify. For additional questions regarding this highly selective program please contact prime@brown.edu. How many courses do I need to take? Sc.M. Program requires eight (8) courses. There is also an optional thesis track Sc.M., which requires (8) courses plus completion of a research project and writing a master's thesis. Ph.D. Program has different course requirements, depending on the research group. Financial Aid Does Brown University offer financial support for incoming students? Students who are admitted to any of Brown's doctoral programs are guaranteed five years of support, including a stipend, tuition remission, health-service fee, and health-insurance subsidy. Master's students are self supported, (or often are funded by their companies.) Does Brown offer fellowships? Doctoral fellowships are awarded either by the Graduate School or the School of Engineering. It covers tuition and a monthly stipend. Recipient can take a maximum of 8 courses and conduct research with any member of the faculty. Some fellowships are named and are awarded to exceptional students. Such awards may carry additional benefits, such as travel support, etc. Does Brown offer Research Assistantships? Most of our Ph.D. students are supported with Research Assistantship (RA) appointments which pay tuition and a monthly stipend. In return, the student works with a faculty member, an average of 20 hours a week. The RA appointment is usually renewed each semester, and during summer, assuming good progress is being made towards a thesis. RAs are restricted to a maximum of three courses per semester. Does Brown offer Teaching Assistantships? A few full Teaching Assistantship (TA) positions are available, which pay for tuition and a stipend. These positions are not common and are usually given to senior graduate students. Students should not plan to support themselves through TA appointments. Additional Funding Information Some students are admitted without financial aid, but they are usually admitted to the master's degree program only. The U.S. Government will not issue a visa to a foreign student who does not have proof that they can support themselves financially.

Program Time Ph.D. It varies and depends on the student's preparation and his particular research project (typical Ph.D. programs last 4-6 years). Non-Thesis Sc.M. The prescribed sequence is three courses the first semester, three courses the second semester, and two courses the third. Thesis Sc.M. The prescribed sequence is three courses the first semester, two courses the second semester (plus research), two courses the third (plus research), and one course the final semester. How long does it take to get an Sc.M. degree? The standard non-thesis sequence is three semesters, with three courses taken in the first semester, three in the second, and two in the third. The standard thesis sequence is four semesters with three courses taken in the first semester, two courses in the second, two courses in the third semester, and one in the final semester. How does the tuition work? If I take three semesters to do the Sc.M., am I paying more than I would in two semesters? The tuition for the eight required courses is spread over three semesters, with 3/4 of a semester's tuition charged in each of the first two semesters, and 1/2 of a semester's tuition charged in the third. Any deviation in the number of courses taken per semester may result in additional tuition charges/financial penalties. Can I complete the Sc.M. in two semesters? All 5th year master's students can complete in one-year. In rare circumstances this may be possible for regular Sc.M. students, however additional tuition units will be charged. What if I don't finish my thesis after the fourth semester? We expect this case to be very uncommon, but in this case the student must leave campus with the status 'enrollment terminated, requirements pending', and the thesis work must be completed elsewhere.
