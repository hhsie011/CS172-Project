Please consult the Graduate Admissions section in this catalog for complete information. In addition, applicants must have: (1) a degree from an accredited college or university with a major in physics or a closely related field (students with majors other than physics may be admitted with deficiencies); and (2) a grade-point average of 2.75 for upper-division courses in the physics major. For students with undergraduate degrees in engineering, mathematics or other physical sciences, a GPA of 3.0 in upper-division major courses is required. Applicants are also required to: (1) take the physics portion of the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) either previously or within a year of application (the GRE requirement can be waived for physics majors who enter with a GPA of 3.6 or higher); (2) submit a one-page, 500-word maximum, typed statement of purpose, explaining the student’s interest in taking a higher degree in physics; and (3) submit three letters of recommendation. International student applicants are required to pass the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) with a score of 213 for the paper test.
