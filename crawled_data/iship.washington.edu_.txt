International students at UW are required by federal and state laws to maintain health insurance while studying in the United States. All F-1 and J-1 eligible international students who are enrolled and actively engaged in a program of study approved by the appropriate UW Principal Designated School Official (PDSO), and are temporarily outside their home country are required to purchase the UW International Student Health Insurance Plan (ISHIP) in order to meet these requirements. UW international students are automatically enrolled for student-only coverage each quarter they register for classes. International students who plan to arrive in the U.S. before the effective date of the ISHIP plan should buy short term medical coverage from an outside company during this period. Information about companies which offer supplemental short-term “GAP” medical coverage can be found on the ISS Health Insurance webpage or this Leaving UW webpage. Non-International Students ISHIP coverage is not available to UW students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Please refer to Hall Health for insurance plan options and questions.
