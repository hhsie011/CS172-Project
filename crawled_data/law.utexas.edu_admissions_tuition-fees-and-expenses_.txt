The total annual COA covers fixed expenses (e.g., tuition and fees) and reasonable living expenses for the 9 months students are enrolled for the fall and spring semesters. Individual expenses will vary based on student-specific living arrangements, whether they intend to borrow federal student loans, and personal spending decisions. The first chart shows the annual budget for first-year students taking 30 hours (16 credits in the fall/14 credits in the spring) during 2022-23. First-Year Student* First-Year Student* Expenses Resident Non-Resident Tuition & Fees $36,429 $54,096 Books & Supplies $1,500 $1,500 Room & Board $15,998 $15,998 Travel $1,618 $1,618 Misc. $4,208 $4,208 Total $59,753 $77,420 The next chart below shows the annual budget for continuing students taking 28 hours during 2022-23.

The exact figures will vary depending upon when you first started law school. Please refer to the tuition table for current rates and dual degree students should refer to the graduate dual degree program tuition tables. The information above should only be used as a guideline for estimating cost of attendance. NOTE: Federal regulations will NOT permit you to borrow funds in excess of the total amount of your Cost of Attendance budget less any scholarships or grants. Tuition Refunds Law students who withdraw from the University may receive a refund of a percentage of their tuition. Please refer to the General Catalog to determine the refund percentage based on the official withdrawal date. If a law student used federal Title IV funding to pay tuition and if the official withdrawal date is before the date that reflects 60% of the semester, then the University will assist in returning all or a portion of Title IV funds back to the federal government. In addition, scholarship recipients who withdraw must return scholarship funding back to the Law School according to the Scholarship Requirements and Policies. Please contact the Law School Financial Aid Office if there are any questions about any of these policies. Admissions and Financial Aid J.D.
