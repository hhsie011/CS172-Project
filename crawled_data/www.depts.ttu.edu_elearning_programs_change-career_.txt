Gail Alleyne-Bayne ‘17, B.A., University Studies I decided to go back to school because I wanted to work in higher education and advance my professional career to the point where I could affect change and acquire leadership and teaching roles. As a full-time student in the doctoral program in the College of Education, taking online classes afforded me the flexibility to work part-time to help pay for my education. Online learning has created lots of opportunities for students, not only from an educational perspective but also from an employment standpoint. It is global: anywhere, anyplace and anytime. We are no longer tied to classrooms — or for that matter, an office or cubicle! Want to know more about your opportunities? Let us know below!
