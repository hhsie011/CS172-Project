Apply for admission/scholarships When you apply for admission to OSU, you are automatically considered for scholarships. Current students are also automatically considered for university wide scholarships, but should apply for college-specific awards. See which scholarships you might be eligible for: Future freshman students Future transfer students Future international students Current undergraduate students Graduate students When should I apply to OSU? Applications open July 1. Competitive scholarship awarding begins December 1. Apply by February 1 to meet the deadline to be considered for most scholarship opportunities. OSU may continue to award scholarships past this priority scholarship deadline, but fund availability is not guaranteed. 2. Apply for federal/state financial aid: Complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). OSU's school code is 003170. Only an official FAFSA can be used to calculate eligibility for aid. An official FAFSA must include: All signature requirements satisfied (including parent signatures if needed). An official Expected Family Contribution (EFC). All required questions completed (no blanks or incomplete answers). Tips for filling out your FAFSA We suggest you temporarily allow pop-ups when using the FAFSA website (or if your browser has the option, select "always allow from this site"). Get an FSAID: you and your parent (if you are a dependent student) will need a U.S. Department of Education FSAID to sign your FAFSA electronically. You must be admitted as a degree-seeking student at OSU to be eligible to receive aid. If possible use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool to input your tax information. When should I apply? The FAFSA application opens October 1 for the following academic year. We encourage you to complete your application and send required documents as soon as possible. Why so early? OSU receives limited funding for the Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) and Federal Work-Study (FWS). Funding for state grants, including the Oklahoma Tuition Aid Grant (OTAG), is limited and earliest applicants receive priority for funds. What happens next? You will receive confirmation from the U.S. Department of Education that you have completed the FAFSA. Be sure to review the information you submitted and make any corrections as needed. OSU will email you to let you know we have received your FAFSA information and again if we determine we need any additional information from you. Email is sent to your OSU email address, but you must have an active O-Key account. You can also check the status of your application on OSU’s student self-service at my.okstate.edu.
