The IACUC Chair may convene additional meetings as needed. Contact the IACUC office for exact dates for scheduled meetings. SUBMISSIONS The TTU Policy requires that the use of all live vertebrate animals for research, instruction, demonstration, production, or maintenance purposes by TTU faculty, whether the animals are located in facilities at TTU or elsewhere, be approved by the IACUC in advance of their usage. Investigators/instructors who wish to use live vertebrate animals in one or more of the activities listed above are required to submit a protocol for IACUC review. The AUF is accessed through the cloud-based Cayuse Animal Oversight system found on the Forms Page, or here: Protocol Form - For Research, Teaching Or Demonstration. Completed forms will then be submitted electronically to the IACUC Office. If you have questions about the process, or need assistance accessing the system, please contact the IACUC office at iacuc@ttu.edu Protocols are either reviewed by a designated member review process or by a full-committee review process. The latter occurs at the next convened meeting of the IACUC. Protocols called for full-committee review must be received at least seven days prior to a scheduled meeting date in order to be placed on the agenda. Protocols received after the aforementioned deadline may be deferred to the following meeting. The IACUC strongly urges investigators/instructors to consult with the IACUC office before submitting a protocol to avoid delays in approval. Protocols involving pain and/or distress require consultation with the clinical or attending veterinarian.
