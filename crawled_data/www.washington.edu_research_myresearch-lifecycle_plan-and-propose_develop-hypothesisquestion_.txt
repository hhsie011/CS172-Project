Traditional application of the scientific method involves determining whether or not there exists a cause-and-effect relationship between observed phenomena. This is done by disproving the (“null”) hypothesis that there is no cause-and-effect relationship between the observed phenomena. Whatever process is used, it should not only result in a question or hypothesis statement that is both quantifiable and relevant to potential sponsors of the research. Roles The Principal Investigator (PI) is responsible for developing the hypothesis and, throughout the research project, for testing the hypothesis, and analyzing and reporting results. Plan/Act Reduce the research question to one or more individual hypotheses, each of which may be tested. State the hypothesis(es) clearly for potential sponsors of the research. Checklist Will the hypothesis, as stated, lend itself to experimental testing? Will the results of testing the hypothesis, if successful, answer the research question of interest?
