Classroom Speakers Faculty members strive to enhance the MBA experience and augment their instruction by bringing real-world practitioners into the classroom, including alumni like you. By visiting, you provide insights that allow students to see theoretical concepts at play in the real world. You also give current students a firsthand look at the post-MBA possibilities. Participating executives also gain brand exposure to potential hires, while simultaneously giving back to the aspiring business leaders of tomorrow. If you are interested in being a guest speaker or panelist and would like more information, please contact Alumni Relations at [email protected].

SPARC Students Partnering with Alumni to Reignite Connections (SPARC) is a joint initiative between student clubs and Alumni Relations that started in 2012. Each year, SPARC programming connects young alumni back to the student clubs they participated in during their academic tenure in an informal setting, usually a happy hour or cocktail reception. Past SPARC series have included a Black Business Student Association Holiday Happy Hour, Military in Business Association Networking Reception, EMBA Young Alumni-Student Happy Hour, and Cluster Q Reception. If you would like more information on SPARC events or if you would like to reconnect with the student clubs you participated in, please contact Alumni Relations at [email protected]. Uris Unplugged Uris Unplugged is a semiannual opportunity for students to engage with alumni in an informal context.
