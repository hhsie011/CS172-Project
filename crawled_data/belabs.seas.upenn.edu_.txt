Stephenson Foundation Educational Laboratory & Bio-MakerSpace, located in 225 Skirkanich Hall, is the primary teaching lab for the Department of Bioengineering at Penn Engineering. By combining Bioengineering's educational lab space with an open MakerSpace, we encourage a free flow of ideas, creativity, and entrepreneurship between Bioengineering students and students throughout Penn. This interdisciplinary lab is a Bio-MakerSpace (aka BioMakerSpace or BioMaker Space) with over 50 unique pieces of equipment and over 500 unique supplies available for molecular biology work, human and animal physiology studies, chemistry, and microfluidics; Instron test systems for mechanical testing; electrical/electronic test and prototyping equipment; and mechanical prototyping equipment, including a sewing machine, 3-D Printers, and a laser cutter. We are the only Bio-MakerSpace at Penn and in the Philadelphia area, and are open to all Penn students for personal projects as well as coursework. Access to the lab assumes acceptance of all lab policies and safety rules. Learn more about the lab in our American Society for Engineering Education paper. Lab courses are heavily project based, and students learn modeling, analysis, and design techniques involving physiological studies, instrumentation and circuit design, medical device development, biomechanics, biomaterials, microfluidics, and cell engineering.
