At Louisville Law, our commitment to diversity is demonstrated through principles of mutual respect and social justice. “We are embracing diverse perspectives,” says Professor Cedric Merlin Powell, “and we’re not only incorporating that into the institution and the classroom but also into the community.” To that end, Louisville Law’s Diversity Committee and Law Alumni Diversity Council are dedicated to enhancing the school’s culture of inclusivity. Established in 1992, the Diversity Committee hosts a number of events each year, including the Diversity Forum, where guest speakers are invited to share their experience and expertise on a host of topics such as affirmative action, marriage rights, racial profiling, voting rights, disability advocacy and reproductive justice. Meanwhile, the Law Alumni Diversity Council assists in the recruitment and retention of qualified students underrepresented in the legal profession. In tandem, our signature partnership with Central High School works to develop the interest of secondary students of color in becoming lawyers, leaders and active citizens in the community. Promoting a diverse student body also means ensuring that legal education, programs and services are fully and equally accessible to those with learning disabilities, mobility issues, visual or auditory impairments and other needs. Our Office of Student Affairs & Diversity is happy to assist current and future students with the disability documentation process and the coordination of appropriate accommodations. The University of Louisville is proud to be consistently recognized as a leader in diversity and inclusion among institutions of higher education. For the sixth year in a row, we have been named by Campus Pride among the Best of the Best LGBTQ-Friendly Colleges & Universities nationwide, and for the seventh year in a row, we have been presented the Higher Education Excellence in Diversity Award by INSIGHT Into Diversity and designated one of its fourteen 2020 Diversity Champions.
