Podcasts GSAPP’s podcast series offers a window onto the expanding field of contemporary architectural practice through discussions on the current projects, research, and obsessions of a diverse group of invited guests from emerging and well-established practices 2021 End of Year Show Celebrating the 2020-2021 academic year by showcasing student work from across the School’s degree programs: Architecture; Urban Design; Urban Planning; Historic Preservation; Critical, Curatorial, and Conceptual Practices; and Real Estate Development. Discover Campus and Explore Morningside Heights Columbia GSAPP collaborated with Untapped New York – co-founded by Alumni Board Member Michelle Young (‘12 M.S.UP) – to create a mini-series of podcast episodes designed to explore the architectural and historic highlights of the University and related New York City neighborhoods. In the first episode, they discuss five spots including Columbia’s Alma Mater sculpture, the Guastavino Dome at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Riverside Church’s Labyrinth, Ulysses S. Grant’s Tomb, and the meeting of 125th and 129th Streets. In the second installment, Michelle Young and Justin Rivers explore neighborhoods in Upper Manhattan where many of GSAPP’s students choose to live. They head from Morningside Heights to Harlem, Hamilton Heights, Washington Heights, and Inwood. Along the way, they point out culinary and cultural highlights of each neighborhood, including NYC’s largest slice at Koronet Pizza in Morningside Heights, Harlem’s Apollo Theater, the Audubon Mural Project in Hamilton Heights, and the many parks and views of Washington Heights. We also hear from Columbia affiliated residents of Harlem and Washington Heights who tell us about why they love their neighborhoods.
