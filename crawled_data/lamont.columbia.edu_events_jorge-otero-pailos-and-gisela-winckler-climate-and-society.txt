Complex phenomena such as the climate crisis are so multidimensional that they need more than just a scientific or technological lens; instead the combined expertise of researchers in social and human behavior, culture, politics and policy, economics, communication, and other areas must be brought to bear. This series will showcase the work of leading scholars and Columbia researchers on climate, environment, sustainability and their social and cultural dimensions. Event Speakers Jorge Otero-Pailos, Professor of Architecture, Planning and Preservation at Columbia University Gisela Winckler, Lamont Research Professor at Columbia University Event Information Free and open to the public; registration required to receive Zoom link.
