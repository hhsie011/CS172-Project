Penn Center for Musculoskeletal Disorders NIH Grant Renewed - The United States’ longest-running NIH-sponsored musculoskeletal research center will receive $4M to continue its studies of everything from ligament tears to osteoarthritis. For more information https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2021/august/penn-center-for-musculoskeletal-disorders-nih-grant-renewed The overall goal of the Penn Center for Musculoskeletal Disorders (PCMD) to promote cooperative interactions among investigators, accelerate and enrich the effectiveness and efficiency of ongoing research, foster new collaborations and new research, and ultimately, translate our research efforts into better and new therapies for musculoskeletal disorders. Our PCMD is the home for musculoskeletal research across the Penn campus and a hub for the musculoskeletal community across the region and neighboring states. The overall Aims of this Center are to enhance and advance the research productivity of investigators in musculoskeletal development, disease, injury and repair by providing: Aim 1: Innovation within critical resource core facilities in areas that cross disciplines, length scales, and hierarchies. These core facilities are mCT Imaging, Biomechanics, and Histology; Aim 2: A pilot and feasibility grant program, with direct mentorship; and Aim 3: Educational and research enrichment programs, through which members can learn from national leaders and from each other. The Center will provide opportunities to integrate techniques to define mechanisms for tissue function, injury, development, degeneration, repair, and regeneration, with the ultimate goal of advancing diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases and injuries of the musculoskeletal system. ACKNOWLEDGING THE PCMD Remember to include reference to support from the Center in your abstracts and publications. Cite Grant NIH/NIAMS P30AR069619 from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases of the NIH. Support has also been provided by the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.
