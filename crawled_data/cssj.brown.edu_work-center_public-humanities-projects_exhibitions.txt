We see public history as a means to share and make relevant the work of scholars to our community on and off campus through exhibitions, public programs, and educational resources. This public history work aims to share a more nuanced understanding of the past by connecting the public to historic images, documents, and contemporary art as well as the innovative work done by scholars to read history differently and conceptualize new ideas about the lives of enslaved peoples. In our new building there is a gallery space where we will host revolving exhibitions that cover a range of issues. This gallery is central to the mission of creating "a public curriculum." For interest in bringing a student group to the Center, please email cssj_youthprograms@brown.edu.
