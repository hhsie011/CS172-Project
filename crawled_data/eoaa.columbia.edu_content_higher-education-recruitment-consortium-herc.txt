HERC catalyzes inclusive excellence in the academic workforce and assists in building a diverse pipeline of faculty, staff, and executives in academia through outreach, advertising, career advice, and job opportunities. HERC also provides its 700+ member institutions with networks and resources to bolster equitable, inclusive recruitment and retention practices. Through an on-line member portal, HERConnect, HERC offers expertise in the areas of diversity and inclusion in the higher education workforce; equitable recruitment practices; best practices for work-life in academia; and dual career couples. The Metro NY & Southern Connecticut HERC was established in 2007 with Columbia University as the region’s lead institution in collaboration with NYU and Yale. Together, along with over 30 other regional members MNYSC HERC advances the ability of member institutions to recruit and retain the most diverse and talented workforce and to assist dual career couples. HERC offers a unique job board that centralizes job postings for faculty and staff positions at all member institutions and accommodates dual career searches. The site also explicitly includes jobs for research scientists and post-doctoral candidates. Across all disciplines, the availability of employment for a candidate’s partner greatly enhances the likelihood of a successful hire. HERC supports dual career couples through a dual career search and a network of connections with employers within and beyond higher education. The ability to place a candidate’s partner is especially desirable in cases where recruiting the primary candidate enhances our faculty’s racial and gender diversity.
