Safe Treat will be hosted in the C-1 parking lot of Texas Tech University by Jones AT&T Stadium. Guests can access this lot by entering campus on Glenna Goodacre Blvd from University Parkway. The event will accommodate the first 250 guests that arrive. Attendees will not be allowed outside of their vehicles and will be asked to open their windows to collect goodies and candy. Each complex has prepared a take-home activity and a movie-themed tent to be on display during the event. Bags have been prepared with all of the activities and candy. All are welcome, but the event is geared towards children ages 2 through 12. Safe Treat is sponsored by the Texas Tech RHA and Complex Councils. The Residence Halls Association (RHA) is comprised of all students who live in the residence halls of Texas Tech University. The objective of RHA is to promote residence hall life, develop new student leaders, and act as the official voice of the students living in the residence halls. For more information, please contact the Residence Halls Association.
