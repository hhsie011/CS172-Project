Administered by the Department of Integrative Biology under the School of Life Sciences. The undergraduate BS degree in Biology is designed for students seeking an interdisciplinary background in the life sciences. The major couples a comprehensive biological, physical and quantitative sciences core with a variety of electives that can be catered to meet diverse professional goals. Undergraduate research, internship, teaching and study abroad experience are strongly recommended, and credits can be integrated with major requirements. Biology majors receive excellent training for graduate and professional programs. Corvallis Campus students may choose to complete one transcript-visible option in Ecology, Genetics, Marine Biology, Physiology and Behavior, Pre-Dentistry/Biology, Pre-Education Biology, Pre-Medicine/Biology, or Pre-Veterinary Medicine. Options in the Biology major require fifteen or fewer additional credits (one term) beyond the basic Biology major, and most students can complete the additional option course work in four years. Major Code: 509 Explain and apply the fundamental concepts of the biological sciences, including inquiry in these four areas: PO1-A Cell Biology and Biochemistry; PO1-B Molecular Biology and Genetics; PO1-C Organismal Biology; and PO1-D Ecology and Evolution. Explain and apply the fundamental concepts in cell biology and biochemistry. Explain and apply the fundamental concepts in molecular biology and genetics. Explain and apply fundamental concepts in organismal biology. explain and apply fundamental concepts in population genetics, evolution and ecology. Apply the process of science through three different aspects. Access primary literature, identify relevant works for a particular topic, and evaluate the scientific content of these works. Formulate testable hypotheses based on observation, gather data to address these hypotheses and analyze those data to assess the degree to which their hypothesis is supported. Employ fundamental quantitative and statistical principles to present and critique scientific findings. Communicate scientific information through effective formal and informal writing and speaking in a format used by practicing scientists. Integrate and analyze information across levels of organization ranging from biochemistry and molecular biology to ecosystems within the biological sciences to formulate arguments and critically evaluate scientific claims. Conduct background research and apply fundamental biological science principles to make informed decisions on socio-scientific issues. Students in the Biology major must complete BI 221, BI 222 and BI 223 (or the honors version of this series) with a C– or better to continue on to upper-division Biology (BI) and Zoology (Z) coursework. Students must also complete CH 231/CH 261, CH 232/CH 262 or CH 233/CH 263 and CH 331 and CH 332 with a C– or better to continue on to upper-division Chemistry (CH) coursework. Students majoring in Biology cannot seek a dual or double major in Biochemistry and Biophysics, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, BioHealth Sciences, Microbiology or Zoology. Declaring an option can modify the statistics and elective areas of the major. For further information, see MyDegrees or the Integrative Biology website.
