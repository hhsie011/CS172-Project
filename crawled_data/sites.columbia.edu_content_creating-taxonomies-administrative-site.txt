You can add pages as needed at any time. However, setting up your taxonomy first will save you a lot of time down the road. Many pages use taxonomy in their setup. If you create these pages before creating the taxonomy referenced, you will need to go back and update the page later or, in some cases, not be able to create the page in the first place. For the administrative Columbia Sites website, there are three taxonomy groups that need to get set: Document library taxonomy terms: document categories, document topics News article taxonomy terms: topics People profiles taxonomy terms: positions, groups, departments Services taxonomy terms: department, audience, category From the main menu, click Shortcuts and then Taxonomy to see all the taxonomy categories. Explanation of terms Document Categories and Document Topics: Used when creating a document for a document library News Topics: Used when creating a news article. This creates a news kicker above the article title. Positions, Profile Group, Person Profile Department: Used when creating a person profile. These terms become the mechanisms from which users can sort profiles. Service Department, Service Audience, Service Category: Used for creating services. These terms become the mechanisms from which users can sort service offerings. Click List terms for the taxonomy you want. Click Add term if you need to create another item for the category. Add terms. Click Save.
