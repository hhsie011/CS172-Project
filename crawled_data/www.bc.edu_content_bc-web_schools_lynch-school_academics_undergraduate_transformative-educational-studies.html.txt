Focus on key questions impacting education: What does it mean to be an educated person? Is schooling primarily a force for social reproduction or social change? How will education evolve in light of paradigmatic shifts in the nature of technology and media, literacy and work? What type of learning leads to personal and social transformation? How will education respond to contemporary social, environmental, and health crises? What does it mean to be an educator? How to serve diverse and increasingly globalized student populations?
