Create your Library Reserves Whether you want to reuse materials you requested in the past, or you want to request something new, we can help. Create a list of what you need in Canvas, and we will find or create a digital copy. If you need us to make a physical copy available instead, note that in your request. We encourage you to include items that you know the library does not own; we'll figure it out. GO TO Canvas Things to know : If we can't locate an exisiting digital version, we can use a physical copy to create a digital copy. If you include a date-needed-by in your request, we will do our best to accommodate. Not everything available digitally has unlimited access. We will do our best to optimize availability within copyright restrictions. Course Reserves, by School Have a question about setting up reserves for your course? Find help by School.
