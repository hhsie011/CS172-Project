For department majors, this course satisfies the Group 1 distribution requirement. Two 90-minute classes.

ANT 305 / HLS 305 Psychological Anthropology Professor/InstructorElizabeth Anne Davis This seminar addresses the social relations in which mental health, mental illness, and psycho-medical knowledge are entangled and produced. We will engage various cross-cultural approaches to mental conflicts and pathologies: psychoanalysis, ethnopsychology, biomedical psychiatry, transcultural psychiatry, and religious and "alternative" practices of diagnosis and healing. Drawing on ethnographic and clinical studies from Greek and other contexts, we will examine the role of culture in determining lines between normal and pathological, and consider the intertwining of psyche and body in human experience and behavior. CLG 310 / COM 388 / HLS 309 Topics in Greek Literature Professor/InstructorBrooke A. Holmes The subject matter of the course will vary from year to year depending on the interests of the instructor and students.

We will read translations of the four surviving novels written in twelfth-century Constantinople in a bid to answer questions about the link between eroticism and the novel, truth and invention in the middle ages, who read fiction and why, and what role, if any, did the medieval or Byzantine Romances have in the story of the European novel.
