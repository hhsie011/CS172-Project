Here are some tips and links to help you get up to speed. Finding Materials The search bar on our home page is the place to start your search. Here you can conduct a broad search for almost everything, and you can use the left-hand drop down if you are looking for a specific type of item. You can also visit our Finding Library Materials page if you’re having a hard time finding something. Looking for an article? The list below includes some of our most popular search databases, and you can visit our Library Databases for a list of all the databases we currently have available.

Instead of children, can you try: child, adolescent, youth, etc. Clemson University Libraries 116 Sigma Drive, Clemson, SC 29634 864-656-3027 Directory Employment Contact Us
