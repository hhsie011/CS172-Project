During this unprecedented crisis, global competence education is now more important than ever before. Therefore, the Beijing Center has launched a thematic symposia series in partnership with Teachers College at Columbia University, Beijing Normal University School of Arts and Communication, and BNU-ANOBO Children's Global Competence Research Committee. We invited numerous global education leaders, scholars, and entrepreneurs to discuss the role of education and educators in helping people develop global competence and how they can continue to evolve, innovate, and achieve better performances. On December 19, 2020, in celebration of the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Center on Chinese Education (CoCE) at Columbia Teachers College and to pay tribute to the founding director, Professor Mun C. Tsang, for his outstanding and tireless work on educational collaboration between China and Teachers College, the Beijing Center co-hosted a forum titled “Cross- Fertilization of Culture and Education: U.S.-China Education Forum” to reflect on meaningful collaboration among US-China educators, strong historical ties between Teachers College and counterparts in China, and stimulate deeper cooperation. The Beijing Center also facilitated conversations on reform and innovation in education. Thomas Hatch, Professor of Education at Teachers College, talked about his new book, The Education We Need for a Future We Can't Predict, detailing his vision of efficient, effective, and equitable schools.
