Taught by Professors of Film from Columbia University School of the Arts, the Television Writing Intensives offer an introductory workshop, January 6-8, 2016, and an advanced workshop, January 11-13, 2016. Each workshop will have around 15 students, providing for individual script advising in addition to the main course of study. Novelist, Screenwriter, and Playwright, Trey Ellis, Professor of Film at Columbia University School of the Arts in New York, will be the primary instructor for the workshops. The entire program will be in English, so fluency in the language is mandatory. All assignments should also be written in English.
