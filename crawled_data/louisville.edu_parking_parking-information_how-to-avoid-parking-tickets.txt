We hope this helps you learn the campus parking system to avoid frustration and possibly any future fines. The key to avoiding parking tickets at UofL is to know the rules. All vehicles parking on campus from 7:30am to 7:30pm, Monday through Friday, must display a valid UofL parking permit, pay to park at a meter or us any of the hourly pay parking lots. Resident lots are enforced 24 hours per day, seven days per week. A valid resident permit must be displayed at all times in these locations. Permits must be displayed properly in the vehicle. Hangtag permits must be displayed on the rearview mirror with the numbers facing out. Adhesive permits must be displayed on the driver's side of the rear bumper. Motorcycle permits must be displayed on the back of the license plate. All lots have signs indicating the permit colors allowed. Parking restrictions are in effect weekdays from 7:30am until 5:00pm. Some areas (resident, handicap, etc.) are enforced at all times. It is very important to read and understand the signs and regulations. Posted signs, whether permanent or temporary, must be obeyed. Signs take precedence over painted curbs, pavement markings, and designations shown on University maps. If you park illegally and do not find a ticket on your car, do not assume you were not ticketed or it was okay for you to park there. You are responsible for any tickets to your permit or vehicle. Hangtag permits may be used in any vehicle the permit holder is parking on campus. Ownership of parking permits remains with the University and permits are not transferable. Permits must be returned to the University: (1) If no longer employed by the University or enrolled as a student at the University; (2) when a replacement permit is issued to take the place of a previously issued permit; (3) when the permit is revoked; or (4) when in possession of a reported lost/stolen permit. If a parking ticket is received, please do not ignore it. Appeal or pay the ticket within 7 calendar days of the ticket issue date online or in the parking offices. Tickets are billed first to the permit holder and then to the vehicle’s registered owner if no permit is displayed. Permit holders are responsible for all tickets issued to their permit, regardless of vehicle ownership. Members of the university community will be responsible for any citations issued to vehicles registered to family members. Parking permits may not be purchased on accounts with outstanding citations. Students may not receive diplomas or transcripts with outstanding parking citations. Vehicles may be towed and impounded until account balances are paid in full. If vehicle has been towed, contact the University Parking Office at 852-7275. © University of Louisville Contact Privacy Statement Apply Undergraduate Transfer Graduate Dentistry Law Medicine MBA International Online Learning Jobs Donate Emergency Login Email ULink PeopleSoft HR PeopleSoft Campus Solutions PeopleSoft Financials Blackboard Business Ops CardSmart CardBox Cards Career Connection Plone Contact Privacy Statement Apply Undergraduate Transfer Graduate Dentistry Law Medicine MBA International Online Learning Campuses Belknap HSC Online Jobs Donate Emergency Login Email ULink PeopleSoft HR PeopleSoft Campus Solutions PeopleSoft Financials Blackboard Business Ops CardSmart CardBox Cards Career Connection Plone © University of Louisville
