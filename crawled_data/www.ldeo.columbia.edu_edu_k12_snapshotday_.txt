Event Description: The event is designed to celebrate the Hudson River Estuary and educate participants on the uniqueness of our estuary as part of the annual recognition of "National Estuaries Week". The event is coordinated by The Hudson River Estuary Program of New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. Each fall, environmental education centers are encouraged to team with school classes along the Hudson River to create a day-in-the-life picture of the river from the Troy Dam to New York Harbor. The event began in 2003 with a modest 300 student participants and has grown until in our most recent events we involved over 5000 students and individual participants ~ 90 sites from the New York Bight up to Peebles Island on the Hudson River, and into the Mohawk watershed, a major Hudson River tributary. Each site gathers data on the Hudson and shares their results, gaining a better understanding of this historic and vital estuary system as they build data literacy. Data, Lesson Plans, Resources...lots of resource materials are provided here for your use in joining us on a virtual exploration of the river...and plan to join us on in 2022 for your own dip in the Hudson River as part of our Day in the Life on the Hudson River! Check out the results page! While you wait to participate in 2021, why not build your skills and enjoy this video from 2021 collecting data as you explore the different parts of the estuary.
