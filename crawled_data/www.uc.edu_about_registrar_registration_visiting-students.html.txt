FAQs—Registration Registration for Visiting Students The Basic Data Form collects basic information from visiting students (students who wish to take classes for credit without being enrolled in a degree program). Here at UC, we call these students "non-matriculated students" because they have not matriculated into a degree program. Other colleges or universities may refer to these students as nondegree–seeking students. The information in the Basic Data Form is required for the Office of the Registrar to create an account for non-matriculated students in order for them to have access to the registration system, Catalyst. Registration Steps 1) Complete the Basic Data Form Submit a Basic Data Form Basic Data Form users who are experiencing an eAccessibility barrier may Report an eAccessibility Concern.
