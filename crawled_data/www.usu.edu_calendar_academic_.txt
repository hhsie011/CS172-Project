No-Test Days Policy × For classes that meet for a full semester, a five-day period designated as "no-test" days precedes final examinations. During this time, no major examinations, including final examinations will be given in order that students may concentrate on preparation for duly scheduled final examinations. Approved exceptions include: final papers, weekly chapter quizzes, quizzes, projects, and examinations associated with a lab that does not meet during final examinations. The No-Test Days policy does not apply to classes that are part of a 7-week session or to classes offered during the summer term. Where possible, it is highly recommended that due dates for papers, projects, or assignments that are worth a significant portion of a student's grade have deadlines that occur the week prior to No-Test Days and two weeks prior to final examinations. This not only honors the spirit of no-test days, but allows faculty more flexibility to grade these assignments before final grades are due. Close Want to learn more about USU?
