We will seek healing and rejuvenation as we stay in a historic ranch house near Oak Creek and later explore the natural beauty of the area by hiking Broken Arrow Trail, Airport Mesa Trail, and Devil's Bridge Trail. While strolling around the town we will find and visit the various shops, art works, and restaurants! Before our departure, we will have the opportunity of witnessing petroglyphs and well-preserved cliff dwellings.
