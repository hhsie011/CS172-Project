Your membership will last for one year from the date it is received, and comes with some additional benefits beyond those available to all alumni. Donations to the UC Alumni Association support our programming and enable us to sustain a strong organization to serve the university and its graduates. Your gift may be designated to any UCAA fund, including the UC Fund for the Alumni Association (supporting our greatest needs and programming) or UCAA scholarships. Your support is greatly appreciated. It enables us to further our mission of supporting the university by maintaining a strong, vibrant alumni community. Every great university needs a solid alumni foundation – and Loyal Bearcats are key to the overall success of UC.
