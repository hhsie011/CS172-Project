Their company, Filmakers, would be an early pioneer of independent feature films. Clearly influenced by Italian neo-realism, Lupino's works tackled a number of female-oriented, and uncomfortable, subjects: unwanted pregnancy, rape, female athletes, bigamy; even the ex-First Lady of the US, Eleanor Roosevelt, commented on the importance of her work. Yet at a time of increasing economic and political troubles, Lupino’s films never escaped the margins of B movie production, and consequently her career as a director has largely been forgotten. This talk will focus on Lupino’s unique career as a film director, including clips and a screening of her film OUTRAGE (1950). Biography Richard Peña has been at Columbia since 1989, becoming full time in 1996 and being named Professor of Professional Practice in 2003; from 2006 - 2009 was a Visiting Professor in Spanish at Princeton University. Mr. Peña has also served as the Program Director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Director of the New York Film Festival from 1988 to 2012.
