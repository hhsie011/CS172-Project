Now, researchers have created a ‚Äúliquid wire‚Äù that, when injected into pig hearts, can guide the organs to a normal rhythm. Professor Elizabeth Cosgriff-Hernandez presented this new development at the American Chemical Society. Read more ... Hyun Jung Kim has been developing his "gut-on-a-chip" technology for more than a decade. These miniature systems represent accurate models of the patient's own gut, as well as the disease simulation. The aim is to use the patients‚Äô own cells to test drugs and understand disease processes to determine the right treatment for the patient. Read more ... Researchers at The University of Texas at Austin have developed new guidelines for fabricating nanoscale gel materials, or nanogels, that can deliver numerous therapeutic treatments to treat cancer in a precise manner. In addition to enabling the delivery of drugs in response to tumors, their nanogels can target malignant cells (or biomarkers), degrade into nontoxic components and execute multiple clinical functions.
