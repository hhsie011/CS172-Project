Tyler Painting majors are pushed to grow as artists and critical thinkers by a diverse faculty—all of whom are practicing artists themselves—with a broad range of expertise and a commitment to being engaged, passionate mentors. Students learn technique, theory and perhaps the most powerful tool of all: how to teach themselves to be self-critical. Tyler BFA students take full advantage of the school's location in Philadelphia, a vibrant art center, to explore museums and galleries, find internships, earn placements in competitive graduate programs and launch creative practices. When they graduate, they join an alumni community that includes some of the most influential artists, thought leaders and teachers of their time. Degree Requirements The Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Painting may be conferred upon a student by recommendation of the faculty and upon the satisfactory completion of a minimum of 126 semester hours of credit with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00. All Painting majors must complete the BFA curriculum and General Education requirements. Students must earn a C- or better in Painting (ART 2501 or ART 2503) and Intermediate or Digital Drawing (ART 2502, ART 2504, ART 2507, ART 2508 or ART 3511) to enter the Painting major.
