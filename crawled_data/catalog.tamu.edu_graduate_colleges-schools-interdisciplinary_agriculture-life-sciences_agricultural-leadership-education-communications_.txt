Cummings The Department of Agricultural Leadership, Education, and Communications offers graduate studies leading to the degrees of: Master of Agriculture in agricultural development, a degree program approved for distance education delivery, and three campus degree program options, Master of Science (Thesis) option, Master of Science (Non-Thesis option), and Doctor of Philosophy, all of which major in agricultural leadership, education, and communications. Professionals completing these degrees work in a variety of contextual settings including agricultural communications/journalism, organizational and community leadership, extension education, instructional design and delivery, international agricultural development, and teacher education. Departmental faculty members maintain contact with professionals in their field. These contacts enable faculty members to teach and direct research in support of graduate programs with an appreciation of the important and complex problems encountered by professional practitioners. The faculty provide leadership to international and national organizations within the discipline. Students will benefit from the faculty members’ different research inquiries, professional interests, perspectives and knowledge. Master's Programs Three Master’s degree program options are available for individuals interested in career areas such as public relations account manager, communications coordinator, agricultural science teacher, sales representative, county extension agent, leadership consultant, social and public service, instructional designer, and international development specialist. Because of the diverse social and behavioral sciences nature of these careers, degree plans will vary considerably and are generally unique for each individual's career aspirations. For more information about the degree programs, visit the specific degree program page. Master of Science (Thesis option) Master of Science (Non-Thesis option) Master of Agriculture Doctoral Programs The Department offers a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Agricultural Leadership, Education, and Communications. The PhD is a campus-based degree program and a specialized, research-oriented degree. The program prepares individuals for university faculty positions, opportunities in natural resource management, extension education, international development, public and corporate leadership roles in education, and many other professional careers in agriculture and life sciences. Coursework gives the candidate a thorough and comprehensive knowledge in the field of study and methods of research. For more information about the degree programs, visit the degree program page. Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) For additional information about the graduate faculty and programs available in the department, contact the program coordinator or visit the ALEC website. Certificates The Department offers four certificate programs that will enable individuals to gain specific knowledge and skillsets. All certificates are available for students in our department and from other departments across campus. The Agriculture eLearning Development and the Leadership Theory certificates are approved for distance education delivery, however some courses may also be offered as campus-based courses. The Extension and International Agriculture certificates are obtained by completing synchronous campus-based courses, however some courses may also be completed via distance education delivery. All departmental certificates may be completed as: 1) Part of a degree program, 2) by applying as a certificate option only (non-degree status), or 3) continuing education. For more information about each certificate program, click on the certificate program tab above or visit the links below. Certificate in Advanced Pedagogy in Agriculture Certificate in Agriculture eLearning Development Certificate in Extension Education Certificate in International Agriculture Certificate in Leadership Education, Theory, and Practice Cost to Complete a Certificate All certificates offered by the department may be completed in an academic degree program, in certificate only status (non-degree) as academic credit (active enrollment at Texas A&M University), or by Continuing Education. If an individual is not currently enrolled at Texas A&M University, completion of the certificate courses and "transcripted" completion on a university transcript is obtained by enrolling at Texas A&M University by submitting an certificate only application (non-degree). If accepted, students will complete the courses for academic credit. These courses may be applied towards a degree program in the department. Completing the certificate in this status requires that academic credit is based on Texas A&M University tuition and fees. Review tuition and fee charges on the Student Business Services website. Tuition and fees charges may be subject to change. Individuals not wishing to enroll academically at Texas A&M University, may inquire about completing a certificate as Continuing Education. Cost of continuing education credit is currently $525/course and may be subject to change. No continuing education credit units are awarded. A certificate completed through continuing education will not be listed on a university transcript, and many people prefer "transcripted" certificate programs. The expenses related to required software or textbooks is not included in the fees associated with Texas A&M tuition and/or fees for the certificate. For more information about completing a transcripted certificate program or a non-transcripted certificate through Continuing Education, visit the ALEC Certificate website.
