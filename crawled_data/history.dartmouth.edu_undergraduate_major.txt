Students in the Class of 2024 and beyond, please refer to the Major Requirements for Students in the Class of 2024 and Beyond section of this page. This information can also be found in the ORC on the Registrar's website. Major Requirements for Students in the Class of 2023 and Before Refer to the Class of 2023 and Before History Major Worksheet for the successful completion of at least ten History courses meeting the requirements. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION Your ten History courses must include, at a minimum: One course from the United States (such courses are designated Major Dist: US); One course from the history of Europe (designated Major Dist: EUR); Two courses from the histories of Africa, Asia, Latin America & Caribbean (designated Major Dist: AALAC); One Interregional or Comparative history course (designated Major Dist: INTER). CHRONOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION Your ten History courses must contain, at a minimum, two pre-1700 or three pre-1800 courses. On the course schedule pages, courses fulfilling the pre-1700 requirement are designated <1700, while <1800 designates those fulfilling the pre-1800 requirement. SEMINARS AND COLLOQUIA All majors in the department must complete two courses involving advanced historical practice, one of which will represent the culminating experience. Most students meet this requirement by enrolling in two 96s, which are small courses (normally capped at 12) that allow students to work closely with a faculty member and to produce a final project that represents either original research in primary sources or (with colloquia) a historiographical contribution to the existing scholarly literature. Those who complete the London FSP or the Honors' Seminar need to complete only one 96, which represents the culminating experience for the major. Careful advanced planning regarding enrollment in 96s is necessary for two reasons. First, the capped enrollment means that several 96s will have more students who wish to take the course than there are available spots. In these cases, the department and the instructor will prioritize enrollment. Second, work at the advanced level is most rewarding when it builds upon previous exposure to a field. You should work with your adviser to consider which seminars can best represent this sequencing model that follows exposure to a topic in introductory and upper-level classes. LIMITS AND EXCLUSIONS At least five History courses must be taken in residence at Dartmouth College, one of them being HIST 96. HIST 7 (First-Year Seminar) and History 99 (Honors Thesis) may not be counted toward the Standard Major. Students may not include more than two of the following courses: HIST 1, 2 or 3. Students may not use more than two independent study courses (HIST 97) in satisfying the requirements of the Standard Major. Only those major courses passed with a letter grade may be counted in satisfaction of the major. Courses taken under the Non-Recording Option (NRO) may not be used toward completion of the major. Major GPA is figured on all History courses taken. The Department will consider approving transfer credits for History majors and non-majors only for History courses taken at institutions with which Dartmouth College has institutional exchange programs. Major Requirements for Students in the Class of 2024 and Beyond Refer to the Class of 2024 and Beyond History Major Worksheet for the successful completion of at least ten History courses meeting the requirements. GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION For the purposes of the major requirements applicable to the class of 2024 and later, most courses fall into one of six areas: (1) Africa, (2) Asia, (3) Europe, (4) Latin America & the Caribbean, (5) Middle East, (6) United States. Your ten History courses must include one course from at least four of these six areas. CHRONOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION Your ten History courses must include, at a minimum, two pre-modern courses and two modern courses. SEMINARS AND COLLOQUIA All majors in the department must complete two courses involving advanced historical practice, one of which will represent the culminating experience. Most students meet this requirement by enrolling in two 96s, which are small courses (normally capped at 12) that allow students to work closely with a faculty member and to produce a final project that represents either original research in primary sources or (with colloquia) a historiographical contribution to the existing scholarly literature. Those who complete the London FSP or the Honors' Seminar need to complete only one 96 on campus. For FSP students, their on campus 96 will be the culminating experience. For students in the Honors Program, the honors thesis will be the culminating experience. Careful advanced planning regarding enrollment in 96s is necessary for two reasons. First, the capped enrollment means that several 96s will have more students wishing to take the course than available space. In these cases, the department and the instructor will prioritize enrollment. Second, work at the advanced level is most rewarding when it builds upon previous exposure to a field. Students should work with their advisers to select a number of classes related to a geographic, chronological, or thematic area that will prepare them for their advanced coursework. Students should then consider which seminars can best build on this previous coursework.

Only transfer students may receive credit for courses taken at other colleges or universities prior to matriculation at Dartmouth.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of History Undergraduate Overview History FAQs for First Year and Transfer Students How to Declare a Major or Minor in History Major Modified Major Minor Transfer Credit Policy Course Descriptions First-Year Seminars Introductory Africa, Asia, Latin America & The Caribbean (AALAC) Europe (EUR) Interregional & Comparative (INTER) United States (US) Seminars & Colloquia Independent Study & Honors Course Schedule 2021-2022 Schedule 2022-2023 Schedule 2023-2024 Schedule Course Syllabi Honors Thesis Program General Timeline Guidelines for the Class of 2022 Guidelines for the Class of 2023 Honors Theses By Year Phi Alpha Theta Honors Society Prizes After Graduation Alumni Update Research Overview Faculty Research Initiatives Dartmouth History Institute Student Research Initiatives and Resources The Dartmouth Vietnam Project History Librarian Research Funding Resources Undergraduate Research Database Student Class Projects Foreign Study News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
