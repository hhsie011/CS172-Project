IB Credits Advanced Placement (AP Credit) Clemson University strongly endorses the College Board’s Advanced Placement (AP) Program and consistently ranks among the top colleges and universities in the nation in the number of students reporting AP grades. Students who have participated in AP are attracted by, and in turn contribute to, the superior academic environment at Clemson. Clemson University credit is awarded for grades of 3, 4 or 5 on AP examinations. If you enroll in AP courses through your high school, you’ll have the opportunity to take a national examination at the end of the school year. When registering for the exam, indicate if you wish to have the final results sent to Clemson University (CEEB #5111). The exams are graded on a 1 to 5 scale, and if you achieve a 3 or higher, you’ll receive the appropriate course credit as outlined in the AP credit chart below. AP examination grades should be sent directly to Clemson from the College Board; specific information can be found in the Academic Catalog. You will receive notification from Clemson outlining any course credit that you will receive through the AP program.
