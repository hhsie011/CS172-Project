The program is designed for: (1) general liberal arts students who wish to learn more about the Middle East; (2) students who wish to pursue graduate work in this field; and (3) students who seek employment in or relating to the Middle East. The Middle East Center, housed in the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics, administers the major. A Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Middle Eastern Studies responds directly to a national and regional demand for resources and information to educate students, professionals, and the surrounding community about this important region of the world. An increasing number of jobs are available nationally and throughout the world for those with expertise in the Middle East and its languages. For more information, please refer to https://mec.fsu.edu/. Admission Students must complete fifty-two semester hours with an adjusted GPA of 2.0 on all University coursework and have completed at least half the required liberal studies hours or an AA degree. Requirements for a Major in Middle Eastern Studies Students majoring in Middle Eastern studies are to construct their study program, in consultation with an advisor, around three components in addition to the University requirement for liberal studies and electives. A total of fifty-four semester hours beyond the liberal studies requirement is required. A list of approved courses is available with the program advisors or online at https://mec.fsu.edu/. Major Components for a BA in Middle Eastern Studies Major requirement. Students are to take a minimum of thirty-six semester hours from among those area-specific upper level courses listed for their major track. The hours should be distributed among at least three departments participating in the program. Middle East Seminar requirement. Students are required to take Middle East Research: An Interdisciplinary Seminar (ASH 3230), a three semester hour course. Language requirement. Fifteen semester hours of coursework are required in a relevant area language (Arabic, Hebrew, or any other Middle Eastern language that might be offered on campus in the future). The hours must be focused upon one specific language. Students are encouraged to bring their chosen language up to an effective level of proficiency in both reading and speaking by either taking additional coursework on the FSU campus or by participating in a semester or Summer abroad program in their relevant cultural area as such programs are available. To encourage the achievement of language proficiency, language coursework hours taken beyond the fourth semester of foreign language requirement may be counted toward the required thirty-six hours for the major. A separate minor is not currently required for the Middle Eastern studies major, as a secondary area of major coursework constitutes a collateral minor. A minimum of twenty-one hours have to be taken at Florida State University. State of Florida Common Program Prerequisites The state of Florida has not identified common program prerequisites for this University degree program; however, students are encouraged to take lower level introductory courses in some of the related disciplines (e.g., culture/history courses relating to the Middle East) and to begin study in Arabic or Hebrew earlier so that they might be able to leave the program with the highest level of proficiency possible in their chosen language. Computer Skills Competency All undergraduates at Florida State University must demonstrate basic computer skills competency prior to graduation. As necessary computer competency skills vary from discipline to discipline, each major determines the courses needed to satisfy this requirement. Undergraduate majors in Middle Eastern studies satisfy this requirement by earning a grade of “C–” or higher in CGS 2060, CGS 2100, or EME 2040. Minor in Middle Eastern Studies The Middle Eastern studies minor is concerned with the cultures of the Middle East from ancient times to the present. Utilizing the resources of a number of departments and programs, it allows the student to study the region from an interdisciplinary perspective. The minor can provide a Middle East focus for work in another discipline, can build a foundation necessary for advanced degrees in Middle Eastern studies, and can enable those planning to work in the region to gain a fuller understanding of its cultures. Requirements for a Minor in Middle Eastern Studies The minor will consist of fifteen semester hours and must include intermediate-level (2000 level) competence in Hebrew (biblical or modern), Arabic, or another Middle Eastern language approved by the committee. No more than eight semester hours of language courses may be counted toward the minor. No course taken for the minor may be used to fulfill any University language requirement. The remaining required hours must come either from the courses listed below or be approved by the coordinating committee. A minimum of seven to nine hours have to be taken at Florida State University.
