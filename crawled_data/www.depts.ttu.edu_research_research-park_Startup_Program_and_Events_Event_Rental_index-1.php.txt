The Hub is not intended to house academic departments, rather it is designed to facilitate the needs of small businesses and community members by offering leasable office, wet lab, and event space to the public at affordable pricing. The goal is to improve the possibility of connecting with business-minded individuals (bump-ability) who may not otherwise be encountered in the course of a normal day.
