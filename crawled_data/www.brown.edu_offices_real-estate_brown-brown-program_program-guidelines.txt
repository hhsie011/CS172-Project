Properties will be offered to new and current faculty and staff (see Eligibility) Premises will be used exclusively for single family residence and may not be rented or leased (except when employee is on Approved Leave of Absence) Sale price to the participant shall be determined by a market appraisal commissioned by the University.

After initial property improvements by Brown, pursuant to specifications of Brown's sole choosing, the property and structures are sold to the participant "as is". Prior to purchase, the participant should conduct a home inspection by a licensed inspector. Further, an inspection for existing environmental conditions (including but not limited to lead paint, radon, asbestos, UFFI) is recommended. Problems identified in these inspections that were not factored into the "as is" market appraisal can be addressed by the participant and the University prior to the sale. The University will provide to the participant all information in its possession concerning existing conditions and improvement specifications. Participants shall not have the option of performing the initial property improvements. Sale of all properties is subject to approval by the appropriate Brown Corporation bodies Upon sale, the participant and/or his/her agents shall hold the University harmless for any liability caused by existing environmental or structural conditions of the building or property Participant can make capital improvements (see additional information under Revised Repurchase %), defined as improvements requiring a City permit, to the property but must first obtain the written approval of the University and must abide by all building codes and permits restrictions To obtain approval for capital improvements (work requiring a building permit), the participant must submit to the University written, detailed plans and estimates for the proposed work.
