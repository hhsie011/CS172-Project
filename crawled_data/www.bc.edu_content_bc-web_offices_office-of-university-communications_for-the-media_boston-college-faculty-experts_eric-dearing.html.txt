Recognized as an esteemed leader in his field, Dearing’s work has been cited in testimony to Congress and appeared in the New York Times, U.S. News & World Report and USA Today and on NBC. Dearing’s research emphasizes the power of families, early education and care, and neighborhood supports to bolster achievement for children growing up in poverty. Much of his current work centers on promoting high-quality parent and early educator engagement to improve math learning for children in low-income families. Dearing also serves as a member of the Development and Research in Early Math Learning (DREME) network. His many publishing credits include co-editor of the Handbook of Early Childhood Programs, Practices, and Policies and co-author of the committee report Parenting Matters: Supporting Parents of Children 0–8, from the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine. He has been named a Foundation for Child Development Young Scholar awardee and a National Academy of Education/Spencer Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow. in the media The Hechinger Report Brookings Boston 25 News Back To Top Back To Top 140 Commonwealth Avenue Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 Accessibility Emergency Contact Notice of Nondiscrimination Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Boston College
