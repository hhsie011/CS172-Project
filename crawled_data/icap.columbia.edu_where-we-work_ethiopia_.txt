During Project Details From 2015 to 2018, ICAP provided technical support to implement, monitor, and sustain the delivery of high-quality adult and pediatric HIV prevention, care, and treatment in all regions of Ethiopia. During the project period, ICAP supported the development and enhancement of HIV-related national policies and guidelines. Regionally, the project worked to strengthen regional health bureau capacity to manage comprehensive HIV prevention, care and treatment program with local capacity. At the facility level, ICAP’s efforts enabled health care workers to deliver comprehensive and high-quality services to recipients of HIV care. The project was funded by the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), through the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Read the end-of-project report here MCAPDistricts (or national):National Project Details Columbia University’s role in implementing PEPFAR began in 2003, when it received funding from the Global AIDS Program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) under the University Project Details Columbia University’s role in implementing PEPFAR began in 2003, when it received funding from the Global AIDS Program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) under the University Technical Assistance Projects (UTAP) to support the development of important components of national HIV programs, including treatment protocols and training. In 2004, ICAP was founded and was awarded a new cooperative agreement from CDC under the PEPFAR framework, the Track 1.0 funding mechanism, to provide comprehensive HIV care and treatment in five countries: Kenya, Mozambique, Rwanda, South Africa, and Tanzania, with programming in Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, and Nigeria subsequently added. This initiative, the Multicountry Columbia Antiretroviral Program (MCAP), rapidly expanded programs for HIV care and ART by promoting early diagnosis of HIV infection, maintaining the health of those living with HIV, and preventing further transmission of HIV within the community. MCAP programming between 2004 and 2012, in addition to being focused on rapidly scaling up care and treatment in partnership with host-country governments, also emphasized the full continuum of HIV-related services, continued capacity building and health systems strengthening, and transition of operations to host governments and local nongovernmental organizations.

UTAP-2Districts (or national):National Project Details In September 2002, the Mailman School of Public Health (MSPH) at Columbia University (CU) entered into a Cooperative Agreement with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for the University Technical Project Details In September 2002, the Mailman School of Public Health (MSPH) at Columbia University (CU) entered into a Cooperative Agreement with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for the University Technical Assistance Projects (UTAP) in Support of the Global HIV/AIDS Program. Situated within ICAP, UTAP was originally envisioned as a single-country program for the provision of technical assistance, but rapidly grew to include long-term and short-term technical and administrative assistance to the national responses to HIV/AIDS in five countries: Mozambique, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zambia. As the original UTAP project drew to a close and PEPFAR moved into its second phase—focused on sustainability—ICAP entered into several, follow-on Cooperative Agreements, called UTAP-2. Four were country-focused (in Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Swaziland, and Tanzania) and the fifth—UTAP-2 Atlanta—became a flexible mechanism for providing a wide range of technical assistance and other support to PEPFAR countries. After beginning in 2009 as a means to help CDC conduct surveillance training more efficiently through distance education, UTAP-2 Atlanta grew over the next six and a half years to comprise 11 distinct projects addressing needs and gaps in the HIV response and answering important research questions to inform the response going forward.

Global Nurse Capacity Building Program (GNCBP), Nurse Education Partnership Initiative (NEPI), General Nursing (GN)Districts (or national):National Project Details The Global Nurse Capacity Building Program (GNCBP) was a multi-year program (2009-2018) to increase the quantity and quality of the nursing and midwifery workforce by addressing seven domains of health Project Details The Global Nurse Capacity Building Program (GNCBP) was a multi-year program (2009-2018) to increase the quantity and quality of the nursing and midwifery workforce by addressing seven domains of health workforce development: infrastructure, curriculum, faculty, clinical skills, production, in-service training, and partnership for policy and regulation. GNCBP was administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), under the U.S Department of Health and Human Services, with funding from the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The program used a holistic approach to strengthen nursing and midwifery education and practice through two complementary sub-projects: the Nursing Education Partnership Initiative (NEPI), which expanded the health workforce by producing new nurses and midwives, and the General Nursing (GN) project, which supported the maintenance of a skilled health workforce through continuing professional development in support of HIV care and treatment. In Ethiopia, NEPI enhanced nursing and midwifery education through infrastructure development, curriculum reform, faculty capacity building, and clinical training in partnership with MOH, Addis Ababa University School of Nursing, Arbaminch College of Health Sciences, and the University of Gondar Nursing School. Additionally, the GN promoted continued professional development for trained nurses in partnership with MOH, Ethiopia Nurses Association (ENA), and Ethiopia Midwives Association (EMwA) Find the GNCBP final report here Find out more about NEPI and General Nursing Read the GNCBP in Ethiopia report here ICAP in Ethiopia Program Start 2005 Key Technical Areas HIV prevention, care, and treatment HIV testing and counseling Human resources for health Laboratory systems strengthening Monitoring and evaluation Malaria Non-communicable diseases Nursing and midwifery Population-based surveys Prevention of mother-to child transmission of HIV Quality improvement Research Tuberculosis Current Funders Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation PEPFAR / Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Country Director Zenebe Melaku, MD Dr. Zenebe Melaku is ICAP’s country director in Ethiopia.
