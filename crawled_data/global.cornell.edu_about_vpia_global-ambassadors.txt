Connecting Cornell faculty with alumni and supporters worldwide. Mission Our Global Ambassadors are Cornell faculty who help to strengthen existing relationships, open doors for new connections, foster research and academic/professional opportunities, and enhance the university’s global impact. Activities Our faculty ambassadors represent Cornell University as they travel internationally for their work. They create meaningful connections worldwide and increase the visibility of Cornell’s global presence. They engage alumni and friends of the university by presenting lectures, attending alumni events, and meeting with small groups.
