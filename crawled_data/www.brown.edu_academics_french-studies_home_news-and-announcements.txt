Voici les trois contributions gagnantes: 1. Ciprian Buzila: Un rayon de soleil se faufile dans l’allée et m’invite en direction du château. Je suis en vacances, coupé du monde et je marche seul dans ce lieu où le temps se trouve suspendu. Été 2012. Château de Saint-Aignan-sur-Cher, France. 2. Christine Collins: « Qu'est-ce que c'est qu'un parapluie ? Est-ce ce qu'il vous protège de la pluie ? À Arles, c'est quelque chose d'autre. On ne connaît pas exactement son utilité, mais ça, c'est la beauté. » 3. Kate Talerico: Pour moi, je ne peux pas imaginer une photo plus française. Le béret, la cigarette pendouillant de la bouche, la chemise rayée en noir et blanc, l'écharpe, les marrons chauds, la crème de marron et noisette — tout ensemble, c'est une image complètement stéréotypée de la France. Cette photo a été prise à Chambéry, une petite ville de 60 000 habitants à côté des Alpes, pendant un marché de Noël. Chaque ville en France a son propre marché de Noël, et chacun offre de la nourriture typique de la France, comme des marrons, des crêpes avec du Nutella, et des gaufres. ___________________________________________________ Congratulations to Valentine Balguerie (PhD 2015) on her appointment as Assistant Professor at Randolph-Macon College.
