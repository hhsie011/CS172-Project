Those seeking external funds (e.g., National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, NASA) must ordinarily apply through OSP. The office also offers administrative support during the progress and close-out of sponsored project activities working closely with the academic departments and centers. All documents which require the signature of an Authorized University Official must be signed by one of the OSP Directors. You can follow sponsored funding news by reading the OSP/OVPR monthly newsletter.
