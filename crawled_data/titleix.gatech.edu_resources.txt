Title IX/Sexual Misconduct at Georgia Tech At Georgia Tech, we want everyone to achieve their potential and this means sustaining an environment where there is equal opportunity for excellence. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is a federal law designed to ensure women and men are provided equal access to programs and activities at educational institutions that receive federal financial assistance. Title IX encompasses more than athletics and federally funded research endeavors. It forbids sex discrimination in student services, academic programs and employment as well. Our policies and practices are the anchors in creating an inclusive campus culture. Every member of the Tech community – students, faculty, staff and administrators – is expected to comply with Title IX and to practice respectful, ethical and equitable treatment of others, regardless of their sex. Understanding Title IX and the rights it protects is critical to preventing any discriminatory behavior in violation of the law. You can learn more about Title IX compliance by visiting titleix.gatech.edu. Our collective success and the reputation of the Institute depend on how we treat each other as individuals. Sexual Discrimination, Harassment or Violence – Victim Rights: If you have been discriminated against, harassed or are the victim of sexual violence by a student, you are entitled to an investigation by the Title IX office, in addition to filing charges directly with the GT Police Department. Sexual misconduct investigations can be requested without filing charges with the GT Police Department. If the conduct was committed by an employee while on campus, you may contact the Office of Human Resources to pursue an investigation. General Overview of a Student Sexual Misconduct Investigation: An investigation typically begins with a claim or complaint. If the person making the report is not the victim, an attempt is made to speak with the victim, to determine if the victim wishes to pursue an investigation and whether an investigation is appropriate. During the meeting with the victim, information about the incident, including the name of the respondent (accused), is collected. Support services and interim measures are also discussed with the victim, to determine if immediate adjustments are needed. Examples of support services and/or interim measures include: No contact order, alternative housing arrangements (if a student lives on campus), alternative work location or hours, class/testing changes or reassignment of duties. An investigator is assigned and interviews are set up with potential witnesses, including the complainant/victim and respondent/accused. In appropriate cases, the Institute may retain the services of an outside investigator to conduct the investigation and interviews. The parties will be notified before an outside investigator contacts them. Based on what is discovered in the first round of interviews, next steps may vary. A second round of interviews may occur based on new information discovered in round one of the interviews. General Overview of a Student Sexual Misconduct Investigation (cont’d): Once the investigation is complete, the investigator will confer with the Title IX Coordinator regarding the investigation's findings. In some cases, the Institute's legal counsel may also provide input. Once the investigator's report is final, the respondent and claimant are notified of the findings. Following investigation, cases involving accused students are referred to the Office of Student Integrity for a hearing, if the matter is not otherwise resolved. A sexual misconduct hearing hanel, whose members are trained in the conduct of hearings and applicable policies and laws, will hear evidence, make a determination as to the respondent's responsibility and, if applicable, impose appropriate sanctions. The Office of Student Integrity may periodically follow up with the parties to address any ongoing concerns. If this handout does not answer questions you may have about the sexual misconduct investigation process, please contact the Office of the Title IX Coordinator at 404-385-5583. Under no circumstances will retaliation be tolerated. If retaliation should happen, you are encouraged to report it to the Office of the Title IX Coordinator immediately.
