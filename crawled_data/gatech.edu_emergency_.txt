The Georgia Tech Police Department (GTPD) Office of Emergency Preparedness is focused on helping the Institute reduce the effects of disasters through preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation activities. This office is responsible for implementing Georgia Tech’s Emergency Action Plan and for working with building managers to create comprehensive emergency plans for their particular locations. To assure that ongoing concerns are addressed, Georgia Tech has an active Emergency Preparedness Advisory Group that meets quarterly and includes representatives from key Institute departments as well as the Atlanta Police Department (APD), Atlanta Fire Department (AFD), and the Atlanta/Fulton County Emergency Management Agency (AFCEMA). Emergencies can range from annoyingly inconvenient to completely devastating. To prepare for crisis situations, Emergency Preparedness conducts vulnerability assessments across campus and continually reviews preparedness and response procedures to enhance safety. Plans are in place to address emergencies ranging from natural disasters to bomb threats. These plans are routinely exercised with local first responders including APD, AFD, and AFCEMA. When a significant campus emergency occurs, updates will be shared via the Georgia Tech homepage and the appropriate social media channels. The Georgia Tech Emergency Notification System (GTENS) will be utilized as appropriate. The Emergency Management office also oversees the following initiatives: Georgia Tech Emergency Notification System (GTENS) GTENS Sign-up Weather Alert Sign-up GT Ready (Continuity of Operations Planning) LiveSafe app (GT Police Department) Social Media Channels Georgia Tech Twitter Facebook Emergency Management & Communications Twitter Facebook Campus Procedures for Hazardous Weather Weather or other emergency situations may make it necessary for Georgia Tech to declare either "classes cancelled" or "campus closed" conditions.
