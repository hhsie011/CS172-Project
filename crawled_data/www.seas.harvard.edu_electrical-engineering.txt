Electrical Engineers invent devices for sensing and actuation; they design physical substrates for computation; they create algorithms for analysis and control; and they expand the theory of information processing. Their practice is based in fundamental science and mathematics, and this creates opportunities for both theoretical and experimental research. Electrical engineers at Harvard are pursuing work on diamond nanofabrication; quantum devices; integrated circuits for cellular biotechnology; millimeter-scale robots; hardware for machine learning; the optimization of smart power grids and other networked systems; disentangling brain signals and mapping brain circuits; distilling information from large stochastic datasets; and the fundamental limits of private information sharing.
