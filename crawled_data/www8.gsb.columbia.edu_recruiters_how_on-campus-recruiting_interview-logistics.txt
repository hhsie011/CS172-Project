Why Recruit Columbia Talent? Employment Reports Contact Us After you have identified the students you wish to interview, please submit your invite list through COIN, the School's online career management system. You may also send invitations directly to the students if you wish, but this is not required, as students are notified of invitations from employers through COIN. They must then follow Career Management Center procedures to accept invitations and obtain an interview time slot. The CMC uses COIN functionality to automatically schedule students' interview times. Invitation lists must be received on time so that we have enough time to process your schedule(s). If we do not receive your invitation list by the deadline, we reserve the right to reschedule your interview day or ask you to manage your own schedules. Full-Time Recruiting Invitation lists are due through COIN exactly two weeks (14 calendar days) before the interview date unless otherwise specified by the Career Management Center. Internship Recruiting Invitation lists are due through COIN exactly two weeks (14 calendar days) before the interview date except for those companies interviewing from January 4-13. Your account manager will advise you of your specific date. Alternate Invitations Firms are encouraged to invite alternate candidates to ensure that the interview schedules remain full. Final Schedules Although you may access and print your schedules from COIN at any time, please note that they will not be finalized until 9 am two business days before the interview. Prior to that point, students will be able to change their times or drop the interview, so please do not print or distribute schedules to interviewers before then.
