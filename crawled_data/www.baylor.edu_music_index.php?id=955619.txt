The Baylor Percussion Group is the percussion department's primary performance ensemble and annually presents concerts of the most significant percussion works of the 20th and 21st centuries. A central focus of the group is to foster relationships between composers and performers through collaborations and commissions. Each year the BPG works with some of the most innovative artists in contemporary music at the Baylor Percussion Symposium. To date, the group has worked with Pulitzer Prize winning composers Steve Reich and David Lang, as well as percussion superstars Glenn Kotche, Steven Schick, So Percussion, and Doug Perkins. The BPG has performed at the Make Music New York Festival, Fast Forward Austin, the Menil Collection, the Round Top International Festival-Institute, the Waco Cultural Arts Festival, and the Texas Music Educators Association Convention.

These ensembles combine a stimulating learning environment with a high level of artistic achievement and regularly present concerts at venues throughout the country and abroad. The Baylor Jazz Program, under the direction of Alex Parker, allows percussionists to gain invaluable drum set experience in the Jazz Ensemble, Concert Jazz Ensemble, and jazz combos. The Jazz Program regularly welcomes today's top jazz artists to campus for collaborative performances with our students. Students are also encouraged to participate on the Baylor Drumline. The BDL consists of approximately 32 percussionists who come from all facets of university life. The BDL strives to create an educational environment that is conducive to a high level of performance, while upholding the rich traditions of the Baylor University Golden Wave Band.
