The complexities of metabolic diseases require an equally multidisciplinary attack that goes beyond simply translating basic science discoveries into clinical practice. The mission of the CGCH is to advance cardiometabolic health through collaboration, research, teaching and mentoring engagement and strong networks among leading institutions globally. It aims to create a portfolio of activities that cross the domains of research and international engagement. The CCGH is a research and teaching program that strives to bring the best public health sciences to bear on the emerging challenges of 1) assessing the impact of genes and their interactions with behavior, nutrition, and the environment on health and diseases; 2) critically and systematically evaluating the significance of genetic and dietary variations within populations and applying that knowledge to improve public's health. It aims to conducts research activities in several main areas: (1) sample processing, genotyping and molecular epidemiology ("wetlab"), (2) nutritional epidemiology, dietary assessment core, and statistical and bioinformatic analysis ("drylab"). (3) small-scale functional and intervention studies The CCGH is guided by participating faculty across Brown and its affiliated institutions. Training Program is open to all graduate students (MPH, PhD, MD) who seek to apply advanced genomic, molecular, epidemiological, laboratory and quantitative methods to the study of disease distribution in human populations. Acceptance into this program will provide trainees in this area of research with the foundational quantitative and laboratory knowledge to enable important interdisciplinary research in metabolic diseases. In short, this training program is a set of interdisciplinary and integrative research initiatives that allow trainees to leverage a rich array of resources. We collaborate with colleagues in the Departments of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, Medicine, and other departments at Brown University and elsewhere. We have had research, teaching, and service activities in six of the seven Continents: The training program also include seminar series, field training (clinical, laboratory, and a strong emphasis on field placements in affiliated institutions globally), research experience using large datasets and advanced analytical tools, one-on-one assigned mentoring as well as peer-to-peer mentoring. Our trainees are hold to the standards of the early career stage scientists with support and encouragement for publication submissions, grant submissions, conference presentation, and ultimately research placements. Efforts are grown out of the critical need to prioritize resources for the development of public health programs related to disease burden as well as our belief that unprecedented reduction in diseases can be produced through collaborative thinking and innovations. With a team of outstanding researchers and educators at the cutting edge of their research, the program harnesses major advances in biomedical and population sciences to focus on integration. Since the program provides training in laboratory and population sciences to integrate the entire continuum from "sick" molecules to "sick" populations. By providing foundational training and research experience from both ends of the spectrum, trainees are prepared for integrating population-based quantitative sciences with laboratory based biological sciences to effectively lead the cross-disciplinary studies of the future. ****************************************************************************************************************************** The Laboratory of Molecular Epidemiology and Nutrition at Brown University directed by Professor Simin Liu, focuses its research and teaching in several thematic areas of clinical and public health importance. The first is in the investigation of genetic, nutritional, and environmental influences and their interactions as potential determinants for health and disease outcomes in diverse human populations. The second related area is in the critical and systematic assessment of relative mediating effects of these potential determinants for cardiometabolic disorders and their distributions in diverse populations. The third area is to apply the knowledge gained through work in the first two areas to improve understanding of health and diseases for both individuals and across populations.We collaborate with colleagues in the Departments of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, Medicine, and other departments at Brown University and elsewhere. Our laboratory conducts research mainly in the United States and China, though we have had research, teaching, and service activities in six of the seven Continents: (1) Molecular epidemiology (utilizing blood, DNA, urine samples to identify biomarkers for improved understanding of gene-nutrition interactions in cardometabolic disorders and the early detection, prognostic and therapeutic strategies against these outcomes ("wetlab"). (2) Nutritional epidemiology, dietary assessment, and statistical and bioinformatic analysis ("drylab"). (3) Functional and intervention studies in selected patients or participants.
