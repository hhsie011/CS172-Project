We provide a rich environment in which our doctoral candidates can pursue their professional study and broaden their interests in mathematical learning. Faculty members are quite accessible, resulting in a great deal of out-of-class interaction between faculty and graduate students. Areas in which students have recently chosen to specialize for their dissertation research include algebra, analysis, topology, applied mathematics (e.g., cryptology, numerical analysis, signal processing), mathematical biology, combinatorics, geometry, logic, number theory, and set theory.
