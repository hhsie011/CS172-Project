Take these tips into consideration while you explore your options! Consider Which Type of Program Interests You: Would you like to go for a semester, year, or summer? A semester or year program offers the opportunity for a more immersive experience than you may get on a short-term program. There are both, group semester programs and independent semester programs, students can choose from. How about an internship? You can take courses and take a for-credit internship in your country of study. Baylor works with partners who connect students with internship opportunities in their area of interest and study for either a summer or semester to earn 3-6 credits. Our Baylor students have interned in the UK, Chile, Australia, and Czech Republic (to name a few!) Academic Interests Consider: Which courses you need to graduate and which ones you can take while abroad. Work with your academic advisor to come up with a list of courses you can take abroad to stay on track. Then bring that list to your study abroad advisor to help determine which programs make the most sense for you! Personal Interests Ask Yourself: What do I want to get out of studying abroad? Do I want to learn a language? Do I want to be able to easily travel to many different places? Do I want to be in a big city or a smaller city/town? Do I want to experience what it is like to attend a large university in another country? What level of support/independence do I want while abroad? Do I want to go abroad with only other Baylor students? Do I want to go abroad with a Baylor faculty member? Do I want to take courses directly enrolled at a local University? Consider: What do you want out of this experience, not your classmates or others? Talk to other students who have gone abroad to make an informed choice. Choose the program that best fits your personality and interests. Professional Goals Ask Yourself: What skillset am I looking to gain by studying abroad? Should I do an internship while being abroad? What other clubs or orgs do I want to look into abroad? Consider: Studying abroad is a good time to build your networks. Networking with new people on your program, at your host institution, and that you meet during your time abroad can help you to build a network of contacts as you move into your future career. Some of our semester-long programs offer an academic internship option. Completing an internship while abroad is a great way to gain professional experience in a global society. Start thinking about the soft skills you develop while studying abroad and how you can hone those in your program. Soft skills include things like intercultural communication, adaptability, and problem-solving. Window shop Explore Programs. Search by discipline, term, or location, and get excited!
