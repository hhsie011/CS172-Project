Every effort is made to keep these guides up to date, but curriculum is always evolving. The OSU Catalog provides the most up to date requirements. Students transferring to OSU will be required to complete the degree requirements outlined in the catalog for the year they matriculate. For example, students entering OSU in fall 2021 will be required to complete the curriculum in the 2021-2022 catalog, regardless of changes made to the curriculum in subsequent years. Transfer credit at OSU - includes community college articulations, a single-course search tool, and information about credit awarded for AP/IB, CLEP, Military experience, etc. General articulation information for Oregon community colleges is available online, but may not reflect specific courses in College of Forestry majors. OSU's Baccalaureate Core Equivalencies outline transferrable courses from two-year colleges in Oregon and Hawaii. The Transfer Course Search can help determine how credits from institutions outside of Oregon will transfer to OSU. Again, many courses in the College of Forestry majors may not be reflected in this tool. Questions about articulations can be directed to: Nicole Kent, Manager of Advising & Academic Relations 541-737-1592 nicole.kent@oregonstate.edu Oregon Transfer Forms Blue Mountain Community College Forest-Civil Engineering Forest Engineering Forestry - Management Option Forestry - Operations Management Option Forestry - Restoration & Fire Option Renewable Materials - Art & Design Option Renewable Materials - Management & Marketing Option Renewable Materials - Science & Engineering Option Tourism, Recreation & Adventure Leadership - Adven.
