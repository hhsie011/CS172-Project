Bioengineering The Princeton Bioengineering Initiative aims to build synergy with a broad cross section of Princeton’s research activities in the life sciences and engineering, including biomolecular, cellular and tissue engineering for human health, biomedical device development and other technologies that interface with biological systems, and data science approaches in biology and medicine. Investigate the Initiative “There is no question that we are at a turning point in terms of the ability to harness biological systems for the good of humanity.” — Cliff Brangwynne, inaugural director of the Princeton Bioengineering Initiative Faculty Cliff Brangwynne seeks the symphony in the science of cells Cliff Brangwynne’s research has provided a foundation for an entire new field of study and uncovered promising clues for potential treatments for cancer and neurodegenerative diseases like ALS, Alzheimer’s disease, and Huntington’s disease. Meet Cliff Bioengineering Because of Princeton’s interdisciplinary strengths and thriving internal and external partnerships, bioengineering at the University is at an inflection point for growth and service to humanity.
