During the Give Light Campaign, Robbins College will focus their fundraising efforts in the following areas: Endowed scholarships to meet the needs of students and remove barriers to their Baylor education. Endowed faculty positions and programmatic support to broaden and deepen academic opportunities and community outreach. Missional and research opportunities to provide their students with a global perspective. The following are the Robbins College’s highest priority fundraising projects that are being highlighted in the current phase of the Give Light Campaign. The College will bring forward other opportunities for the Baylor Family to support the talented students and faculty within the Robbins College of Health and Human Sciences. Endowed Scholarships: $5 million With the third-largest undergraduate enrollment among Baylor’s academic units, the Robbins College is vibrant and growing. Priority Area: Public Health The College has identified its newest department, Public Health, as a priority area for increasing scholarship endowment. Public Health’s endowment and scholarship funding currently fall behind the support of Robbins College’s other departments, due to its relatively young age. Student interest is high, and in order to ensure that all students can participate in the Public Health program Robbins College must increase its endowment to meet the scholarship needs of its talented students. Faculty and Programmatic Endowment Robbins College has identified increasing its endowment as a fundamental step toward reaching Baylor’s goal to become a tier-one Christian research university. Enhancing endowment and programmatic resources furthers these aspirations, providing faculty with the resources needed to teach and train students for their callings in life, while also providing vital resources to the Central Texas Community. Faculty Endowment: $10 million The endowing of faculty positions dynamically serves the mission of the College by providing resources for faculty research while also creating an attractive recruiting tool for scholars at the top of their fields. Named, endowed positions are an attractive and prestigious opportunity for faculty, and such positions will assist Robbins College as it looks to recruit faculty leaders for its departments. Camp Success: $2 million Since 2003, Robbins College of Health and Human Science’s Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders (CSD) has provided a rich source of training for its students, as well as life-changing access to intensive language and literacy-related therapy for Central Texas families each summer through a program called Camp Success. The College is seeking permanent funding support for graduate-level scholarships and staffing support will expand the number of Baylor students taught through the program, as well as the number of children and families who can benefit from therapy. Communication Sciences and Disorders Autism Resource Clinic: $7 million Robbins College is calling upon the Baylor Family to help meet the needs of its program and the needs of its patients through the creation of a separate, new clinic: the Autism Resource Clinic. The Communication Sciences and Disorders (CSD) faculty and staff have identified the need for the Autism Resource Clinic where graduate students can be trained more effectively in best practices for their clients with autism. Missional and Research Opportunities Abroad: $3 million Robbins College has identified as a priority expanding its endowment to fund study abroad opportunities, as well as discipline-specific missions, helping students connect their studies and skills to real-world applications, showing students how to be the hands and feet of Christ. Whether through medical missions or study abroad, Robbins College’s impact on our world can be greatly enhanced through additional endowment funding for such important, transformational opportunities for our students. Camp Success Camp Success and other services provided through the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders in its state-of-the-art clinical facilities allow students to apply classroom knowledge to real-world endeavors that meet community needs.
