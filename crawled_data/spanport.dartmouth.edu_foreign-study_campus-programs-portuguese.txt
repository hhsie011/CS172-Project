PreviousNext LOCATION The LSA+ and FSP are based in São Paulo, capital of the homonymous state of São Paulo. Cosmopolitan and vibrant, São Paulo is the largest city in Brazil. It is a hub of business, culture, sports and the arts that appeals to a wide range of tastes and interests. Founded in 1554, São Paulo matured into a culturally diverse city, powerful economically and politically. It was one of the first cities to benefit from the coffee boom in the late 19th century. Soon after, it became the foremost industrial center in Latin America, attracting major waves of domestic migrants and foreign immigrants, particularly Italians, Germans, Japanese, Lebanese, Syrians, Greeks, Chinese and Koreans. Home to top institutions of higher education, São Paulo has a large and diverse population of university students and is Brazil's main center for academic research and professional development. Classes are taught at the CIEE center and at the Pontifícia Universidade Católica de São Paulo - PUC-SP.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Spanish and Portuguese Undergraduate Overview Frequently Asked Questions Advisors Student Awards and Prizes Programs Hispanic Studies Romance Studies Lusophone Studies Hispanic and Lusophone Studies Honors Thesis Program Thesis Timeline Application Process Thesis Research Funding Past Theses Courses Spanish Portuguese First-Year Seminars (FYS) Placement Information Spanish Portuguese Transfer Credits Alumni Update Foreign Study Overview Programs in Spanish Spanish LSA in Barcelona and Buenos Aires (NEW) Spanish LSA in Santander (NEW) Spanish LSA+ in Barcelona [NEW] Spanish LSA+ in Buenos Aires Spanish FSP in Madrid and Buenos Aires Programs in Portuguese Portuguese LSA+ in São Paulo, Brazil Student Opportunities Overview Apprentice Teacher Information Digital Resources Student Funding AT/Drill Instructor Tryout Dates La Casa Overview Apply Living Guidelines Who We Are Frequently Asked Questions Day of the Dead El Cafecito News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
