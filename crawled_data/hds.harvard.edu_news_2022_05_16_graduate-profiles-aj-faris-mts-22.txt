How I've Changed I've gotten to know a lot of really incredible people and learned a lot about my own perspective and methodologies of religious studies scholarship. Memorable Moment I think my first day in-person in September was so wonderful after having been remote for a year, and getting to see people I'd only previously talked to through a screen face-to-face and walk around with them or grab coffee was a real pleasure. Favorite Class or Professor Exploring the Quran with Professor Goudarzi and teaching fellow Javad Hashmi made for a wonderful class in both content and community. I feel like we had an amazing time learning from both of them and from one another. The class was a genuine joy. Message of Thanks I would like to thank Professor Feldman from NELC and Ethan Levin and Carolyn Beard for being my harbor throughout the last year. Yiddish always felt like a home to me and it's because of y'all. What I Hope to Be Remembered By I hope that I will be remembered for putting my heart into my scholarship and my work and for having a genuine love for knowledge and community. Future Plans I'll be moving back to California to spend time with family and will be taking a break from school to figure out what I want to do next.
