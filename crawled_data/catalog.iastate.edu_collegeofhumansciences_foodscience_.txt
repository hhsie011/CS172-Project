Food scientists apply basic science (chemistry, biology, physics) to improve processing, preservation, and safety of food and to develop new food products. The food science major is approved by the Institute of Food Technologists. Student Learning Outcomes Upon graduation, students should be able to: Communicate effectively in their field of study using written, oral, visual and/or electronic forms. Demonstrate proficiency in ethical data collection and interpretation, literature review and citation, critical thinking and problem solving. Facilitate and participate effectively in a group, team, or organization. Plan life-long learning activities with the aim of improving professional skills. Integrate creativity, innovation, or entrepreneurship in ways that produce value. Describe sociocultural competence relative to diversity, equity and/or inclusion. Explain how human activities impact the natural environment and how societies are affected. Meet program specific learning outcomes for the Food Science major. The department also offers a food science minor. Administered by the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition Courses listed below are required. Total Degree Requirement: 120 cr.
