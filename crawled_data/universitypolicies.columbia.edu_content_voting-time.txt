Specifically, if an employee has four consecutive hours either between the opening of the polls and the beginning of their work shift, or between the end of their working shift and the closing of the polls, the employee is deemed to have sufficient time outside of working hours within which to vote. (For example, if an employee’s workday ends at 5 p.m. and polls are open until 9 p.m.). The employee must advise their supervisor at least two business days in advance of the time off needed for voting. The supervisor may designate whether the requested time be taken at the beginning or the end of shift.
