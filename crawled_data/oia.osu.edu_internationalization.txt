To enhance the university’s rich history of global engagement and build upon the university’s international successes, Ohio State launched an international strategic planning process in mid-April 2019 that resulted in an ‘International Strategic Plan 2020-2025’ that was presented to the President and Provost for approval on June 30, 2020. The steering committee was composed of senior academic and operational leaders, including representation from the colleges, regional campuses and administrative units, to ensure that the International Strategic Plan is academically aligned and operationally sound. The plan will clearly articulate the academic priority for internationalization and the implications for the operations side of the university. Gil Latz, vice provost for global strategies and international affairs, and Randy Smith, vice provost for academic programs, co-chaired the steering committee. The steering committee was assisted in its work by Ohio State’s Chief Strategy Officer, Gail Marsh, and Robin Helms, an external expert on campus internationalization from the American Council on Education, both of whom provided consultation and guidance. The strategic planning process consisted of engaging and listening to stakeholders, synthesizing and analyzing information and documenting and prioritizing recommendations. ﻿ 140 Enarson Classroom Building 2009 Millikin Rd Columbus, OH 43210 614-292-6101 | oia.osu.edu © 2022 The Ohio State University About Us Directory Vice Provost Publications Sitemap Privacy Statement Cookies Settings Accessibility Feedback Non-Discrimination Notice Request an alternate format of this page
