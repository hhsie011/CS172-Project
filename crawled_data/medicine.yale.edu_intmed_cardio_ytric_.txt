The facility centralizes small and large animal housing and surgery with state-of-the-art imaging resources. The core resources include; an integrated surgical and fluoroscopy suite, radiochemistry laboratory, a unique hybrid SPECT/64-slice CT scanner, a microSPECT/CT imaging suite, in vitro and in vivo microCT scanners, 3D ultrasound imaging systems, a state-of-the-art mouse echo core laboratory, and 3D graphics workstations. The center focuses on imaging probe and technology development and multimodality anatomic, physiological, and molecular imaging, and image registration and quantification. The training in the Center is supported by an NHLBI-funded T32 program in multimodality molecular and translational cardiovascular imaging. Y-TRIC staff also facilitate multimodality animal imaging at the Yale Magnetic Resonance Research Center (MRRC) and Yale PET Center.
