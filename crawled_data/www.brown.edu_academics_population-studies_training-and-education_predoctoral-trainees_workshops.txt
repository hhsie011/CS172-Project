In addition to mentoring from PSTC faculty associates, selected coursework, and administrative and funding support, the Center offers wide exposure to the field and leading scholars via colloquia and special speaker series, working groups, workshops, and professionalization opportunities. All new PSTC trainees are expected to attend a proseminar, which is scheduled from 2:30-3:30 pm on Thursdays. Visit the PSTC's Events page for details about upcoming activities at the Center. The post-colloquia meetings with speakers have been the most valuable part of my PSTC trainee experience so far. In some cases, they are great networking opportunities, and in others, they are simply a unique chance to sit down with someone to collect personal and professional advice. In one case, my meeting with a speaker led to co-authoring a paper together! Had I not attended the grad student meeting after her presentation, I could have never made such a valuable connection. - Kira DiClemente, PSTC Predoctoral Trainee in Public Health Back to top Explore Brown University Search Brown Show/Hide Learn More About Brown Academics Admission Research Campus Life Find A to Z Index People Directory Information for Students Faculty Staff Families Alumni Friends & Neighbors Top Destinations Global Brown Watson Institute Graduate School Alpert Medical School School of Public Health School of Engineering Population Studies and Training Center Population Studies and Training Center Brown University Box 1836 68 Waterman St. Providence, RI 02912 Phone: 401-863-2668 Email [email protected] Giving to Brown Brown University Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA Phone: 401-863-1000 Maps & Directions / Contact Us Â© 2022 Brown University Connect: [email protected] Facebook Twitter YouTube Instagram iTunes U Google+ LinkedIn SnapChat
