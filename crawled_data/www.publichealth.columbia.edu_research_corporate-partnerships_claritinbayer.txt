Otsuka Pharmaceuticals Novo Nordisk Merck: Savings Mothers, Giving Life Claritin/Bayer Hospital Decision-Making Simulation Otsuka Pharmaceuticals Novo Nordisk Merck: Savings Mothers, Giving Life Claritin/Bayer Hospital Decision-Making Simulation Claritin/Bayer Bayer and its allergy medication Claritin were launching a public awareness campaign to encourage Americans to spend more time outdoors. Using an existing and publicly available data set, the American Time Use Survey, researchers at Columbia Mailman School generated independently validated data points to support the campaign. The data revealed that Americans spend, on average, 95% of their time indoors. Additional data showed that Americans four times as much time watching TV as they spend outdoors, and that spending just 30 additional minutes outdoors each day could lead to significant health returns. Claritin utilized these findings as the underpinning of its successful public education campaign.
