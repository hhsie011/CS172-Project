Definitions of Diversity The Office for Institutional Diversity proposes the following definitions for the terms diversity and inclusion: Diversity refers to the range of human differences that includes the primary or internal dimension such as age, gender, race, ethnicity, physical and mental ability and sexual orientation; and the secondary or external dimension such as thought styles, religion, nationality, socio-economic status, belief systems, military experience and education. Inclusion involves the active, intentional, and ongoing engagement of our diversity, where each person is valued, respected and supported for his or her distinctive skills, experiences and perspectives, to create a working and learning environment where everyone has an opportunity to experience personal fulfillment and participate fully in creating a successful and thriving Boston College. It is a means of creating value from the differences of all members of our community, in order to leverage talent and foster both individual and organizational excellence. “When individuals are not recognized, or don’t feel at home, or are unable to contribute as they might, we all suffer, we’re all weakened. We’re not as strong as we could be.” William P.
