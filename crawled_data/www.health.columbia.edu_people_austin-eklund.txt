Before joining Counseling and Psychological Services, he completed a pre-doctoral internship at the James J. Peters Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) in the Bronx. Over the course of his career as a therapist, he has worked in three college counseling settings, two community care settings, two psychiatric hospitals, and a shelter for people experiencing housing insecurity and co-occurring mental illness. Reflecting his longstanding research work at the nexus of applied psychology and public health, his dissertation focused on factors predicting uptake of sexual health promotion information among queer men of color. In addition to extensive experience treating anxiety and depression, he has specialized training in evidence-based practices for trauma- and stressor-related disorders, substance misuse, emotion dysregulation, and intimate relationship distress. As a person with intersecting marginalized identities, he is passionate about working with members of communities representing a broad diversity spectrum and seeks to approach therapeutic work through multicultural and feminist lenses. He aims to work collaboratively with patients to develop flexible treatment plans and integrates techniques from a variety of psychotherapy theories.
