THE STONE CENTER The Roger Thayer Stone Center for Latin American Studies A comprehensive program with faculty in almost every region and discipline essential to understanding Latin America The Stone Center administers interdisciplinary B.A., M.A, and Ph.D. programs in which students may put together curricular selected from several departments or professional schools. Many students have found that such a program gives them flexibility and better access to the full resources of the university than can be had within the confines of a single department. The Center hosts a wide range of conferences, symposia, film series, and other activities. It also coordinates a number of the university's many research and study programs in Latin America.
