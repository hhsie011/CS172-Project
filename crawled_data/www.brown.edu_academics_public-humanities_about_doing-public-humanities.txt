Carter Brown Architecture Lectures Performances Workshops Blog Doing Public Humanities We are pleased to announce the July 2020 publication of Doing Public Humanities, edited by the Center for Public Humanities' former Director, Professor of American Studies Susan Smulyan. The book’s essays, written by faculty, staff and alumni of the Center, are essential reading for students, faculty and practitioners in public history, historic preservation, the history of art, engaged sociology and public archaeology and anthropology. The contributors are committed to presenting a Public Humanities practice that encourages social justice and explores the intersectionalities of race, class, gender, and sexualities. Together, they illustrate the theories and methods of the Public Humanities, and the field’s unique synthesis of critical thinking, creative practice, social justice work, and community engagement and allyship. Doing Public Humanities can be purchased on the Routledge website or at local or online bookstores. All of the contributors are available for classroom visits or guest lectures related to these essays.
