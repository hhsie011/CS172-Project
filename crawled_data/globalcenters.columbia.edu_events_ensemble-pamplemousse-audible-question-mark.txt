Can we slow down the world enough to achieve understanding? How close is too close to the same thing? Composer/performer collective Ensemble Pamplemousse presents a program of 6 new works embodying these questions and others through diverse re-mappings of musical and visual material. Each piece is made from a specialized interest— ranging from micro-detailed improvisational writing to the netherworld of videoreality to electro-mechanical musical robotics. The show combines weirdness and beauty with pop culture and classical virtuosity. Composed and Performed by: David Broome Natacha Diels Andrew Greenwald Bryan Jacobs Jessie Marino Weston Olencki Ensemble Biography: Composer/performer collective Ensemble Pamplemousse was founded in 2003 to provide a focal point for like-minded creators with a thirst for sonic exploration. The ensemble is a close-knit group of divergent artistic personalities, emergent from training in disparate musical fields. Their collective love for the exquisite in all sonic realms leads the ensemble to persistently discover new vistas of sound at the frayed edges of dissective instrumental performance technique. Compositions aggregate each member's unique virtuosic talents into extraordinary magical moments. In the flexible moments of performance, the ensemble weaves together shapes of resonance, clusters of glitch, skitters of hyper action, and masses of absurdity into impeccable structures of unified beauty. This concert is part of The Nature of Sound: Mini-Festival. The Nature of Sound is a series exploring the diverse sound worlds of contemporary music. The three concerts present American composer-performers renowned for their inventive and virtuosic artistic practices in electronic and acoustic composition, sound art, and improvisation. Cosponsors: The Reiner Center for Contemporary Music, Columbia University; Columbia Global Centers | Paris; Department of Music, Columbia University; Columbia University Club of France; Columbia Undergraduate Programs in Paris.
