Supervisors who wish to hire only FWS eligible students should create Federal Work-Study jobs in JobX. FWS-eligible students can be hired into FWS-only jobs, or standard undergraduate positions. In either case, FWS student wages will be paid from the University's central FWS account during the 2021-22 academic year. As a reminder, all student jobs (including FWS positions) must be registered in the JobX portal. The Federal Work-Study Award Year The 2021-22 Federal Work-Study Award Year is as follows: Beginning of FWS Year: August 23, 2021 End of FWS Year: May 15, 2022 Hiring Tips and Award Limits Federal Work-Study students are limited to earning the amount reflected in their financial aid award. TimesheetX will alert students and supervisors who approach their earnings limit and the Student Employment Office will work with students to increase the FWS award when possible. If a student fully expends their FWS award and our office is unable to increase it, we will notify both the student and employing department. The department must then decide whether to rehire the student (paying them from departmental funds), or to terminate the position. If you have questions about a student’s Work-Study eligibility, please reach out to the Student Employment team via phone or email.
