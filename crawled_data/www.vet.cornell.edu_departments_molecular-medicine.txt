Research Areas The over-arching theme of the research being conducted in Molecular Medicine is to obtain basic understandings of protein structure and function, protein-protein, and protein-membrane interactions as they pertain to fundamental processes in cell and developmental biology. The research efforts of the department faculty encompass cancer cell signaling and metabolism, structural determinations of membrane proteins and signaling systems, the molecular basis by which cells and their organelles respond to extracellular stimuli and stress, and signaling events that underlie neuronal transmission and function.
