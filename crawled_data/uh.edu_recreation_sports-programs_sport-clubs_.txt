Sport Clubs are officially sponsored by the Department of Campus Recreation. The Sport Clubs Program is an integral part of the Department of Campus Recreation. It fills the void between Intramural Sports and Intercollegiate Athletics. Sport Clubs give the university community an opportunity to participate in competitive sports activities, learn new skills, improve skill levels, and enjoy the recreational and social fellowship derived from sports involvement. Every student is given the opportunity to try out for, and be part of any club; however, if a student joins a club sports team, playing time is not guaranteed. Membership in a club is free from discrimination based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, ethnic group, disability or national origin.
