The Dartmouth College Academic Honor Principle The German placement exam is to be completed in accordance with the Dartmouth College Academic Honor Principle. Every student who applies to and is accepted by Dartmouth College has agreed to abide by the provisions of the Honor Principle as long as he or she remains a student at the College. Please note the following provision of the Honor Principle: Any student giving or receiving assistance during an examination or quiz violates the Academic Honor Principle. Students are therefore expected to take the German placement exam on their own, without help from others or from a reference source, and to do so to the best of their ability.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of German Studies Undergraduate Overview Why Study German?
