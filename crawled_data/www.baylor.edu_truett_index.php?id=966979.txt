Inspired by Esther 4:14, the 2021 conference theme—"For Such a Time as This"—involves an exploration of topics and questions that are particularly significant during these days. All events are free.

Webinar with Mariah Humphries: Be the Bridge: Racial Reconciliation within the Church March 19, 2021 | 11:00am Mariah Humphries is a Mvskoke Nation citizen, writer, and educator for Be the Bridge. Through her experience navigating the tension between Native and White American culture, she brings Native awareness to non-Native spaces. With over 20 years of vocational ministry service, she is focused on theology, racial literacy and reconciliation within the American Church. Through her work with Be the Bridge, Mariah is part of a team of administrators for over 73,000 members. She is the primary educator for the Be the Bridge Ministry group where she works with over 1,500 vocational pastors and church leaders. She is a curriculum writer for Be the Bridge materials and she represents a Native American voice as a general educator. Mariah received her MTS from Truett Seminary.

Webinar with Dr. Rebecca Poe Hays: A Balanced Life in an Upside-Down World April 9, 2021 | 11:00am Dr. Rebecca Poe Hays serves as Assistant Professor of Christian Scriptures at Baylor University's Truett Seminary. Before joining the faculty at Truett, she worked with Baylor’s Institute for Faith and Learning on a grant from the Lilly Endowment’s Called to Lives of Meaning and Purpose Initiative that focused on the exploration of vocation in churches. Dr. Poe Hays believes that ministry must be grounded in faithful and responsible readings of Scripture, and she loves teaching the “Older” Testament in order to draw out its ongoing relevance for the church. She is particularly interested in how stories emerge from the Psalms and shape our engagement with these song-prayers, and in how these literary features might help individuals and faith communities cope with trauma and develop resilience. She presents regularly at the national meetings of the Society for Biblical Literature and is co-chair of the Old Testament/Hebrew Bible unit of the regional SBL. An ordained deacon, she has served in churches and Christian non-profits in Tennessee, Alabama, and Texas. Dr. Poe Hays and her husband Joshua, who serves as Associate Pastor at the First Baptist Church of Waco, have a daughter named Mary Brandon and a distinguished mutt named Cooper.
