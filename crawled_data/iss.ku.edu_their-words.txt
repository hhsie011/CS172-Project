I have made wonderful friendships within my department and outside of it and I have been guided by and learned from leading experts in the field of special education. I may have been here only for one term, but I have grown in knowledge and experience beyond what words can express." -Yllka Pacarizi, spring 2017, Kosovo "Studying at the University of Kansas as an exchange student was a life changing experience for me. My stay at KU not only benefited me academically, but also allowed me to get unique insights into American culture and grow as a person. The exchange program also gave me the chance to become friends with people from all over the world and learn about their cultures. Everyone at KU - students, faculty, and staff - was very open and welcoming towards us international students, which is one of the reasons why it was easy to get a sense of belonging and feel like a true Jayhawk." -Lucas Burkhardt, spring 2017, Germany "I always thought that studying abroad was going to be a difficult experience. But I soon realized that at KU everyone makes you feel comfortable, and that makes you feel that you belong here, that you are part of a something big, the KU family. It's really hard to believe that time flies and now I have to leave behind all my friends, all the people I met, everything. However, it's good to know that this will always be my home far from home, because once you become a Jayhawk, you are always a Jayhawk." -Ingrid Flores, spring 2017, Chile "KU is an amazing place… all kinds of activities are hosted by KU and they help visiting students immediately integrate into the campus and the city. Besides, the flexibility to enroll in courses makes KU an ideal place to study." -Mi Wang, fall 2015 & spring 2016, China KU Today Why KU Apply » One of 34 U.S. public institutions in the prestigious Association of American Universities 44 nationally ranked graduate programs. —U.S. News & World Report Top 50 nationwide for size of library collection. —ALA 5th nationwide for service to veterans —"Best for Vets: Colleges," Military Times Give to KU » Contact International Support Services iss@ku.edu 785-864-3617 Routes through main campus 1450 Jayhawk Boulevard Strong Hall, Room 2 Lawrence, Kansas 66045 Emergency After Hours Phone: 785-380-8937 Technical issues with this webpage? email iss@ku.edu Issues with iHawk? email ihawk@ku.edu Academics Accessible KU Admissions Alumni Athletics Campuses Giving Jobs Safety Contact KU Lawrence, KS CMS Login
