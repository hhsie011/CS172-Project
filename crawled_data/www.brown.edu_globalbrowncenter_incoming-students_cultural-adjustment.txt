After entering a new culture or community it is normal and expected that you may feel overwhelmed, excited, nervous, sad, frustrated, and happy all at once. Moving away from friends, family, and the familiarity of home is both positively and negatively challenging. Do not be alarmed or surprised if you find yourself feeling confused or frustrated as you make the big move and adjustment to life in the U.S. Regardless of how big or small the transition process will be for you, remember that you are not alone! At Brown there are many campus offices available to answer questions and offer support. International Orientation and the International Mentoring Program are designed to facilitate the transition and success of all international students. There are also resources in the Providence community, including the International House of Rhode Island.
