To be at the forefront of this trend, we need to leverage Stanford’s rich history of interdisciplinary collaboration to foster an ecosystem where cutting-edge research can incubate and thrive. The Stanford Data Science and Computation Complex is that ecosystem. For a first glimpse, watch this video: A vital part of the future “The university sees the Data Science and Computation Complex as a vital part of our future. It will have a tremendous impact on research and education in data science, computation, and policy at Stanford and beyond.” -Jennifer Widom, Dean, School of Engineering An innovative incubator “We need an ecosystem where great ideas can find the tools and methods and collaborators they need to incubate and thrive. An ecosystem that’ll make our research better, inspire us to ask new questions, and find ways to generate new knowledge.” -Debra Satz, Dean, School of Humanities and Sciences An interdisciplinary collaboration of people and programs working to transform the way we apply data science and computation to make an impact in the real world, the Data Science and Computation Complex will be home to… Stanford Data Science: weaving data science into the very fabric of Stanford research and education. Stanford Impact Labs: reshaping how research is conducted in the social sciences so that it can powerfully influence policy and enable positive change. Vibrant undergraduate programs: Computer Science, Mathematical & Computational Sciences, and Symbolic Systems. Creating knowledge for the future Stanford’s continued ability to advance discovery and create new knowledge will increasingly rely on our ability to learn from data. Stanford Data Science is a collaborative effort spanning Stanford departments and schools that strives to unite existing data science research initiatives and create interdisciplinary collaborations with the ultimate aim of giving our faculty and students the tools, skills, and understanding they need to do the cutting-edge research that will drive 21st century scholarship and education. In its new home, Stanford Data Science will help build a community that brings together the world’s very best data scientists with talented scholars from other fields— ensuring that these scholars are able to work at the very highest level possible.
