Your gift plays an essential role in making this happen. Supporting students Offering financial resources to students helps ensure that equity and inclusion remain at the heart of who we are as a university. Your gift of any size, to an annual fund or to another area you are passionate about, makes a profound difference. Together, we can ensure that each Cornellian has the resources they need and the Cornell experience they deserve. How you can help The most immediate way for you to help is to make a gift to any of the Cornell annual funds. Annual fund gifts are flexible, and allow Cornell to direct support where it is most needed. Annual fund gifts touch every part of the student experience. You can also help students by directing your giving to any area of the university that is important to you. Every gift to the university allows Cornell to continue to teach, conduct world-class research, and make the world a better place. Giving back to an area you love means you make a difference for a student just like you. Seasonal Zoom backgrounds ðŸŒ¸ Spring is here on campus!
