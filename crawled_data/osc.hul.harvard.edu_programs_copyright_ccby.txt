Our web pages provide public access to a wide range of materials in many media, including online exhibits, digitized text collections, digital image repositories, archival finding aids, and our catalog. Enabling open access to these collections and resources goes hand in hand with Harvard Library’s commitment to the widespread dissemination of knowledge.
