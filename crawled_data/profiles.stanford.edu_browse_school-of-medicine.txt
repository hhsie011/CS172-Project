Aalami, MD Clinical Professor, Surgery - Vascular Surgery Current Research and Scholarly InterestsWe launched a national precision medicine PAD trial called, VascTrac (http://vasctrac.stanford.edu/). This trial is mobile phone based and leverages Apple's ResearchKit Platform to monitor a patient's activity both pre- and post-intervention. We are validating mobile phone surveillance for PAD patients and are currently enrolling.

During my undergraduate, I served as the Team Captain of the ETSEIB Formula Student team, where I helped develop the first electric vehicle for the school. After graduating, I went on to obtain an MS from the Electrical & Computer Engineering department at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas. There, I joined the Center for Bioinformatics and Genomic Systems Engineering, where I was involved in several computational genomics research projects under Dr. Aniruddha Datta. In 2015, I was awarded the “la Caixa” fellowship to pursue research in computational biology during my Ph.D. as a member of the Goutsias lab, developing computational methods to study epigenetic signatures in close collaboration with the Feinberg lab of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. In addition to my research and Ph.D. coursework, I earned an MS focused on statistical learning from the Applied Mathematics & Statistics department at Johns Hopkins University in 2018. After successfully defending my dissertation entitled “Statistical Signal Processing Methods for Epigenetic Landscape Analysis” on May 10 of 2021, I joined Salzman’s lab at Stanford University as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow being awarded the postdoctoral fellowship from the Center for Computational, Evolutionary and Human Genomics.
