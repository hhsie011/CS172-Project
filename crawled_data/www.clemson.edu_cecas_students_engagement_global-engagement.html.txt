Magazine Outreach Ways to Give Clemson Home College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences Students Engagement Current: Global Engagement Global Engagement Global Impact The College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences (CECAS) recognizes that the future marketability of Clemson engineering and science graduates hinges upon being prepared to compete in the global economy. The college is therefore committed to helping stimulate global competence through expanded experiences that immerse students in learning and education via global engagement initiatives and study abroad partnerships. Planning Ahead Interest Form intro-arrow CECAS Abroad Engineering has the power to improve the quality of life and is impacting those with access to its benefits. We invite all CECAS students to accept the challenge and make a difference by getting involved and growing through these rewarding international project opportunities. There are a variety of options available to help obtain international experiences that will last a lifetime and help set you apart from other engineering students and graduates. These experiences include on-campus seminars, creative inquiry projects, international events, and complete overseas trips. Clemson Abroad Cu Exchange Exchange programs involve a trade of students between two institutions. A Clemson student will apply at the Study Abroad office, enroll at the desired university and pay the same in-state tuition to Clemson. Exchange Programs >> Faculty-Led Study CECAS faculty lead study abroad programs (often in the summer), and classes that have a study-abroad component. These programs allow students to enroll in classes at Clemson, avoiding transfer issues. Faculty-Led Programs >> Creative Inquiry Travel Creative Inquiry Study Abroad programs involve specific projects, usually ongoing initiatives involved around helping local communities with infrastructure, healthcare, and sustainable practices. CI Abroad >> Graduates Abroad Graduate students have unique opportunities to enhance their education and research experience - a traditional exchange program or dual degree. The Dual program enables earning a degree at both institutes. Graduate Programs >> Scholarship Opportunities The Study Abroad office works to provide affordable programs to Clemson University students. Application deadlines are typically six months or more before the program starts, so apply early. How to Apply “ “For global engagement, Clemson has tons of opportunities and different funding sources to encourage students to go abroad. I feel part of the Clemson Family. No matter where I go if I see someone wearing Clemson attire or ring or anything, I can be like, "Ah! I can talk to them. I can connect with them." It doesn't matter – I've been all the way in Italy, and someone was wearing Clemson, and I was wearing Clemson, and we were like, "Oh, Go Tigers! Yeah!” Hannah Cash Bioengineering Upcoming Events Clemson University offers events, seminars, sessions, and workshops throughout the year. Please join us! Study Abroad Events Planning Ahead An international educational experience takes a good bit of planning, from deciding where to travel to financing the trip. Students should start to prepare during their first year as good academic standing is required. The Pam Hendrix Center for Education Abroad offers a Study Abroad 101 video with program options, financial aid info, and how to apply credits. Please fill out the Advising Application to begin. Advising Application Utilize the Clemson Abroad website and program search tool to explore study abroad program options. You can do a general search or filter for specific topics, places, or program focus. Search Programs Students are encouraged to meet with their academic advisors to discuss academic requirements and identify potential classes or subjects they will be able to take while abroad. In addition, students should meet with a Study Abroad Advisor to discuss specific program-related questions. CU Navigate The final step is to select a program and apply. If you need additional assistance, please reach out to the Study Abroad office. They can answer any questions and what to expect while abroad.
