The students visit contemporary art studios and hear from prominent artists, curators and gallery owners, many of whom are accomplished Syracuse University alums. Through these interactions, the students get a glimpse into life in the professional art world and the impact of Los Angeles on the global art community. Past trips have included collection and site visits such as the Hammer Museum at UCLA, MOCA, the Broad Art Foundation, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Broad Contemporary Art Museum, the Getty Center, Disney Studios, Cherry and Martin Gallery, Gagosian Gallery, Watts Towers, Culver City Galleries, and Regan Projects, as well as visits to artists' studios, curatorial talks, and a visit to San Pedro. The practicum program was created in 2010 through a gift from VPA alumna, Regional Council, and Advisory Council member Marylyn Ginsburg-Klaus ’56, G’57, and her husband, Charles Klaus.
