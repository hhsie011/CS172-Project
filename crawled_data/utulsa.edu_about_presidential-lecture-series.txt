Visiting scholars who hold the Darcy O’Brien Endowed Chair are individuals of established reputation who command international respect in their fields and demonstrate a commitment to sharing knowledge. While in residence, these scholars devote considerable time and talent to the student body and greater community through classroom teaching and public lectures. The Darcy O’Brien Endowed Chair provides formal and informal learning opportunities in settings both intimate and all-inclusive.
