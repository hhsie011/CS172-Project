Interested in Studying Latin? Why Study Classics? (PDF) Share Curriculum Classics is at the center of what liberal arts education at Dartmouth can be. The Department of Classics offers a wide-ranging curriculum taught by a research faculty firmly committed to excellence in undergraduate education. We offer courses on every aspect of ancient life and thought, from the Greek and Latin languages to literature, history, philosophy, archaeology and the study of the material cultures of ancient Greece and Rome. Students explore the reliefs on Trajan's Column PreviousNext Studying the Classical World at Dartmouth In keeping with the liberal arts mission of Dartmouth, we offer our students knowledge about the ancient world as well as an education of lasting value to their personal and professional lives. Every course we teach addresses a wider set of critical concerns, such as cultural awareness and literary sensibility, and maintains a steady focus on sharpening our students’ analytical thinking and writing skills. Classical education invites students to share in our appreciation and scrutiny of the legacies of the ancient world. Many of our students have continued their study of the classical world at the graduate level and successfully pursued academic careers in classics, ancient history, classical archaeology, and related fields. Even more of our majors and minors have gone on directly to law school, medical school, veterinary science, business school, banking and finance, architecture, military service, journalism, politics, psychology, economics, history, religion, the ministry, music, physical therapy, and public service in both the government and non-profit sectors. This range of career opportunities is what distinguishes graduates of the Dartmouth Classics department. VIDEO: Liberal Arts at Dartmouth VIDEO: Why Study Classics?

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Classics Curriculum Overview Course Offerings by Term Fall 2021 Winter 2022 Spring 2022 Summer 2022 Fall 2022 Winter 2023 Spring 2023 2023-24 Classical Studies Courses Entry points for Classical Studies Literature, Philosophy, Religion Ancient History Classical Archaeology Language Study -- Latin Latin Classes Placement in Latin Language Study -- Ancient Greek Courses in Ancient Greek Placement in Ancient Greek Majors and Minors Classical Studies track Ancient History track Classical Archaeology track Classical Languages and Literature track Culminating Experience Foreign Study NEW Classics FSP in Spring 2022 Greece Foreign Study Program Rome Foreign Study Program Projects & Awards Classics-Related Projects and Awards Student Research Archaeological Fieldwork Reid/Wiencke Funding for Research Senior Honors Projects Awards & Prizes Faculty Media Projects Annual Lecture Programs Faculty Books Inclusivity News & Events People Our graduates Graduating with a Classics Degree Alumni Support Tell Us Your Story Alumni Stories My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
