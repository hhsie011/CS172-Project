We hope you can join us for this discussion on this important novel chronicling a Chilean family through turbulent years of political and personal strife. “Nothing short of astonishing…In The House of the Spirits, Isabel Allende has indeed shown us the relationships between past and present, family and nation, city and country, spiritual and political values.
