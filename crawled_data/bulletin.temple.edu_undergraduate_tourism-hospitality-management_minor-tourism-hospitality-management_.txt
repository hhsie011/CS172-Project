The tourism and hospitality management program integrates foundational business principles with innovative concepts related directly to the distinct industry of tourism and hospitality. Temple University's Tourism and Hospitality Management program is one of the most established and distinguished programs of its kind in the country. The required courses serve to provide students an overview of different foundational elements of the industry, while elective courses offer more in-depth exposure of the support segments across a number of sectors within the industry. The Minor in Tourism and Hospitality Management is open to non-Tourism and Hospitality Management students only. It provides a good foundation for students who wish to apply to STHMâ€™s Master of Science in Hospitality Management (MSHM) program. The Minor represents an extension of the Certificate in Tourism and Hospitality Management, consisting of six courses (18 credits); two required courses with four additional courses to be selected from the list of electives.
