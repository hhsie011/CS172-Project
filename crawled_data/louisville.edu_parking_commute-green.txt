At intersections, ride in the right most lane that goes in your direction of travel. Scan behind you and signal lane changes and turns. Be prepared for mechanical emergencies with tools and know-how. Control your bicycle by practicing bicycle handling skills. Drink before you are thirsty and eat before you are hungry.
