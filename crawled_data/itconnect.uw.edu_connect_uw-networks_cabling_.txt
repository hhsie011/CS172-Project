Contact UW-IT About UW-IT Network Cabling (Ethernet) Ethernet Installation Ethernet provides high-speed connection to the campus computer network, the Internet, and the World Wide Web. Data transmission rates over Ethernet are much faster than a standard modem. Most UW buildings are already on the campus fiber network, and Ethernet service is available to UW faculty and staff for a one-time installation fee. Currently, there is no recurring charge to Ethernet users on the campus fiber network. Off-campus Ethernet service is also available, but is more expensive, as data lines, hubs, and routers must be leased by the user departments.
