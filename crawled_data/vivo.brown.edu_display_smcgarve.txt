He is an elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and on the editorial board of the American Journal of Human Biology. McGarvey earned a Ph.D. in Anthropology from Pennsylvania State University in 1980, and an M.P.H. in Epidemiology from Yale University. McGarvey is concerned with issues of human population biology and global health, specifically modernization-related induced socio-economic and behavioral changes, genetic and environmental influences on obesity and cardiovascular disease risk factor, and child nutritional status. His research involves low and middle income countries such as Samoa, American Samoa, South Africa, and Kenya.

PubMed Research Research Overview Dr. McGarvey is concerned with issues of human population biology and international health, specifically modernization-related induced socio-economic and behavioral changes, gene by environment interactions on cardiovascular disease risk factors, and child nutritional status and health. His research involves developing-world countries such as Samoa, American Samoa, South Africa and Kenya. Research Statement CURRENT RESEARCH ACTIVITIES Dr. McGarvey is working on three distinct projects. The first is a long-term series of NIH supported studies examining the genetic, physiologic, and behavioral influences on cardiovascular disease risk factors in Samoa and American Samoa in collaboratioin with the Samoa Ministry of Health and the American Samoa Department of Health. The newest project is an investigation of the physiologic and behavioral pathways that may underlie the relationships of a newly found gene variant with adiposity and type 2 diabetes in Samoans. At the same time we are using whole genome sequence data provided by our participation in the NIH TOPMed consortium to conduct whole genome-wide association studies of adiposity and related metabolic phenotypes in Samoans. As part of these studies we focus on detecting interactions between genetic variants and individual level dietary and physical activity factors on these phenotypes. Ongoing collaborations in Samoan communities also focus on maternal and child health with an emphasis on pregnancy health and infant and child outcomes. A recently completed Samoan project was implementation research on the impact of community health workers on the management of type 2 diabetes in American Samoa in collaboration with a primary care health facility. The second concerns collaborative implementation research assessing baby-friendly community and hospital activities to improve exclusive breast feeding levels in Kenya. The third pertains to the impact of migration and urbanization on cardiometabolic conditions in South Africa with Michael White of Brown's PSTC and scientists at the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa.
