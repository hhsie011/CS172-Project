Our Vision Aligned with Clemson University’s commitment to diversity, we envision a welcoming campus that is readily usable and accessible by students with varied characteristics, strengths, and challenges. To that end, we strive to provide access that is proactive, sustainable, equitable, and inclusive to the widest population possible. Our Mission We work with students, faculty and staff to ensure that all students at Clemson have equivalent access to campus curricula, facilities, services, and resources through universal design, accommodations, and creative solutions. Access Commitment Clemson University is committed to providing educational opportunities for all students and assisting them in making their college experience fully accessible and positive. In compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended in 2008, Clemson recognizes a student with a disability as anyone who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activity. SAS coordinates the provision of reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and students experiencing barriers due to inaccessibility. All reasonable accommodations are individualized, flexible and confidential based on the nature of the disability Make A Gift Spectrum Program Ross Cathy ADA Scholarship Application Delta Alpha Pi Honor Society Home Guidelines Student Resources Spectrum Program Faculty Resources Accommodated Testing Barrier Report Registering with SAS Information for Parents FAQ Contact Us Home Admissions Campus Life Academics Visit Outreach Research About Apply To Clemson Undergraduate Graduate Professional Online Education Employment Opportunities Policy/Terms of Use Text Version Web Accessibility Ethics/Safety Hotline Privacy Policy Site Information Copyright © 2022 Clemson University Clemson, South Carolina 29634 864-656-3311 Contact Clemson Stories for the Clemson Family Clemson University on Facebook Clemson University on Twitter Clemson University on LinkedIn Clemson University on Flickr Clemson University on Instagram
