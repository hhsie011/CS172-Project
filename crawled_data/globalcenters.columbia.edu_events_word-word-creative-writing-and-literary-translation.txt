In the dialogue, the professors will reflect about the differences between the writer’s and the translator’s work, the differences of translating different literary genres (such as poetry, chronic, prose, essay), and translation's relationship with the editorial market in Brazil and in the US. Regarding the particularities of the profession in both contexts, the event will also entangle the experience of creating programs for the formation of writers and translators.
