In early September, three representatives of the center-right governing coalition “Chile Vamos” participated in a discussion on the identity, ideological stance and political and economic proposals of the new generation of leaders of the main parties of the alliance. The event was chaired by Isabel Aninat, researcher at the Centro de Estudios Públicos (CEP), and also a Columbia alumna, and was organized by the Santiago Center in association with Chile’s Harvard Alumni Club and the Harvard’s David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies Regional Office. In a lively discussion, Felipe Kast (Senator from Evópoli); Jaime Bellolio (Congressman from UDI) and Diego Schalper (Congressman from RN) addressed, among other issues, the differences between the new generation of party leaders versus those from the “old guard”; the ideological, political and economic similarities and discrepancies between the three main collation partners; how they deal with the burden associated with Pinochet’s dictatorship and the violation of human rights; and the challenges posed by the fact they went from being in the opposition to being part of the government.
