Residential staff are prepared to discuss available options and guide them through the next steps. Some residents may be able to isolate/quarantine in their own room or apartment, depending on their unique situation and where they live. Residents who are from a location beyond a five hour drive from College Station might have the option to isolate/quarantine in an alternate location on campus. Each case will be evaluated individually. On-campus residents are strongly encouraged to be proactive and formulate a plan now for where they will go if they become ill or exposed, even those who are fully vaccinated. Residents who are able to return to their permanent residence to isolate/quarantine are strongly encouraged to do so and save the limited resources for residents who cannot logistically return home to isolate/quarantine. Residents are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the current TAMU COVID-19 Protocols and the University’s COVID-19 guidance. Many questions, especially in regards to academics, are answered in these guides. If You are Diagnosed with or Exposed to COVID-19 Before returning to campus for the spring semester, please consult the current TAMU COVID-19 Protocols for isolation or quarantine guidance. If you need to reschedule your move-in appointment in order to adhere to this guidance, please email askreslife@reslife.tamu.edu to do so. Meals and Laundry while in Isolation/Quarantine on Campus If you isolate or quarantine on campus, you will need to rely on a short-term personal care attendant (friend, roommate, etc.) to bring you meals and assist you with laundry. TAMU Dining will permit your short-term personal care attendant to use your student ID in a dining facility or C-Store to pick up a hot meal, groceries, or a grab and go option for you. For information on TAMU Dining Sick Meals, visit dineoncampus.com/tamu/quarantined-meals. Your short-term personal care attendant must be a current TAMU student, faculty, or staff member. If your care attendant does not live in your residence hall or apartment building, contact your hall/apartment staff for more information on how they can access your building to assist you. COVID-19 Testing and Vaccinations COVID-19 tests, vaccinations, and boosters are available on campus at the Student Health Center. Testing is also available at Curative kiosks around campus. Still Have Questions? If you have further questions, speak with your hall/apartment staff, or email askreslife@reslife.tamu.edu. carlos_elarba2022-01-11T17:02:21-06:00August 13th, 2021|Categories: News & Announcements| Share This Story, Choose Your Platform!
