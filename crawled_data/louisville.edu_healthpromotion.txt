We often get messages suggesting we should find the “perfect balance” in our lives. The problem is that “perfect balance” is un-achievable, un-sustainable and un-desirable. Health Promotion Wellbeing Central (HPWC) promotes a resilience-building approach to life balance that acknowledges that being off-balance is part of the human condition – our natural state of being. It is a requirement for growth, learning, loving, serving and improving. HPWC promotes critical thinking and engagement with resilience-building practices to bring a sense of purpose and intention to our individual daily choices and into the very design of our university community. Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving. -- Albert Einstein HEALTH PROMOTION WELLBEING CENTRAL University of Louisville 2100 South Floyd, W309 (Student Activities Ctr.)
