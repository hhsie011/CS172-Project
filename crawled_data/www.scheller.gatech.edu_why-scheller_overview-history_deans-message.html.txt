This past year will be remembered as one of the most unique and challenging periods of time in our shared history. But even as the pandemic and the challenges it presented wore on, Scheller College remained dedicated to our mission of cultivating ethical, forward-thinking leaders for a tech-driven world. To that end, we continued to create new ways of teaching, learning, researching, collaborating, and growing. Throughout the past year, we were proud to see numerous Undergraduate, MBA, and PhD students become graduates of the College. These students rose above their individual and collective challenges, earning their degrees and entering a new business world prepared to make an impact. As I look back on this year, the creativity and resilience of our community has never been more evident. The quality and caliber of our students, faculty, and staff is reflected in the recognitions and accolades we received this year. Among these include several top rankings: No. 2 in the world for MBA career services (The Financial Times), top 5 in the U.S. for sustainability education in business (Corporate Knights), top 10 in the U.S. for undergraduate programs (Poets&Quants), and top 10 in the U.S. for business analytics, information systems, operations, and supply MBA specialties (U.S. News & World Report). This past year has also been one of continued reflection, learning, and action toward building an inclusive and empowered community. The Scheller Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Council was re-constituted and expanded with that goal in mind. We have made steady progress in recruiting, matriculating, and graduating more students from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds. We have also continued focused efforts in providing inclusive teaching workshops, unconscious bias training, and speaker series featuring leaders in diversity, equity, and inclusion. These opportunities saw record engagement. There is still much work left to do and our commitment to transformative action will continue. Our contribution to the body of business and management thought continued to be strong. Scheller faculty have thrived in our environment of thoughtful discourse, engagement, and rooted connections with corporations, organizations, and government institutions. Our faculty have represented their research and the College through numerous scholarly, industry, and news publications. Furthermore, our faculty pedagogy took on new and unique forms, including the introduction of the new ‘Scheller Lunchtime Live’ LinkedIn livestream series, drawing over tens of thousands of participants from North and South America, Europe, and Asia. The strength of the Scheller community continues to inspire me each day. I am grateful for the work and support of our students, faculty, staff, alumni, and friends. Your contribution is what makes our progress possible. As we step confidently into the future, I look forward to introducing new programs, offerings, and ways of strengthening our community, along with the 2021 - 2026 strategic plan for the College. I welcome you to join me as we open this next chapter of Scheller’s history together – one that will be full of growth and opportunity. Sincerely, Maryam Alavi Dean and Stephen P.
