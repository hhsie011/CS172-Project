The J.S.D. program has extremely limited enrollment; approximately one to three students are admitted each year, most following completion of the LL.M. degree at Cornell Law School. Students who wish to continue their studies after the LL.M. degree from Cornell Law School must generally have all honors grades. Students who meet the requirements for admission but who do not want to become candidates for a degree may, at the discretion of the faculty, be admitted as non-degree students. Further information on the J.S.D. degree may be obtained from the Law School Web site: https://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/admissions/graduate-legal-studies/JSD/JSD.cfm Learning Outcomes The Field of Law expects J.S.D. candidates to conduct original research into specific legal topics of individual interest while deepening their understanding of American domestic law, international law, and/or comparative law, particularly in areas in which Cornell’s faculty is world renowned. In that regard, our J.S.D. students work closely with their selected Special Committee and are encouraged to review our updated Field of Law Handbook each academic year of enrollment. Upon completion of the J.S.D. degree, graduates are expected to have demonstrated proficiency in the following areas: Cultivate and maintain a level of expertise in the general Field of Law that befits the degree level and institutional standards. Demonstrate an in-depth and dynamic knowledge of a specific, major or emerging topic in the Field of Law. Develop necessary effective professional skills, including surveying current events within the field, producing clear and concise writing, and creating well-organized presentations. Adhere to an approved timeline of research and exploration, faculty consultation, writing objectives, and progression towards a comprehensive dissertation defense. Produce original, publishable work(s) of novel and relevant scholarship, including publication of the dissertation in an external publication either prior to completing the degree or upon completion. Participate in topic-specific professional organizations, publications, and conferences in order to maintain a peer scholar network. Successfully complete and pass a Prospectus and B Examination prior to final dissertation submission. Represent and uphold the rigorous academic standards, ideals, and ethics of Cornell Law School and the Cornell University Graduate School throughout the program of study and after graduation.

The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters.
