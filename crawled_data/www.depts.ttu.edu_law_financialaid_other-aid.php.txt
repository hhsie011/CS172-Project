Texas Tech University Directory Raiderlink A-Z Index School of Law Menu Search TTU School of Law Financial Aid Other Types of Aid Out-of-State Tuition Waiver Texas allows an out-of-state student (non-resident) who receives a competitive academic scholarship of at least $1,000 for the academic year to pay the significantly lower tuition rates otherwise available only to Texas residents. This award results in an additional benefit of more than $8,000. Summer Aid Any student who wants to apply for summer financial aid must complete an online Summer Aid Application available from Texas Tech University Financial Aid. These applications are generally available from February 1 to June 20 each year. A separate budget is calculated based on which terms the student is attending. The amounts awarded will vary based on the balance of the academic year loan eligibility that was not borrowed during the previous nine-month award period. Residency Students who move to Texas after reaching the age of 18 are considered to be nonresidents unless they have resided in the state for other than educational purposes for a period of 12 months immediately preceding enrollment. Questions of residency status frequently arise concerning members of the Armed Forces assigned to duty in Texas and persons who have been Texas residents but have moved out of Texas for employment. Applicants in these and other circumstances involving questionable residency status should seek clarification from the Law School.
