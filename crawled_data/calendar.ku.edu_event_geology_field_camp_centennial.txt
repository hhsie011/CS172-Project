There are almost 100 undergraduate geology majors working toward earning a bachelor’s in geology with emphasis in general geology, environmental geology, engineering geology or geophysics. Geology provides a unique experience that takes education beyond the classroom. At the KU Field Camp, Jayhawk geologists apply the skills they learn on the Hill to fieldwork in the mountains of Colorado and Utah, where they use traditional methods and cutting-edge technology to study and map rock formations. We are approaching the centennial of KU Field Camp’s arrival in southwestern Colorado in the summer of 2022. There are three key areas to support to ensure Field Camp endures for a new generation of Jayhawks — student and faculty support, facility upgrades and the next hundred years of Field Camp beyond Cañon City, Colorado.
