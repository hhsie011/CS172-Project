The Graduate School's general policies and regulations are outlined in the Graduate Catalog, and encompass everything from academic misconduct to transferring credit to the minimum requirements for graduation. Department of Communication policies appear in full in its catalog entry select policies are spelled out below. Key Policies Compliance with core University and Departmental policies is presumed, as is a student's satisfactory progress toward degree completion. A student's failure to maintain satisfactory progress can result in a recommendation that s/he exit the program. Before registering for courses beyond 18 hours of study in the department students must choose a major advisor, form an advisory committee, and get their Plan of Study approved by the committee. Students seeking to enroll beyond 18 hours must have an approved Plan of Study, or they will not be cleared to register. Each year, the Graduate Faculty of the Department of Communication convene twice to evaluate the progress of every Master's and Doctoral student in the program. For a student to continue in the program, he or she must maintain satisfactory progress. The student will be judged as NOT making satisfactory progress if: The student's cumulative GPA (during the student's initial 36 hours of coursework in the COMM PhD program) drops below 3.0 and remains there for more than one semester or nine credit hours. The student has acquired more incompletes than he or she can complete during one semester of normal academic work. The student fails the comprehensive exam. The student's coursework does not demonstrate promise for independent scholarly work. To be considered as "making satisfactory progress," Doctoral students must pass comprehensive exams within two semesters of completing 36 hours of coursework and have a dissertation prospectus approved by their advisory committee within two semesters of completion of the comprehensive examination. Documents Familiarity with the various forms, guides and webpages that surround University and Departmental policies ensures a clear path to completing your degree.
