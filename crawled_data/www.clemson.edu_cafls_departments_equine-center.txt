Current outreach programs include: Educational seminars and other continued learning opportunities Applied research on industry-relevant topics Private sales of young horses Summer riding camps for high school students Vision The goal of the Clemson University Equine Center is to be a student-centered, self-sustaining enterprise that serves as a leader in the South Carolina horse industry. History The facility that is now the Equine Center began as the Clemson sheep unit. In the mid-1970s, under the direction of Mr. Butch Kennedy, the farm housed both ovine and equine species, however, in approximately 2000, the CUEC became dedicated to horses alone. In 2009 it came under the management of the Animal and Veterinary Sciences department. The Equine Center has a strong tradition in producing stock horses but has also engaged in breeding both Arabians and Thoroughbreds for research and sales. 2021 marked our 45th consecutive year of producing American Quarter Horses, and the Center now produces top-quality hunter and sport horses as well as western performance and reining prospects. In total, the CUEC maintains a herd of approximately 50 horses for teaching, breeding, outreach, and research purposes. These horses represent a variety of breeds including Quarter Horses, Paints, Thoroughbreds, and Warmbloods. Tours Join us for a tour of the Clemson University Equine Center! Tours are offered Monday through Friday at 3 pm or by appointment. General tours are aimed specifically at prospective students, but please feel free to contact us if you have a special area of interest.
