Students Access to Campus Recreation facilities and programs are not automatic for all students. Student Definitions are meant to educate students about membership access during their time as co-op, part-time, or regional campus (UC Blue Ash or Clermont) students. University of Cincinnati students are eligible for membership through payment of the Campus Life Fee. Uptown, full-time students are assessed the full Campus Life Fee. A portion of this fee goes toward funding the debt service and operation of the Campus Recreation Center and the Fitness Center at CARE/Crawley. Payment of this fee in full entitles a student to membership at the facilities during each term the fee is paid. In order to be fair and consistent to all students, a membership fee is charged to any student who does not pay the Campus Life Fee. The amount charged is consistent with what a full time student pays for access through the Campus Life Fee. Student rates based on class status and campus Class status or campus Rate per semester Full-Time Undergraduates & Graduates Included in Campus Life Fee Part-Time Undergraduates (3-11 credit hours) $60/Semester*** Part-Time Graduates (1-9 credit hours) $60/Semester*** Co-op, UC Blue Ash, Clermont, Distance Learning $120/Semester UC Students, Not enrolled current semester but enrolled previous semester $130/Summer Semester **All Student and Short Term Memberships must be paid in full. ***Must be paying part of the Campus Life Fee Student Definitions Full-Time Students - Uptown Campus right arrow down arrow Students enrolled full time (12+ credit hours as an undergraduate student or 10+ credit hours as a graduate students) on Uptown Campus are assessed the full Campus Life Fee which includes Campus Recreation Membership. Co-op Students right arrow down arrow Students pay a co-op fee that goes to the Division of Experience-Based Learning & Career Education to help fund the operation of the co-op program. However, co-op students do not pay the Campus Life Fee, which determines access to the Campus Recreation Centers. Since co-op students do not pay any of the Campus Life Fee, they are assessed a fee of $120 per semester for Campus Recreation membership. Students enrolled in co-op and as a part time student simultaneously would be charged the part-time membership rate. Part-time Students right arrow down arrow Students who are part time (3-11 credit hours as an undergraduate student or 1-10 credit hours as a graduate student) pay a portion of the Campus Life Fee. Since part time students pay only a portion of the Campus Life Fee, they are assessed a fee of $60 per semester for Campus Recreation membership. UC Blue Ash & UC Clermont Students right arrow down arrow Students enrolled at UC Blue Ash and UC Clermont, regardless of whether they take classes or live in a residence hall on main campus, do not pay the Campus Life Fee, which determines access to the Campus Recreation Centers. Since regional campus students do not pay any of the Campus Life Fee, they are assessed a fee of $120 per semester for Campus Recreation membership. Distance Learning Students  right arrow down arrow Distance Learning Students pay a distance learning fee that helps fund the operation of the distance learning program. However, distance learning students do not pay the Campus Life Fee, which determines access to the Campus Recreation Centers. Since distance learning students do not pay any of the Campus Life Fee, they are assessed a fee of $120 per semester for Campus Recreation membership.
