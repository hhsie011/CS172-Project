Tuition and fee charges for the Spring Semester are due by Feb. 15.

Direct Deposit is a banking term used to refer to the transfer of funds that are paid directly to your checking or savings account rather than issuing you a paper check. Log in to myOKSTATE, click eRefund under Payment Info, select eRefunds tab and then set up an account. (See more information on the OSU Office of the Bursar website.) Direct deposit will transfer any overpayment of the Bursar account to your bank account within 48 hours. What is a 1098-T and why do I need one? This form is intended to assist you or your parents in the preparation of your federal income tax return. The University sends them out to assist you in preparing your taxes and reports the information to the Internal Revenue Service. Your accountant, tax preparer or the Internal Revenue Service can best advise you in the utilization of this form when preparing your taxes. View this publication from the IRS for more information. How do I obtain my 1098-T? All 1098T forms are mailed to the billing address listed in SIS and are postmarked by January 31. You may also print a 1098T online from the OSU Bursar page. Log in to the page, click on 1098T information, and select the year you need. Can I charge books to my Bursar Account? In order to charge books to your account in Tulsa, you must have financial aid that will more than cover your tuition and fees. Any overage can be used to obtain a book voucher. See the Financial Aid office for details. How do I authorize others (parent) to view my Bursar bill online? Go to the OSU Bursar page login.
