Overview Courses Undergraduate Programs Graduate Programs Minors Faculty Emerging technologies continue to dramatically alter the way business and life is conducted. Those who wish to have a leading role in developing and implementing next generation information systems should consider a career in management information systems, including the sub-fields of data science and information assurance/cybersecurity. The need for knowledgeable workers with expertise in these information systems driven areas will continue to increase at substantial rates for the foreseeable future. The Department of Management Science and Information Systems offers an undergraduate major in management information systems (MIS) with possible options of data science and information assurance (IA). It also offers graduate studies leading to master's degrees in information assurance (MSIA) and management information systems (MIS). Also, PhD degrees in business administration with an option in MIS, information assurance, management science and operations management can be earned. Undergraduate degrees in MIS require a common foundation of work in disciplines such as mathematics, statistics, behavioral sciences and communications. A second tier of required work consists of the courses required for all Spears School of Business students such as economics, marketing, accounting and management. The third tier of classes are core MIS courses that develop information technology, data science and cybersecurity expertise in students. Management Information Systems (MIS) The MIS degree focuses on the business applications of information technology. This includes emphasizing necessary skills required in the analysis, development, evaluation and implementation of various information and communication technologies critical for today's global organizations. The integration of information technology throughout all aspects of business coupled with the critical need for responsive information systems has created a strong demand for graduates with expertise in information systems and business administration. Once MIS students satisfy the first two tiers of requirements mentioned above, they will focus on specialized courses in areas such as systems analysis and design, web and mobile app development, database design and management, data science techniques and applications, data communications and cybersecurity, among other relevant areas. Data Science The data science option allows developing aptitudes in quantitative tools that are especially critical in today's data-driven organization. Additional course work in statistics, and descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics is possible with a Data Science option. Information Assurance The Information Assurance option uses the expertise in the department that led OSU to be named a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education and Research by the NSA and the Department of Homeland Security. This option provides students with in-depth study and hands-on analysis of critical organizational issues in information assurance and cybersecurity. MSIS 2103 Business Data Science Technologies Description: The class focuses on problem solving with data analytics tools and technologies that are key to organization decision making.

Credit hours: 3 Contact hours: Lecture: 3 Contact: 3 Levels: Graduate Schedule types: Lecture Department/School: Mgmt Sci & Info Sys Management Information Systems, BSBA Management Information Systems: Data Science, BSBA Management Information Systems: Information Assurance, BSBA The Department of Management Science and Information Systems offers courses that lead to the completion of the Master of Business Administration (MBA), the Master of Science in management information systems (MIS) and the Doctor of Philosophy in business administration (PhD). The Master of Business Administration (MBA) Degree (See "Business Administration.") The Master of Science in Management Information Systems (MIS) Degree This degree program combines strong theoretical concepts with intense hands-on instruction, helping graduates not only to understand business processes and the concepts behind the information systems they work with, but also develop, modify, use and protect these rapidly-changing computing systems through their technical expertise. The MS in MIS is a 33-34 hour program featuring a core of 25 hours (24 for part-time), including a business practicum, plus two options to highlight different interest areas: data science and application development. These options afford the student opportunities to focus on descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics as well as software design and implementation. Admission requirements for the MS in MIS are similar to the admission requirements for the other master's programs in the Spears School of Business. Information about the program is available on the Internet at https://go.okstate.edu/graduate-academics/programs/masters/management-information-systems-and-information-assurance-ms.html. Certificate in Health Analytics There is a dire need for professionals with practical knowledge and skills in health analytics—ones who can convert large data repositories into actionable insight for better decisions to enhance effectiveness and efficiency in the ever more complex and highly competitive health care domain. OSU's internationally ranked MS in MIS program has collaborated with the Center of Health Sciences’ MS in Health Care Administration (HCA) program and the Center of Health Systems Integration (CHSI) research center focused on the intersection of health, healthcare, informatics and analytics/data sciences to create a new, unique interdisciplinary program – a Certificate in Health Analytics. The program requires taking four courses (each three credit hours, totaling 12 credit hours) of coursework. This certificate program allows for the courses to double-count toward a master’s degree and this certificate degree. The Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Degree The PhD in business administration program administered through the Department of Management Science and Information Systems provides intensive study in management information systems, management science, operations management and telecommunications management. It prepares the student for significant professional contributions in university teaching and research. The program is flexible and individually structured to meet the needs and objectives of the candidate. Emphasis is placed on understanding the analytical and theoretical foundations of business administration, applications in the depth area of specialization and development of research capabilities in the discipline. As prerequisites to the program, all candidates are to have completed appropriate basic courses in calculus and statistics. Likewise, candidates are expected to have a basic competence in the major functional areas of business—accounting, finance, management, management information systems, management science and marketing. Competence in the functional areas is usually attained by documenting that the student has recently completed the appropriate graduate courses in each area through a program accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB International). Competence in planning and executing research must be demonstrated in a dissertation. In addition, each candidate must pass a series of comprehensive qualifying examinations, written and oral, and a separate, final oral examination of the dissertation. To enhance teaching skills, all PhD students in residence are required to teach on a quarter-time or half-time basis for at least one semester while earning the degree. Outstanding students with master's degrees in any field of study may apply. The application for admission to the program is evaluated on the basis of the following: undergraduate and graduate grade-point averages, the score on the Graduate Management Admissions Test, a two- or three-page statement describing goals and academic interests, three letters of recommendation, evidence of research potential, and a personal interview when feasible. It is the responsibility of each applicant to ensure that all material related to the above criteria is received by the department.
