Through a case study of the interaction between melodic syllables and audible breaths in American bass-baritone Dashon Burton's 2015 recording of the song sermon "He Never Said a Mumberlin' Word," Beaudoin reveals the expressive power of micro-sounds and asserts the value of "recognizing sounds as they are." "I see no reason to consciously and actively hear past the aural evidence of Burton's breath and body, in the same way that it makes little sense to ignore the facial micro-expressions of an interlocutor as they speak. Such information is expressive, and should be recognized and documented alongside all sounding events. Such attentiveness generates a mode of listening that reckons with a complete, equalizing census of all the sounds present on a given recording," writes Beaudoin. For him, these subtle sounds are more than mere reminders that the performer is a living, breathing, human being—in fact, they're an integral, hyper-expressive part of the musical artwork. If we listen closely, Beaudoin contends, we find in breath sounds "a vivid window into the humanity of music-making." The full article is available here.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Music Undergraduate Music at Dartmouth Major and Minor Courses Spring 2022 Summer 2022 Fall 2022 Winter 2023 Spring 2023 Honors Honors Projects Funding Graduate Overview Apply People Current Students Performance Overview Individual Instruction Student Recitals Performance Laboratories Hopkins Center Ensembles Practice Rooms Instruments and Lockers Foreign Study Overview London FSP Vienna FSP News & Events News Events Arts Awards Leonard J.
