Brown Affiliations Engineering Research Areas nano and micro mechanics of materials | Ruga mechanics | scaling laws On the Web Nano and Micro Mechanics Laboratory The Ruga Mechanics Research Research Overview Professor Kim's research interest is in the solid mechanics of scale bridging, and the nano and micromechanics of solids. He is directing the Nano and Micromechanics Laboratory, where research is aimed at the advancement of science and technology for proper development and improvement of technological infrastructures for the transition from an industrial society to an information society. Research Statement Professor Kim has worked as an engineering scientist, inventor, and educator to contribute to a rapidly evolving society. His research interests are interdisciplinary - solid mechanics of scale bridging, and nano- & micro-mechanics of solids in both experiment and theoretical modeling. Through his research, he has invented numerous new scientific instruments and analytical methods, and he has recently initiated “ruga mechanics” as a new thrust in applied mechanics research. As an educator, he has developed several innovative laboratory course materials, including “Bow and arrow dynamics,” “Wheel and suspension dynamics,” and “Violin and bell dynamics” laboratory course materials. So far, he has advised more than 40 Ph.D. students and Post Docs who are currently in academia or industries. He served as the representative of the Society of Engineering Science to the US National Committee for Theoretical and Applied Mechanics.
