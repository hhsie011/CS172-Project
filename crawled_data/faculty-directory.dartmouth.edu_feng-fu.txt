[show more] This interdisciplinary field of our research has a significant data science component, and integrates applied mathematics, social science, and computer science, evolutionary biology, and statistical physics. Our research aims to facilitate and promote interdisciplinary research that has a foundation on mathematics and also to synergistically connect evolutionary game theory with data science through data-driven mathematical modeling of real-world applications that have broad and significant impact on our society.
