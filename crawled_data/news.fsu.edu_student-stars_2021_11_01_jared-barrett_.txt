I think life is about people, how you can impact them and how you can affect their life in a positive way.” “Integrity first, service before self and excellence in all we do,” are the core values of the United States Air Force. The words also guide Florida State University student veteran Jared Barrett’s work as he seeks to serve both the Air Force Reserve and his fellow veterans on campus. For Barrett, that effort starts by ensuring veterans and students alike feel they are part of the campus community. “There’s that unwritten sense of knowing that any veteran will have your back, and that’s comforting. That’s my community, that’s my family,” Barrett said. “It’s nice to have a community on campus of people that you know will take care of you if you needed it and that you can take care of.” After completing his sophomore year at FSU, Barrett took a year and a half off to enlist in the Air Force Reserve and complete basic training, where he graduated with honors and attended tech school. “Basic training taught me that you can’t complete anything in this life alone, you need to have a team around you,” he said. “My experience at basic training made me realize how diverse this country is. People came from all over the country but we all had one common goal. Our diversity didn’t matter in getting things done. It couldn’t hinder us, it could only help us, it had to help us.” Barrett has received numerous awards throughout his military career, including 44th Maintenance Squadron Airman of the Quarter, 44th Fighter Group Airman of the 2nd Quarter, and a Diamond Sharp Award Winner. He also currently serves as the president of the Rising 6 Committee for his unit. Since returning to college in 2020, Barrett has succeeded academically, earning President’s and Dean’s list honors multiple times. He’s also made it a point to be involved in various parts of campus that drive student veteran success. Barrett currently serves as the internal coordinator for the Veterans Student Union and works as a veteran’s programs administrative assistant at the Student Veterans Center. In these roles, he aids veterans making the transition from military service to campus life, by providing them tangible resources and activities designed to enhance their connection to the university while fostering a community of past, present and future veterans. “Being able to serve the community that I love being a part of is really meaningful to me and it has impacted my life in such a profound way,” Barrett said. “It gives me fulfillment and keeps me going; I want everyone to feel at home on this campus.” Barrett also served as a senator in student government as another way to affect change on campus and make a lasting impact. There, he took up the position of Veterans Student Union senate liaison. “It was another way for me to take the needs of the veteran community and be able to broadcast them to a very diverse group of people who represent the entire campus community to ensure that the voices of veterans are heard,” he said. One of the most recent ways Barrett has honored the veteran community was by placing roses on 13 reserved seats in honor of the 13 service members who died in the Aug. 2021 Kabul attack. “The way he honored our 13 fallen service members recently with honorary seats at an FSU home game is evidence of his heart and capability,” said Billy Francis, director of the Student Veterans Center. “He has my trust, respect and gratitude for his contributions to FSU.” When asked what advice he has for fellow student veterans, Barrett said, “If you need help in any facet of your life, fall back on this community because we are considered one of the most veteran-friendly schools in the nation for a reason. We have an outstanding veteran community here that would love to help you feel welcome.” Following graduation in spring 2022, Barrett plans to commission as an Air Force officer and apply for the interservice physician’s assistant program. He will continue serving while going to school to receive his physician assistant certification (PA-C). Upon receiving his PA-C, he plans to serve the Air Force as a physician’s assistant. “I have a profound interest in medicine and serving people,” Barrett said. “I think life is about people, how you can impact them and how you can positively affect their life.” Related Links Air Force Reserve Veterans Student Union Posted in: Student Stars | Tagged: FSU Student Star, Veterans Student Union Post navigation Previous Article Previous Article: Carly Fulcher Next Article Next Article: Christelle Bucag Sidebar Related Stories Kayla Duncan Hannah Fulk Daniel Zuñiga Emmabella Rudd Scott Clemons Recommended Stories FSU Expert Pitch: FAMU-FSU College of Engineering center pushes preparation for storm season Nine FSU students earn Fulbright Scholarships Triumph Gulf Coast board approves $7.6M grant for FSU PC’s Collegiate Laboratory High School Florida Center for Reading Research partners with Maya’s Book Nook to strengthen reading development in Leon County FSU dance professor continues to be recognized as trailblazer in performing arts Search Florida State News Search for: Categories: Any Category Announcements COVID-19 Announcements Multimedia FSU Headlines Photo Galleries Radio Stories Video Stories News Arts & Humanities Business, Law & Policy Education & Society Expert Pitches Faculty/Staff Briefs Health & Medicine Science & Technology Students & Campus Life University News Student Stars The Big Story Uncategorized News Archives News Archives Select Month May 2022 April 2022 March 2022 February 2022 January 2022 December 2021 November 2021 October 2021 September 2021 August 2021 July 2021 June 2021 May 2021 April 2021 March 2021 February 2021 January 2021 December 2020 November 2020 October 2020 September 2020 August 2020 July 2020 June 2020 May 2020 April 2020 March 2020 February 2020 January 2020 December 2019 November 2019 October 2019 September 2019 August 2019 July 2019 June 2019 May 2019 April 2019 March 2019 February 2019 January 2019 December 2018 November 2018 October 2018 September 2018 August 2018 July 2018 June 2018 May 2018 April 2018 March 2018 February 2018 January 2018 December 2017 November 2017 October 2017 September 2017 August 2017 July 2017 June 2017 May 2017 April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 July 2007 June 2007 May 2007 April 2007 March 2007 February 2007 January 2007 December 2006 November 2006 October 2006 September 2006 August 2006 July 2006 June 2006 May 2006 April 2006 March 2006 February 2006 January 2006 December 2005 November 2005 October 2005 September 2005 August 2005 July 2005 June 2005 May 2005 April 2005 March 2005 February 2005 January 2005 News Topics Arts & Humanities Business, Law & Policy Education & Society Health & Medicine Science & Technology Students & Campus Life University News All News Faculty/Staff Briefs Expert Pitches Multimedia Video Stories Radio Stories Photo Galleries FSU Headlines All Multimedia About FSU The Big Story Student Stars Publications Highlights/Rankings Seminole Tribe For Journalists News Contacts Media Resources Experts Expert Categories Title IX © Florida State University Tallahassee, FL 32306 FSU Directory Assistance Questions or Comments Privacy Policy Copyright Like Florida State on Facebook Follow Florida State on Instagram Follow Florida State on Twitter" Follow Florida State on Youtube Connect with Florida State on LinkedIn More FSU Social Media
