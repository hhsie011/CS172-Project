Agricultural Education 2013 Executive Director, CAFLS Alumni Relations and Career Services Ben Skelley CAFLS Alumni Board President "I am blessed to be a part of the CAFLS alumni family. As a student, my advisors, mentors, instructors, career counselors, and peers were all instrumental in preparing me for a robust career in my chosen field. Choosing to be a part of CAFLS was one of the best decisions I made. I am fortunate that I am able to continue my engagement with CAFLS through serving on the Alumni Board.
