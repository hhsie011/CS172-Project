Guarini Institute for International Education Share Vienna FSP Vienna FSP Spring 2018 Vienna FSP Spring 2018 Vienna FSP Spring 2018 Vienna FSP Spring 2018 Vienna FSP Spring 2018 PreviousNext About The Department of Music offers a foreign study program in Vienna, Austria, and is operated in partnership with a third-party provider, IES Abroad. The music foreign study program provides an opportunity for students to combine the study of music with an intensive exposure to musical performance while living in Vienna. The program is open to vocalists, instrumentalists, and composers, as well as to students whose focus is on music history, theory, or ethnomusicology. Courses offered include MUS 70: Perspectives in Music Performance (taught by the FSP director), which focuses on historical, analytical, and practical aspects of performance, and includes attendance at some thirty public performances; MUS 74: The History of Music in Central Europe (taught by a team of local lecturers); and MUS 87: Special Studies in Music Abroad, consisting of individual lessons. Student musicians will also reap the benefits of a term in Vienna. The opportunity to attend concerts and rehearsals, meet performers and artists, and experience firsthand the vibrant musical traditions of Central Europe offers unique learning opportunities outside the classroom. Selection will be based on a student's interest in music as demonstrated by past study and performance ability. Enrollment is limited to 16 students.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Music Undergraduate Music at Dartmouth Major and Minor Courses Spring 2022 Summer 2022 Fall 2022 Winter 2023 Spring 2023 Honors Honors Projects Funding Graduate Overview Apply People Current Students Performance Overview Individual Instruction Student Recitals Performance Laboratories Hopkins Center Ensembles Practice Rooms Instruments and Lockers Foreign Study Overview London FSP Vienna FSP News & Events News Events Arts Awards Leonard J.
