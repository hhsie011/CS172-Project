Among the major facilities upgrades on campus enabled by the campaign, Brown opened a state-of-the-art Engineering Research Center home to specialized facilities for nanoscale and biomedical engineering. PROVIDENCE, R.I. [Brown University] — More than a year ahead of its planned December 2022 end date, BrownTogether, the most ambitious fundraising campaign in Brown University history, has eclipsed its original $3 billion goal. Given continued momentum in support of BrownTogether’s vision for strengthening Brown, and its positive impact on everything from student scholarships to community engagement initiatives to research on pressing issues, the University will extend the campaign timeline. In the coming months, Brown’s senior leaders and members of the Corporation of Brown University will update the campaign’s priorities and establish a revised fundraising target and new end date. President Christina H. Paxson said the remarkable generosity of Brown alumni, parents and friends is deepening the educational experience for talented students and enabling scholars on campus to make an ever-increasing impact on societal challenges with implications well beyond campus. “The momentum and community commitment behind BrownTogether has been simply extraordinary, and we will build on that energy and philanthropic engagement in ways that enable Brown to make a meaningful impact both at home in Rhode Island and across the globe,” Paxson said. “We will continue to focus fundraising for initiatives central to our mission — making a Brown education accessible to the best and brightest students, attracting leading scholars to teach and conduct research in a spirit of free inquiry, and advancing discovery in areas where we can make breakthroughs that improve lives.” “ Our donors and supporters want to ensure that Brown makes real and lasting change in society and in the lives of our students. ” Sergio Gonzalez Senior Vice President for Advancement Launched in 2015, BrownTogether has raised funds that are advancing Brown’s mission through investments in people, innovative research and education, campus infrastructure and the student experience. Sergio Gonzalez, senior vice president for advancement, credits the early success of BrownTogether to the leadership of its co-chairs — Theresia Gouw, Ralph Rosenberg and Joan Wernig Sorensen — and the more than 66,000 alumni, parents, friends, faculty, staff and students who donated and/or inspired others to support Brown’s mission. “Over the course of the campaign, and time and time again, our alumni and donor community has stepped up and come together in extraordinary ways,” Gonzalez said. “We reached the original $3 billion goal sooner than we could have imagined, and it’s clear that the Brown community is not yet finished. Our donors and supporters want to ensure that Brown makes real and lasting change in society and in the lives of our students.” Read the full story on News from Brown BrownTogether Our most ambitious fundraising campaign in history is advancing Brown’s teaching, research, and service-to-the world mission in life-changing ways.
