In the Neuroscience BS program, you’ll observe and participate in ongoing studies taking place on campus and at external research sites. You’ll also have access to state-of-the-art equipment and techniques to study fundamental brain processes, and learn to apply your knowledge and experience to the treatment of neuropathologies. In your coursework, you’ll study brain anatomy and physiology; brain development and aging; cellular dynamics; diseases of the brain; molecular genetics; and relations between the brain and human behavior and cognition. Courses for the Neuroscience Major also focus on cell structure and function, cellular and molecular neuroscience, chemistry, cognitive neuroscience, and neurobiology. Small class sizes provide students with personal attention from faculty mentors as well as valuable networking opportunities with neuroscience experts. In addition, the Neuroscience Major allows you the flexibility to design a multidisciplinary curriculum that meets your specific area of interest and helps you gain experience in a diverse range of professional programs. Neuroscience majors are prepared for professional schools in the health sciences, such as medicine and dentistry, and graduate programs in biology, chemistry, psychology and more. Graduates may also find their skills in demand in fields such as law and business where issues of public policy may require an understanding of brain sciences and human behavior.
