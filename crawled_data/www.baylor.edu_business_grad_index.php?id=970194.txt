The traditional two-year track consists of a didactic phase and a residency phase. During the 12-month didactic phase at Fort Sam Houston, Army-Baylor students complete 57 hours of graduate coursework toward a Master of Health Administration (MHA) awarded by the Baylor University, or alternatively, 78 hours to be applied to a joint MHA/MBA degree from Baylor University. The Army-Baylor Program falls under the Hankamer School of Business at Baylor University. After the didactic year, students complete a 12-month Administrative Residency at a designated residency location. During this residency experience, students integrate graduate management and health administration concepts and principles in an applied setting under the mentoring supervision of a highly qualified preceptor. Residents receive thorough exposure to various organizational challenges in the marketplace and complete a portfolio of projects to enable organizations to operate more efficiently and effectively. The Program is fully accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education (CAHME) and the joint MHA/MBA degree is awarded with accreditation standing from the Association for the Advancement of Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB).
