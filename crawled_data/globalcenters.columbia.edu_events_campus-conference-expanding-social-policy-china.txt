The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China held in October 2017 reiterated these goals, with a specific emphasis to address the growing tension between "unbalanced and inadequate development and people's ever-growing needs for a better life." Against this backdrop, the China Center for Social Policy will host an all-day conference on "Expanding Social Policy in China" on March 21, 2018, at Columbia University in New York City. The conference will invite leading social policy scholars and practitioners from around the world to come together and hold a dialogue on four themes: 1) recent trends and developments in social policy in China; 2) poverty, inequality, and public policies; 3) child development and well-being; and 4) future directions of social policy in China, taking into consideration the influences of political, economic, cultural, and other factors. The conference is free and open to the public. The conference is co-sponsored by Columbia Global Centers | Beijing, Columbia School of Social Work, the Weatherhead East Asian Institute at Columbia University, the Confucius Institute, and the China Institute for Income Distribution at Beijing Normal University.
