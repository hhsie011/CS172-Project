The Weill Institute opened in June 2008, with a vision to create a vibrant center of scientific excellence in basic biology integrated with existing, outstanding programs in chemistry and chemical biology, microbiology, plant biology, computational biology, genetics, and engineering. We have sought to attract the best faculty, students, and postdocs and to establish an environment that encourages cutting-edge research and the transfer of ideas and technology.

(June 2021) About the Weill Institute The Weill Institute is an interdisciplinary hub of life science research at Cornell. Our faculty perform cutting edge cell biological research, from basic molecular mechanisms to human diseases. We bring together faculty, students, and postdocs from various departments and graduate fields, representing research areas that might not otherwise engage in crosstalk. The Institute is currently broadening and deepening its impact across the campus here in Ithaca and at Weill Cornell Medicine in NYC through increased engagement and leadership in multiple life science initiatives. Core Values World-class research requires a mind open to new ideas and discoveries. The drive to discover and to create lives in each of us. The Weill Institute is committed to a diverse and inclusive community with the highest level of integrity and professional standards. We desire to promote a positive, equitable and creative environment, including freedom from harassment and discrimination. These commitments reflect our institutional values. We work to adhere to them through our policies, employment and management practices. Member Spotlight Fenghua Hu Fenghua Hu is an Associate Professor in the Department of Molecular Biology & Genetics and a member of the Weill Institute for Cell & Molecular Biology. The Hu lab is interested in studying signaling pathways and mechanisms involved in neuro-degeneration, and in dissecting the disease mechanism of Frontal temporal lobe degeneration (FTLD) due to mutations in the progranulin gene.
