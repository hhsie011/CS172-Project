Students develop that focus through their coursework, taking courses in diverse areas such as social inequality, family and gender, organizations, environmental sociology, race and ethnicity and globalization. Students refine their interests during the senior seminar and through their completion of a senior thesis or capstone project. The concentration also allows students to pursue the Engaged Scholars Program (ESP). ESP is for students with an interest in making deeper connections between their concentration and long-term community-engaged activities such as internships, public service, and many other possible forms of community involvement.
