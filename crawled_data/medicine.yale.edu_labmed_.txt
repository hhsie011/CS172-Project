Its roots can be traced back to the work of John Peters, who, as head of the Metabolic Division of the Department of Medicine at Yale in the 1920's and 30's, established methodologies for the rigorous examination of the chemical composition of blood and urine that brought quantitative discipline to the study of human metabolism publishing the seminal volumes Quantitative Clinical Chemistry, Methods and Interpretations in 1931-32. This tradition of excellence, innovation, and evidence-based inquiry drives the Department. The department has over 30 faculty involved in basic and applied biomedical research. The research interests of the faculty include immunology, stem cell biology, asthma/allergies, advanced cell therapy, biomarker discovery, cancer and molecular genetics, data science (computational healthcare and imaging), epilepsy/neuroinflammation, immunohematology and transfusion medicine, and microbiology/virology. Faculty are involved in teaching residents, medical students, graduate students (PhD), and Yale undergraduates.
