Using a blend of academic disciplines and a global perspective, our students and faculty use their knowledge to identify, explore and develop solutions to the challenges facing people today. Students learn not only to serve people, but to understand and analyze the complex relationships and institutions that shape their lives. Choosing Human Ecology Human Ecology's academic programs are flexible, profoundly interdisciplinary and framed in a liberal arts based foundation. All programs provide students with a firm grounding in contemporary issues, as well as in the social, natural and physical sciences and design. Our students delve into biology and chemistry, economics, psychology and sociology, and apply their expertise in fields such as business, design, health/medicine, law, nutrition, public health, public policy and research. Community connections Our community is comprised of outwardly-focused and inwardly-motivated students who are actively and intellectually engaged in communities. They appreciate multiple perspectives and global experiences and are unafraid to take a novel approach to creating a better world through social and systemic change. Breadth of study Here, professors and students collaborate to understand a broad range of issues such as the financial impacts of tax legislation and social security reform, the design of safer and more sustainable work spaces, the social and physical repercussions of obesity in children and adults, educational policy, how our healthcare system can accommodate our aging population and more. The best of large and small institution experiences Located in beautiful Upstate New York, our mid-sized college is home to approximately 1,250 undergraduates, 200 graduate students and over 100 full-time faculty. Students enjoy the resources of an Ivy League research university and the advantages of a smaller school. Get to Know Us Flip through our Viewbook* Is Human Ecology right for you?

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America.
