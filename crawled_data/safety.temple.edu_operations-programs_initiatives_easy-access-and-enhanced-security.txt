When visitors enter Pearson/McGongile, 1700 North Broad or Annenberg Hall, they can simply tap or slide their TUID and their picture will appear on a monitor to verify their identity. This initiative is part of an on-going plan that that has been spearheaded by Campus Safety and is a collaborative effort with Computer Services and the Office of Facilities Management. Providing this technology in all buildings would be ideal, and we are looking at ways to implement this in some of our more challenging buildings. Feedback from staff and students has been positive and our department truly appreciates everyone’s cooperation in presenting their identification when they enter buildings.
