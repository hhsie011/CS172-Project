This includes examination of the fate and control of pollutant releases to the atmosphere, the impact of processes involving chemistry, aerosols and clouds on precipitation and the Earth's radiation balance, and also impact on human and environmental health. Our specialty is in these areas are: Air Quality and Heath Clouds and Climate Change We aim to create an intellectually driven experience for students. We encourage any interested student or post-doc to contact any of the faculty.
