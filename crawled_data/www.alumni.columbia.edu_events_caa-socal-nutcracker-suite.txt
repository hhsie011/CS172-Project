Nutcracker season is upon us! Please join us for the American Contemporary Ballet's interpretation of the Tchaikovsky classic on Sunday, Dec 5 at 2pm PST. We have secured a discounted rate for prime seat tickets! This is not your average Nutcracker ballet performance - in 2017, ACB debuted the world’s first immersive staging of The Nutcracker Suite with Tchaikovsky’s score performed live by musicians (ACB is the only ballet company in Los Angeles to perform exclusively to live music!) and dancers appear in front of you, in an intimate space without the barrier of a traditional proscenium stage. Seats are extremely limited!
