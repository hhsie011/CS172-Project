In fact, every degree we offer has a guaranteed applied learning or research experience built right into it equipping you with the relevant skills and experience to make you workforce ready before graduation. Learn about our innovative approach Admission to the program Admission requires the completion of a Bachelor of Music Education (BME) degree, or equivalent, from an accredited institution. Students holding bachelor's degrees in music other than the BME must satisfy public school certification requirements to qualify for full admission. Applicants without such certification are admitted on a conditional basis pending their attainment of public school teaching credentials. For additional admission details, click on the link below. Admission requirements Inside the Program Playing the trumpet is easier with WSU invention Music education students have the opportunity to learn from innovative faculty. David Hunsicker is not only a longtime musician. The associate professor of trumpet is also an inventor and business owner. Hunsicker partnered with WSU's National Institute for Aviation Research and WSU Ventures to create the Gapper, a flexible plastic device that allows musicians to control the third valve slide. Hunsicker says the ring on the third valve slide tends to too big for musicians with smaller hands. The gap between the finger and the ring causes a delay in moving the slide, which results in a missed note. The Gapper fixes that problem. Curriculum The program offers several options: coral and elementary music, instrumental conducting, instrumental music (with recital option), music in special education, and voice. MME programs range from 32-36 credit hours.
