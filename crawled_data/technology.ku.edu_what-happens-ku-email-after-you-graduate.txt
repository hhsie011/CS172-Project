Mon, 05/02/22 SHARE: Share by Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Graduating students should tie up digital loose ends to close out their KU email, OneDrive for Business and other accounts. Graduating students are making post-graduation plans as they prepare to embark on a new chapter in their lives. Along with other plans, students who are leaving KU need to tie up some digital loose ends. Students who are graduating in May will lose access to most KU services and accounts 210 days after leaving the university, including KU email. KU Information Technology encourages students to begin transitioning their KU email to a personal email account by setting an autoreply message now that tells people to contact them at their non-KU email address. All KU students can use Microsoft Office 365 at no cost while they are in school. But when students graduate, Microsoft Office 365 will stop working immediately. Personal and family Office 365 subscriptions are available directly from Microsoft. If other members of your family need Office 365, the family plan provides access for up to six people. Students also lose access to OneDrive for Business immediately after graduation. If they have files stored in OneDrive for Business, they should move that data to another personal storage option, such as a personal OneDrive account or Google account. Files also can be downloaded to a computer or external hard drive. Students will never lose access to their KU Online ID or Enroll & Pay, and they will be able to access grades, finances, transcripts and other information in the future. Learn more about personal accounts when leaving KU. KU IT celebrates the success of our graduating students and wishes them much success as they begin a new and exciting chapter. Students who have questions or need help wrapping up their digital presence at KU can contact our IT Customer Service Center at 785-864-8080 or itcsc@ku.edu.
