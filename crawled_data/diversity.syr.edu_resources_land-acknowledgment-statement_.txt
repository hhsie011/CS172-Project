Among them is the University’s policy of opening public events with an acknowledgement of the Onondaga Nation. The land acknowledgement is to be used to open university-wide, public events hosted by Syracuse University to acknowledge our deep connection and respect for the Haudenosaunee people. “I acknowledge with respect the Onondaga Nation, firekeepers of the Haudenosaunee, the Indigenous people on whose ancestral lands Syracuse University now stands.” More from this Section Bias, Racism, and Prejudice Black, Indigenous, People-of-Color (BIPOC) Disability and Accessibility Inclusion Policies LGBTQIA+ community Religion Resource Center Diversity and Inclusion Commitments DACA/Undocumented Students © Syracuse University.
