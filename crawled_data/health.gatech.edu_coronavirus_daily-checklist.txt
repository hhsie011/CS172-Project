Safety is our shared responsibility. Do you have a fever (temperature over 100.4º F or 38º C) without having taken any fever-reducing medications?  Do you have a loss of smell or taste? Do you have a cough? Do you have muscle aches? Do you have a sore throat? Do you have shortness of breath? Do you have chills? Do you have a new or unusual headache? Have you experienced new onset of any gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or loss of appetite in the last few days? Have you, or anyone you have been in close contact with for 15 cumulative minutes in a 24-hour period, been diagnosed with Covid-19 within the last two weeks? If you are fully vaccinated (and it has been less than 5 months since completing your primary series of Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or less than 2 months since your J&J vaccine), or you have received a booster dose of vaccine, and you are asymptomatic, you do not need to quarantine following a known exposure to Covid-19. However, recent guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) state you should get tested 5 days after your exposure, even if you don’t have symptoms. You should also wear a well-fitting face mask in public indoor spaces for 10 days following exposure or until your test result is negative. If you become symptomatic, isolate yourself from others, get tested for Covid-19, and inform your healthcare provider of your vaccination status. Have you been asked to self-isolate or quarantine by a medical professional or a local public health official within the last ten days? Remember, stay home if you develop any illness symptoms – even if you think it is a common cold.
