Full Earth Week Calendar Take the April Sustainability Challenge Join The Whole U and UW Sustainability for a fun, 30 Day Sustainability Challenge during Earth Month. Each day, challenge yourself to follow a sustainable tip and expand your knowledge on how to be more environmentally conscious. Do them on your own or with a friend or family member. The connection that we have to nature, plants, and the land is integral to our health and all that we are. Earth Month reminds us to take care of our planet—whether it’s cleaning up litter, planting more trees, recycling and repurposing, or going on a walk in a green space amidst the wildflowers. Take this time to consciously think about your consumption habits and form new and sustainable practices to help keep our world green.
