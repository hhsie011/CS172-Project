More than 200 music majors and graduate students enrolled at the School choose among numerous degree options: Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Music, Master of Arts, Master of Music, Doctor of Musical Arts, and Doctor of Philosophy. In addition, many non-music majors take private lessons or participate in one or more of the dozens of auditioned and non-auditioned ensembles active in our performance divisions. Non-majors also increase their appreciation of music through various courses in music appreciation and music history that are open to majors and non-majors alike. This program of study leads to the following credentials: Bachelor of Music degree with a major in Composition Bachelor of Music degree with a major in Music Education Bachelor of Music degree with a major in Orchestral Instruments Bachelor of Music degree with a major in Organ Bachelor of Music degree with a major in Piano Bachelor of Music degree with a major in String Instruments Bachelor of Music degree with a major in Voice Admission Requirements Admission is competitive to all music programs. All students must participate in an entrance audition or submit an application and satisfy the requirements of each degree program or track for admittance. Check department website for entrance audition dates. Major status in performance areas is accorded when, after admission to the College of Arts and Sciences is acknowledged and the required School of Music audition is successfully completed, the student commences applied-music study in a performance medium (e.g., voice) with an approved faculty member of the School of Music. In American music studies, music education, composition, and ethnomusicology, additional entrance requirements apply. All music programs require instruction on an instrument. Auditions into freshman-level applied-music instruction (private lessons) are based on the assumption that a student's background includes four to eight years of private study on an instrument. Completion of a further two years of college-level private instruction does not automatically guarantee entry at the junior level of private instruction; placement is determined by an audition. Most degree programs in the School of Music require one to two years of basic piano, to be completed during the course of study at the University. Theory and Ear Training Preparation In preparation for theory and ear training coursework, all students must be evaluated by placement test to determine their levels in music theory and music history. Students who have minimal background in these areas may be required to take MUSIC 113/MUSIC 119 and MUSIC 120. Transfer students who have had at least two quarters of music theory or music history are evaluated by a faculty member the quarter they are admitted to their program. Continuation Policy Performance studies should begin after audition and acceptance, and continue each subsequent quarter of registration until the minimum program requirements for applied-music lessons have been met. Applied-music study should continue as long as the student is registered and in residence until the final approved recital is given. In order to retain major standing, the student must make and demonstrate consistent and acceptable progress at the annual required jury. Concurrent enrollment or participation in at least one School of Music ensemble is required during each quarter in which a student receives MUSAP (applied-music) instruction, at the 300 level and above, except for MUSAP 389/589. Also, basic piano proficiency is required for all majors. Non-keyboard majors must enroll in the MUSAP 133/235 series until appropriate proficiency is attained. Any departure from the above requirements must have the recommendation of the appropriate program chair and the written consent of the Director of the School of Music.
