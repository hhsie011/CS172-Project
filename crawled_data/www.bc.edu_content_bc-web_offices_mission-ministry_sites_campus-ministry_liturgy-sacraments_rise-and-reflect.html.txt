A joint venture between Campus Ministry and Residential Life, it will be hosted by Resident Ministers and other members of the Boston College community from 8:30 - 8:45 a.m. on the last Monday of every month. About How to Attend Additional Resources Contact Rise and Reflect is open to all. Many of our prayer sessions will come from the Christian model, but we’ll also take advantage of the beauty and wisdom found in other religious traditions. It will also include the opportunity to pray for each other and our needs, and to consider what actions our prayer might be calling us to take in our daily lives. Please consider joining us! All sessions will be held in the Maloney 4th floor lobby, between the Office of Residential Life and the Office of Student Affairs.
