Organizing and Managing your Research Monday, February 14th, 2021 12:00pm to 2:00pm Presented by: Graduate Student Panel From project conception to project end, keeping organized is the secret to successful research. To ensure that graduate students have all their research output at their fingertips when it comes time to write their thesis, this workshop will break down the steps needed to stay organized from three different perspectives, STEMM, Social Sciences and the Humanities. We will share tips, tools, and recommended practices to keep research organized throughout the research workflow for an optimal research experience. Start Smart Salary Negotiation Workshop Wednesday, February 16th, 2021 1:00pm to 2:30pm Online Presented by: Dana Bisignani (UC Women's Center) and James Tenney (UC International) Are you a graduate student who is graduating and job hunting this spring? Learn strategies to negotiate your salary once you get a job offer or to ask for a raise at your current place of employment. The gender pay gap - also complicated by race, region of employment, and motherhood - means women make less than their male counterparts in every field. They're also less likely to negotiate their first salary. Earning less makes it harder to pay back student loans, save, plan for retirement, and build financial independence and security. Don’t leave money on the table – learn how to ask for what you’re worth! This workshop is geared toward women and femme individuals, but students of all gender identities are welcome to attend and will gain valuable skills. Workshops UC Workshops UC academic departments and offices also provide workshops of relevance to graduate students. UC workshops are a collegial forum in which students can sharpen skills now while they prepare for their futures. The Academic Writing Center offers free workshops to graduate students on important writing concepts. Workshops are typically one hour, and cover topics such as Creating an Outstanding CV, Composing a Literature Review, Starting Your Dissertation, and Overcoming Writer's Block. Visit AWC's Graduate Tutoring page for their workshop schedule and for graduate writing resources. The Center for the Enhancement of Teaching & Learning (CET&L) offers an array of experiential workshops and learning modules tailored to the needs of graduate teaching assistants, faculty and others interested in improving their teaching. The University Libraries offer workshops on both East and West Campus to support graduate students in their research. Suggest a Workshop! What would you like to learn?
