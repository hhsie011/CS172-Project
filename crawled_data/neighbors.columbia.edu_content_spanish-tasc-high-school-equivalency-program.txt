Achieving a TASC diploma carries the same weight as a High School Diploma, and makes you eligible to apply to and enroll in college as well as significantly expanding your career options and income. The TASC exam covers five core subjects: Reading, Writing, Math, Science and Social Studies. Morning classes run from 10:30-1:30 PM and evening classes from 6-8:30 PM, so they are easy to fit in your schedule. We run our program year-round in three terms: Fall, Spring and Summer.
