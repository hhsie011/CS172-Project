A Jesuit education encompasses many goals—but none more fundamental than the knowledge that by finding God in all things, and working for change, we can each improve the world around us. Creighton’s leadership is responsible for cultivating an institution that makes this stewardship possible. Since 1878, we’ve been committed to ensuring that a Creighton education represents the highest Jesuit values. So when you graduate, you’re able to become leaders who will bring those values to the world. Our President The Rev. Daniel S. Hendrickson, SJ, PhD, is the 25th president of Creighton. He began his tenure in 2015, bringing a global perspective informed by his work across the globe: Fr. Hendrickson has taught philosophy in both Tanzania and the Dominican Republic and has visited 30 countries. Learn more about Fr. Hendrickson Image Image Our Values Leadership that lasts is guided by a clear set of values. Ours are timeless: Commitment to Mission. Cura, or care. Collaboration. And Creativity. Taken together, they mean we elevate learning. We respect the individual. We draw from the power of many to reach our goals. And we approach challenges with open minds and a willingness to evolve. Our Team Creighton’s leadership team includes the President’s Cabinet and President’s Council, each of which are comprised of individuals who represent all aspects of campus life—academics, student affairs, business and more.
