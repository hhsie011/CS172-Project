Lawton Distinguished Professor Quicklinks Make a Report Strategic Plan Anti-Racism Resources Asian Pacific American Heritage Month 2022 April 29, 2022 Asian Pacific American Heritage Month celebrates Asians and Pacific Islanders in the United States. May marks the observance as it commemorates the immigration of the first Japanese people to the United States on May 7, 1843, and marks the anniversary of the completion of the transcontinental railroad on May 10, 1869, which was completed by a majority of Chinese immigrants. The first national celebration of Asian/ Pacific American Heritage was in 1978 when Congress established Asian/Pacific American Heritage Week to coincide with the previously mentioned dates. In 1992, Congress changed the weeklong observance into a monthlong celebration. This Heritage Month celebrates the unique journey of all Asian American and Pacific Islander immigrants and citizens in the United States and their unique life experiences, traditions, and cultures.
