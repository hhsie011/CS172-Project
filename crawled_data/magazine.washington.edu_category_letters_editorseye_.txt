MENU People Features Hub Solutions Arts Sports Letters Editor’s Eye May 29, 2022 Commencement countdown The UW’s newest class of alumni will have their day. And so will those from the two years prior. March 5, 2022 Power of innovation A new UW facility will bring together scientists, engineers and students to develop clean-energy solutions for a healthy planet and a sustainable future. December 4, 2021 All in alignment The impact of the University of Washington was never more clearly on display than when the Legislature turned to it to tackle the state’s mental health crisis. September 11, 2021 The you district When the University of Washington community makes its jubilant return, we are returning to a U District that has been forever changed. June 14, 2021 Fond farewells As we celebrate 12,000 new University of Washington graduates, we also have the special opportunity to honor three academic leaders who are retiring. March 11, 2021 Is normal near? A year after COVID-19 arrived, there are promising signs that we’ll be back on campus soon. December 9, 2020 He taught us how to care The impact of Bill Gates Sr. will continue to be felt throughout Western Washington, and that is a tribute to his ambition to make this a better world. September 16, 2020 The power of community With the world turned upside-down, the bond between the University of Washington and its community has never been stronger. June 24, 2020 Stories of resilience In the face of the COVID-19 crisis, our June 2020 issue tells stories of hope and resilience that are at the core of our UW community. March 11, 2020 Key ingredients Meet our art director and staff photographer. December 9, 2019 Power of pictures Our new-look magazine is a showcase for visual storytelling. September 6, 2019 The agony of September 12 Our editor reflects on the lives lost on 9/12/2001, the day a sightseeing plane full of Husky football fans crashed in Mexico. August 21, 2019 25 years of Columns As our publication evolves into University of Washington Magazine, our editor looks back on a quarter century with Columns. June 3, 2019 Change is afoot The name Columns will soon be retired and the magazine's look will be completely refreshed. December 1, 2018 Gizmos The innovations that come out of the UW are nothing short of mind-boggling. October 3, 2018 Editor’s Eye: Moonshot More than 8,000 first year and transfer students starting at the University this fall. How in the world will they decide what to do? June 6, 2018 The story of Thomas Peter Lantos Lantos, the first and only Holocaust survivor ever elected to Congress, was perhaps the unlikeliest UW graduate of them all. March 7, 2018 A Rather uplifting experience Our editor reflects on meeting one of his journalism heroes, Dan Rather, during the legendary newsman's visit to the UW. December 14, 2017 Farewell to the Boeing 747 The Boeing 747, once the Queen of the Skies, is a winged monument to the University of Washington. September 14, 2017 A love affair with libraries Last year, the UW Libraries were visited 6 million times in person. June 7, 2017 Zigzagging to the stage For nontraditional students, commencement comes with a feisty pride. September 1, 2016 Nourish In a world gone mad with terrorist attacks, mass shootings, racial profiling, police assassinations and baffling presidential election rhetoric, thank goodness there’s an oasis of sanity in the University District that will renew your faith in humankind. At least it does for me. June 1, 2016 Editor's Eye: Quandary When quitting school was the easiest path, it wasn't the right one. March 1, 2016 Editot's Eye: Grateful Each name on the UW's World War II memorial tells a story of sacrifice. December 1, 2015 Editor's Eye: Montlake memories The parking lot known as E-1 holds a lot of memories in its pavement. September 1, 2015 A new U-District This is not a fuddy-duddy column about how great the old days were in the U District. It’s just that with every passing week, the area becomes a bit more unrecognizable. June 1, 2015 Editor's Eye: Aha The best teachers get under our skin, in a good way. They get us up in the morning when we would rather linger in bed after a late night because who would want to miss that infectious enthusiasm? Our favorite teachers make us think and grow and smile. And they push us. March 1, 2015 Editor's Eye: Jim I first met Jim Long five years ago after he'd celebrated his birthday—his 100th. He wanted to touch base with the person who holds the same job he once held. Ever since that day, Jim became a mentor to me. December 1, 2014 125 years together November saw two major milestones—the 125th anniversary of Washington’s statehood for Washington (with a celebration in Olympia run by one of our alums, Gov. Jay Inslee, ’73), as well as the 125th birthday for the UW Alumni Association. Coincidence? September 1, 2014 Editor's Eye: Quake A lot of Husky fans feel something new is in the air, something we haven’t really felt in a long time: hope. June 1, 2014 Editor's Eye: Commencing You have to be bold to be an innovator. You have to have confidence. You have to take a chance. And who better to face that head-on than the thousands of students who will be marching into Husky Stadium on June 14 for Commencement. March 1, 2014 Editor's Eye: Conviction One hundred twenty-five years ago, the stuff of history books and museum displays happened: Washington was admitted to the union as the 42nd state and the Great Seattle Fire of 1889 destroyed most of downtown. That was also the year the UW Alumni Association was formed. December 1, 2013 Editor's Eye: Reimagining It should come as no surprise that a 2009 CHID graduate makes up half of one of the hottest names in hip-hop music today: the local tandem of Macklemore and Ryan Lewis. September 1, 2013 Homecoming In a few short days, we get to come home to our spiffed up Husky Stadium, and boy, will that feel amazing. June 1, 2013 Positive power For me, positive thinking happens more in June than just about any other time of year. That’s because we get to honor our new graduates and recognize those people who make the UW what it is today: a shining star of a public university that serves our citizens in so many ways it’s hard to count. March 1, 2013 Everyday Huskies What amazes me is how many times a day my life is made better by what I call Everyday Huskies. December 1, 2012 Family matters It’s holiday time, and that always brings back memories. September 1, 2012 Making change By educating our state's citizens, searching for solutions to overcome the vexing problems of our time, and creating art and culture that uplifts and challenges us, the University of Washington serves us in many ways. June 1, 2012 Rooting interests The London Summer Olympics are another reason to celebrate the UW. March 1, 2012 Magic in our midst The University of Washington is a place that nourishes us with its stunning, gorgeous physical space as well as the mind-expanding challenges we get in the classroom. December 1, 2011 Purple, gold and green In August, the Sierra Club named the UW as the nation’s most environmentally friendly university in its ranking of the nation’s “Cool Schools.” June 1, 2011 Editor's Eye: Celebration Michael Young’s selection as president-designate of the University of Washington (he starts July 1) turned a glum spring into one of celebration. March 1, 2011 Husky pride One of the most disappointing aspects of the terrible state budget cuts isn’t just that the University of Washington will take a big hit. It’s how easily the state Legislature aimed its budget-cutting ax at the University. December 1, 2010 Under the radar A question we hear a lot at the University of Washington is: What does the state get in return for its investment in the UW? The answer: more than you know. September 1, 2010 Learning without end When you hear questions posed by people outside our campus about the UW, you realize just what an impact this institution has. It fuels the economy, helps us get jobs, provides health care. June 1, 2010 UW endures The President is leaving, the state government doled out yet another discouraging budget cut, and there’s a bit of uncertainty in the air at the University of Washington. But the truth is, that’s only part of the story. March 1, 2010 Ingenuity reigns The UW I find myself returning to is innovative, entrepreneurial, alive. I am lucky to be here, helping tell its stories. December 1, 2009 Editor's Eye: Everyday heroes Devotion to making this world a better place seems to be in the DNA of alumni, staff and faculty at the UW. September 1, 2009 Words touch our hearts One of the things I particularly admire about a place as big and complex as the University of Washington is how it can touch us on an intimate manner: through the written word. June 1, 2009 Genius abounds Working at the UW, particularly, it's easy to forget how much of the day one spends surrounded by geniuses. March 1, 2009 Just call her a scholar Ellen Dissanayake is working in a field she invented: evolutionary aesthetics, the study of art-making as an innate human behavior that helps us survive. December 1, 2008 Bold moves A pair of stories are a humbling reminder of just how much people will sacrifice for freedom, whether from an oppressive government or an intolerant culture. September 1, 2008 Ramona's world and ours Small wonder we use the same word to describe generosity that we use to describe Beverly Cleary’s imagination: It’s a gift. June 1, 2008 ‘Legend’ has it With this issue, we celebrate the 100th anniversary of the UW's alumni magazine by celebrating the living legends among us. March 1, 2008 Part of the story Luis Sinco doesn’t hold back, whether it’s getting the best picture possible in the middle of a war zone or telling the story of how post-traumatic stress disorder has crushed the life of a 23-year-old former Marine. December 1, 2007 One for the Rhodes DeLaine Emmert, wife of President Mark A. Emmert, '75, asked a simple question: How many Rhodes Scholars does the UW have? No one knew the answer. September 1, 2007 $1 billion for research Word came in August that the University of Washington finally had hit an elusive target—last fiscal year, more than one billion dollars in research funding poured into the University. June 1, 2007 Call and response While the University of Washington is a leader in researching this and other aspects of carbon emissions, it is doing more than just studying this problem. March 1, 2007 Senseless losses To dwell on anger would be to deny the legacies of Mary Cooper and Pamela Waechter, who had devoted their lives to community service and to education. June 1, 2006 Starting over Education is not a manufacturing process. It can seem messy and wasteful, but it also transforms lives. The system forgives false starts and changes in direction. March 1, 2006 Long memory "I don't think the majority of Americans are aware of the internment camps," Ruth Purkaple says. "Some have learned about it in school, but it's still pretty unknown." December 1, 2005 Detective story The assignment was straightforward, but it felt like mission impossible: Find out what happened to more than 400 students forced to leave the University of Washington when the federal government incarcerated Japanese Americans in 1942. September 1, 2005 Trophies pile up We call our awards section “Milestones,” but there is always a problem with that page, even though readers don’t know it. There isn’t enough room to list all the awards—or even to give many details on the achievements listed. June 1, 2005 Magic carpet When Meany Hall opened its doors in 1996, there was plenty of drama in the lobby as well as on stage. The carpet was extraordinarily beautiful. March 1, 2005 Making waves On Dec. 21, UW Bioengineering Professor Henry Lai could be found with a big smile across his face. Research into cell phone radiation that he and N.P. Singh had pioneered 10 years ago at the UW was finally being corroborated. June 1, 2004 High gear Three decades after he said good-bye to his Sprite, Mark Emmert will be taking the wheel of a huge educational enterprise that has hit some potholes recently in its sports program and academic medical center. March 1, 2004 One student at a time With luck and perseverance, I was able to interview 11 of the living UW Rhodes Scholars. December 1, 2003 Paul Allen's gift Paul Allen saw the potential for computers when most of us didn't. September 1, 2003 Rocky marriage The alumni were angry. They had had enough of the rampant commercialism of intercollegiate athletics—especially the salary of the football coach. The time was almost a century ago. June 1, 2003 Gift and grumbling When the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced that it was giving a record $70 million to the University of Washington to further genetic research, everyone on the campus was ecstatic. But on the second floor of Gerberding Hall there was one senior official who felt that his job just got a little harder. March 1, 2003 Too many losses For Columns over the past 18 months, there has been a disturbing trend when obituaries needed to be moved into the news or feature sections of the magazine. December 1, 2002 Golden oldies For the past three months, Associate Editor Jon Marmor and I have been trying to put together our own selection of greatest hits—101 achievements by UW faculty, alumni, staff, students and even the institution itself. September 1, 2002 Why it's named Suzzallo Henry Suzzallo felt that a campus of beauty would enhance the intellectual and moral growth of his students. June 1, 2002 A gift of hope I hate everything about pancreatic cancer, but what I hate the most is its lack of hope. It is a death sentence with no prospect of a pardon. But that may be changing. March 1, 2002 Inspiring sights Asked if they had ever been inspired by a campus view or the quality of a campus space, 96.5 percent of the faculty answered “Yes.” December 1, 2001 Ribbon of hope After tragedies, Columns traces the impact on the University of Washington. September 1, 2001 Bragging rights With four Nobel Prize winners on our faculty, the No. 1 ranking among public universities receiving federal research dollars, and one of the top 15 undergraduate programs among public universities, there is a lot to be proud of. June 1, 2001 'Earthquake Guy' Bill Steele's official title is coordinator of the UW’s Seismology Laboratory, but you’d know him as the “Earthquake Guy.” March 1, 2001 Space force Throughout the history of the space program, our alumni have pushed back the boundaries of the final frontier. June 1, 2000 Here to stay How certain is Richard McCormick that he is here for the long haul? "You can schedule the interview for my 10th anniversary right now as far as I'm concerned." March 1, 2000 Bittersweet taste Tom Stockley, '58, and his wife, Margaret "Peggy" Hodges Stockley, '59, died in the crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261. December 1, 1999 Down to 100 When it came to putting together our last issue of the century, it seemed fitting to run a list of 100 famous, influential or fascinating people. September 1, 1999 Truth is finally told As an editor constantly trying to judge the interests of his audience, my bet is that Columns readers will want to learn about Tom Lantos. March 1, 1999 Trees show their age While the aging trees in the Quad will put on a majestic display, the blossoms can't hide the fact that they won't be around much longer. December 1, 1998 Artist’s eye Art Wolfe's artistry is so powerful, it even captures the attention of a 4-year-old or a 15-year-old. June 1, 1998 Past, present, future Somehow, despite budget cuts, student riots, two world wars, the Great Depression and the Internet, this magazine has survived for 90 years. March 1, 1998 Heated reactions I expected some reaction from our readers. I was not prepared for an onslaught of letters, faxes, e-mails, phone calls and even personal visits as a result of running a piece on the firing of three UW professors during the Red Scare. December 1, 1997 UW remembers Some universities would be happy to forget that the infamous Canwell Committee hearings ever happened, but the University of Washington is not afraid to examine its past. September 1, 1997 Tacoma transformed You could write an epic catalog of the improvements in Tacoma's historic downtown: new brickwork, shining glass windows, atria to bring in daylight, and some new construction harmonious with the old. June 1, 1997 Alumnus Chuck Close shows the art of determination Chuck Close's life is a compelling tale of determination in the face of disability. March 1, 1997 Henry renovation shows the benefits of partnership A public/private partnership between the state, the UW and the Henry Gallery Association produced a $17.5 million renovation. December 1, 1996 When Seattle’s grunge scene exploded, you had to be in the know Many UW students were part of the grunge music scene from its beginning, and the campus radio station KCMU played a crucial role in its formation. September 1, 1996 Mary-Claire King put the pieces together The devastation of watching her best friend die of a kidney tumor triggered Mary-Claire King's unconscious decision to search for a cure. June 1, 1996 1995 bombing highlighted a disturbing rise in anti-government fervor But as the shock waves from the Oklahoma City bombing still echo, we can hope that reasonable discussion will turn down the fever. March 1, 1996 To handle the coming wave of students, we need can-do spirit Today, faced with the echo of that original baby boom, the attitude is all too gloomy. December 1, 1995 There’s another chapter to write about ‘the Ave.’ Alumni have known the Ave. in the best and worst of times. But there is still one more chapter to write. September 1, 1995 Dedication shows in new UW president When we asked Richard McCormick and his family to pose for some pictures to run in Columns, he literally went the extra mile. June 1, 1995 Honoring top teachers When a group of faculty, students and alumni met in 1970 to award the first UW Distinguished Teaching Awards, they planted a seed that has grown into a mighty tree of learning. March 1, 1995 Goodbye, Gerberding William P. Gerberding has put his imprint on the University of Washington as few presidents have. December 1, 1994 Behind the numbers There are plenty of numbers in this issue of Columns—maybe too many.
