It is intended to serve as a complement to a major or concentration. Eligibility for Continuous Enrollment Students must: Be a Columbia College or General Studies student. Take all courses for the Special Concentration in Business Management for a letter grade. Exceptions to this policy: Spring 2020: Given the mandatory Pass/Fail policy across Columbia University for Spring 2020, all courses taken Pass/Fail in Spring 2020 will count toward the Special Concentration prerequisite, core, or elective courses as though they were letter grades. Fall 2020 and onward: Columbia College and General Studies students are able to elect the Pass/D/Fail option for one class this semester without restriction. The course chosen for this grading option can fulfill a prerequisite, core, or elective requirement for the Special Concentration. We will continue to follow the College policy here. Students must earn a minimum GPA of 3.0 in all prerequisite, core, and elective program courses in order to qualify for the special concentration. To be eligible, students must apply to the program in the spring semester of their sophomore or junior years, and they must be accepted through a process governed by Columbia Business School. The program accepts up to 45 qualified candidates each year. The size of the program may be reviewed from time to time by Columbia College and Columbia Business School and adjusted, if desired by both schools. The core courses in the Special Concentration in Business Management cannot be double-counted toward a major or a concentration. Only prerequisites and electives may be double-counted for other majors or concentrations. Please adhere to your major's double-counting policy. In order to graduate, students must complete a major or a full concentration, in addition to the requirements for the Special Concentration in Business Management.

BUSI W3701 Strategy Formulation (3 points) Provides an introduction to strategic management with two broad goals: to understand why some companies are financially much more successful than others; and to analyze how managers can devise a set of actions ("the strategy") and design processes that allow their company to obtain a financial advantage. Allows students to gain a better understanding of strategic issues and begin to master the analytic tools the strategists use, by studying the strategic decisions of companies in many different industries and countries, ranging from U.S. technology firms to a Swiss bank and a Chinese white goods manufacturer. Topics include what companies can do to outperform their rivals; analysis of the competitive moves of rival firms relying heavily on game-theoretic concepts; and when it makes sense for companies to diversify and globalize their business. BUSI UN3703 Leadership in Organizations (3 points) This course aims to provide students with an understanding of the challenges confronting leaders and to develop skills to effectively deal with these obstacles. Beyond intelligence and technical know-how, what separates effective leaders from other team members is a set of social skills (e.g., impression management, self-awareness). This course identifies these critical leadership skills and provides ideas and tools for improving them. Then, the course considers how social intelligence skills fit the needs of managers at different stages of their careers. For example, in the early stages of their careers, managers need to achieve a good job fit, find mentors, and build an effective social network. At the mid-career stage, managers need to lead an effective unit with increasing complexity and responsibilities. And later in their careers, as they become partners, CFOs, CEOs, etc., managers face additional, unique challenges.
