Selection of Graduate Associates is highly competitive and offered in a variety of fields. Applicants in Church Music, Collaborative Piano, Composition, Conducting, Instrumental Performance, Musicology, Music Theory, Organ Performance, Piano Performance, Piano Pedagogy, and Vocal Performance will be considered for Graduate Associate positions. Graduate Associate positions are not awarded by the School of Music to MDiv/MM in Church Music students because they receive funding through Truett Seminary. Graduate Associate positions are awarded to begin in the Fall semester, so if a Graduate Associate position is needed to be able to study in the graduate music program at Baylor, please apply to begin in the Fall semester. There are no new awards available for those wanting to begin graduate study during the Spring semester. Graduate Associate positions include a full tuition scholarship for all required graduate coursework plus a stipend for working twelve hours per week in the School of Music. To be considered for a Graduate Associate position students must: Apply to, be accepted, and be admitted to the School of Music Apply to, be accepted, and be admitted to the Graduate School Submit a C.V. or résumé as part of their Graduate School application materials The music faculty recommends that you include any teaching and/or applicable work experience on your C.V. or résumé. Graduate Associate positions are awarded based on the recommendation of the faculty in the student's major area. Decisions typically begin to be made about April 1 (March 15 for Conducting positions) and may take up to two months to complete. Candidates will be notified of their status as soon as possible after this has been determined. Students who are awarded Graduate Associate positions will be asked to sign and return a contract. The Associate Dean for Graduate Studies of the School of Music will make the official notice of Graduate Associate awards in writing. Any discussion of Graduate Associate awards or assignments prior to that notice, or by any other persons, shall be considered preliminary and unofficial. Graduate Associate positions are typically awarded one year at a time. For new students, the expectation is that the contract will be renewed for a second year. This renewal depends principally upon the student maintaining good overall academic standing, making adequate progress in the degree major, and performing the assigned duties satisfactorily. The duties of Graduate Associates will vary depending upon the requirements of the area in which the position is awarded. Responsibilities may include classroom or private teaching of non-majors, tutoring, classroom or general assistance for faculty, accompanying, grading, staffing labs, office or recording studio work, etc. In addition to Graduate Associate positions, a limited number of Graduate Tuition Awards may be available to highly qualified candidates in areas without an open assistantship position. Graduate Tuition Awards include a full tuition scholarship for all required graduate coursework, yet do not include a stipend or work duties. Graduate Tuition Awards are typically granted one year at a time. For new students, the expectation is that the scholarship will be renewed for a second year. This renewal depends principally upon the student maintaining good overall academic standing and making adequate progress in the degree major. Students must maintain a Grade Point Average of at least 3.0 to retain graduate assistantships or scholarships awarded through the Graduate School. Only students with full graduate standing may be considered for assistantships. A student on probation is not entitled to apply for assistance or to continue receiving any financial aid awarded prior to the deficiency. For information on the Council of Graduate Schools' Resolution regarding deadlines for acceptance of financial offers by Graduate Scholars, Fellows, Trainees, and Assistants, see the following link: https://cgsnet.org/april-15-resolution. Cost of Attendance Benefits & Financial Support Financial Aid To be considered for all possible scholarship and financial aid opportunities, U.S. citizen graduate students must complete the following application. You may complete it before you get accepted or audition (the earlier you complete this application, the better). We recommend completing before February 1 for those wanting to begin school in the Fall. We HIGHLY recommend U.S. citizens complete the FAFSA (Baylor school code = 003545): Incoming graduate students can apply for financial aid including loans, grants, and scholarships for the upcoming academic year as soon as possible beginning October 1 at fafsa.gov. Student Financial Services Student Employment Baylor University maintains a student financial aid program including scholarships, grants, on-campus employment, and loans totaling approximately $60 million dollars annually. 92% of Baylor students receive financial aid.
