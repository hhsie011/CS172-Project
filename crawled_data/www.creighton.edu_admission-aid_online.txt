And it seemed like a rigorous course too, and a demanding course, which I really felt was an important aspect.” — Gen. Anthony Zinni (Ret. U.S. Marine Corps), Negotiation and Conflict Resolution (MS) “Between the excellent videos, slides and other supplemental materials provided for the curriculum, and the ease with which I was able to email and call my professors for help and or discussion questions, it really felt like they were not that far away.” — Tanya Wilson, Investment Management and Financial Analysis (Master’s) “With the video lectures, I could speed them up or slow them down.
