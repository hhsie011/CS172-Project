Undergraduate Minor The undergraduate minor in Latin American Studies is earned by completing the following requirements: Language Proficiency in Spanish or Portuguese can be demonstrated in one of two ways: 1. By passing a Romance Studies Department language proficiency test at a Q++ level (language proficiency tests are only available at the beginning of each semester, please plan accordingly). OR 2. Successfully completing SPAN 2095 (or one Spanish course at a higher level if you placement tested out of 2095) or PORT 2010 or PORT 2020 language course (FLAC courses count towards the 15 elective credits below but not the minor's language requirement). Elective Courses In addition to the language requirement, minor candidates must complete a minimum of 15 credits in approved Latin American Studies elective courses (listed as LATA in the Cornell course catalog). Students must earn a B or higher in these courses. Selected courses must represent at least two different departments. Students must complete at least one advanced level course in Latin American studies (3000-4000 level). We don't require, but highly recommend, at least one semester of participation in the LACS Seminar Series course LATA 4000, this counts towards completing elective course requirement #2 above. If you would like to petition for a course or a study abroad semester to count towards the minor, please contact LACS or come into the office at 190 Uris Hall. Language and Elective Course list Graduate Minor The graduate minor in Latin American Studies is earned by completing the following requirements: Selecting a member of the graduate field in Latin American studies to serve on your special committee.
