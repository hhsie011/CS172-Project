Academies Graduate School Academies are non-credit-bearing short courses designed to help graduate students develop knowledge, skills, and experiences that complement their academic coursework. Led by experts, interdisciplinary in nature, and flexible in format, academies share foundational concepts while allowing students to immediately apply their learning. Selected graduate students who complete the academies have tangible deliverables, marketable skills, and language to communicate their learning. Workshops The Graduate School leads and hosts between 20-60 in-person and remote workshops in any given year, to support graduate students' transition into graduate school, through their graduate education, and as they move to the next stage in their lives and careers. Graduate students who participate in six or more workshops in a given year are recognized at the Annual Graduate Student Dean's Reception. Additionally, graduate students will soon be able to select areas of focus to complete a more in-depth learning experience. Events The Graduate School hosts a number of special events for graduate students, from the International Three Minute Thesis (TM) Competition, to Women's Panels, Graduate Student Appreciation Week, the Celebration of Excellence in Diversity, and more. Mentoring Effective mentoring is both a needed experience for graduate students and an important skill to develop, no matter your career path. The Graduate School supports a number of mentoring efforts, including a Mentoring Academy, Research Mentoring Award Grant, the MentorCenter Online Resource Center, and programming to support quality mentoring efforts in individual programs.
