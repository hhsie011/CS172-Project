I am so grateful to have found Well-Being Coaching — I have felt so heard and understood and empowered to take action with the things in my life that I'm struggling with. Amazing service, I would recommend it to any and every student. My nutritionist helped me to embrace always eating the proper quantity of food, and allowing myself to “indulge” in moderation, without attached guilt. My coach has been a huge help to me to navigate a very hard time changing advisors. I had to restart my PhD after 2.5 years of working in a toxic environment. Coaching helped me to identify what was valuable to keep from my previous experience and how to recover from the issues that remained from that previous episode and flourish in my second chance.
