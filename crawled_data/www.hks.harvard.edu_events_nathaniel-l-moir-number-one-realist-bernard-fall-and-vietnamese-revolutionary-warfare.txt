Its members—distinguished historians and public servants—study the past to illuminate the most pressing challenges we face today. For this session, the Applied History Working Group is delighted to welcome Nathaniel L. Moir, Associate of the Belfer Center's Applied History Project. Moir, in conversation with Fredrik Logevall (Laurence D. Belfer Professor of International Affairs and author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning volume on Vietnam Embers of War), will discuss his new book Number One Realist: Bernard Fall and Vietnamese Revolutionary Warfare, which blends history and biography to challenge the traditional mode of thinking about the Vietnam War.
