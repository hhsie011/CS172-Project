Irvine Auditorium also houses an acoustic recital hall, four additional special event spaces, production offices, a box office, coatroom, dressing rooms, and music practice rooms. The entire facility is air-conditioned and equipped with state-of-the-art technology including a digital satellite computer/video projector, internet access and a house intercom system. The building is only open to the public when an event is taking place in the building.
