Faithful to our traditions, we will hold the elections along with the annual general assembly and our club’s vasilopita. The event will take place in person at the Art Lounge of the top floor of New Hotel, indoors but with open windows and we will follow all covid-related official recommendations. We encourage alumni who wish to engage in a volunteering role for our Alma Mater to run during these elections, especially those who have not done so up until now.
