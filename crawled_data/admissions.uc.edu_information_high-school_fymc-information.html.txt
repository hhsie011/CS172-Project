Campuses The University of Cincinnati is comprised of three campuses that offer different programs and opportunities.

Additionally, students need to apply by the Early Action deadline to be considered for The University Honors Program and merit-based scholarships. There is not a separate application for either of these. Electronic materials must be uploaded and any associated fees submitted by 11:59 p.m. on December 1. Mailed materials must be postmarked on or before December 1. As long as all materials, whether electronic or mailed meet these time constraints and complete the student’s application packet, the application will be considered on time. Any applications that are incomplete or are submitted December 2 or later will be evaluated for admission to eligble programs but will not be considered for competitive academic programs that have closed, scholarships, or the university honors program. The following programs often receive more applicants than they have room to consider. Historically, these programs close on or shortly after the December 1 deadline. It is recommended that students applying to the following colleges apply via Early Action (applications received after December 1 for these programs will be considered on a space-available basis): College-Conservatory of Music College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning College of Engineering & Applied Sciences College of Medicine College of Nursing Lindner College of Business *Applicants to any major within CCM will be encouraged to submit pre-screening materials by November 15. For more CCM application information visit ccm.uc.edu/admissions. Application Review Process Admission to the University of Cincinnati is selective. First-year applications receive a comprehensive review in which both academic and non-academic factors are considered in determining admissibility to our academic programs. Admission Decision Timeline Regardless of major, Cincinnati reviews all applicants who have met the December 1 Early Action deadline prior to releasing admissions decisions. Early Action applicants can expect to learn their admission decision on Cincinnati Decision Day which is typically in mid-January or early February. Note the following exceptions: Applicants for the College-Conservatory of Music must audition and will learn of their admission decision in March. For students who complete an application after December 1, admission decisions will be released on a weekly basis starting in early February. Rolling Deadline For students who complete an application after December 1, admission decisions will be released on a rolling basis after Cincinnati Decision Day. Student Application Portal Students can log into their status page to check that application materials are in and view their decision.
