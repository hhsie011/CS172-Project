The primary objectives of My Voice, My Story are to utilize the power of narrative to achieve greater understanding of the lived experiences of graduate and professional students, share stories that frequently go untold, and develop strategies on how to create more inclusive and supportive research and learning environments. Listening to the stories of the characters portrayed in the My Voice, My Story monologues provides participants with opportunities for learning through: Listening for understanding, especially when we think we are different from one another. Understanding intent versus impact and the possible implications when the two don’t align. Developing awareness and understanding of experiences of exclusion and inclusion in the learning and research environment. Establishing respect for our mutual similarities and differences. Experiencing empathy for and identification with all of the characters portrayed in the video monologues. Seeing the commonality of our human experience that flows underneath all the stories. Recognizing instances of implicit bias. Contributing to the development of strategies on how one can contribute to improving the organizational climate for all its members. How long is a My Voice, My Story Session? 120 minutes: 20 minutes for introductions, opening, and content delivery; 20 minutes for videos; 70 minutes for facilitated dialogue; 10 minutes for closing Focus Audiences Graduate and professional students Faculty Staff who work with graduate and professional students Strategies for Successful My Voice, My Story (MVMS) Sessions Limit the audience size to no more than 32 participants, and no less than 12 participants. Work in advance with the MVMS facilitation team to schedule and plan the delivery of a MVMS session either via Zoom or in-person (all in-person sessions are on hold until further notice due to COVID-19). For in person sessions, schedule the session during a time of day when a meal can be provided as well. For in person sessions, utilize a room with a set up that will help support easy engagement in large and small group discussions; avoid rooms with fixed sitting such as auditoriums. For student sessions, partner with at least one other graduate field to allow for a more blended audience as it relates to academic and research experiences as well as to the demographic composition of the group. Consider how MVMS sessions could become part of the regular cycle of professional development programming for specific audiences within your graduate field, department, or college. Explore with the facilitation team how individual monologues from MVMS can be used in place of case studies for other programs such as mentor training. Share this article on how MVMS is using the power of stories to advance inclusion.
