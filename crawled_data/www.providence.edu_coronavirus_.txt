Of course, it is important to temper that optimism with the realization that the situation will continue to be challenging for some time to come, and we all will need to be vigilant and flexible. As conditions change the College will continue to adjust its policies and practices, but the guiding principle will remain the same as it has been since the beginning of the pandemic: the health and safety of all members of our community takes priority. Public health guidance has provided the foundation for PC’s spring semester planning, and the College will continue to rely on the Centers for Disease Control and Rhode Island Department of Health to provide the necessary information allowing us to make informed decisions as pandemic conditions evolve. The people of Providence College have shown great resiliency and compassion over these past many months, and we know that will continue. The 2021-2022 academic year is characterized by high hopes and confidence that all in our community will continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder, committed to the institution’s core values and its focus on student well-being and academic achievement.
