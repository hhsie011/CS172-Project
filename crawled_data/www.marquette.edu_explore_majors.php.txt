You're not alone. In fact, "undecided" is our most popular major. We've found over time, however, that few students are truly undecided. That's why we prefer to say "multi-interested." With nearly 80 majors at Marquette, we'll help you to choose a major or minor combination that matches your interests and skills. We think you'll find that a liberal arts education will not only prepare you for meaningful work, but for a purposeful life as well. Learn more. Marquette Core curriculum Fundamental to every student's course of study, the Marquette Core Curriculum (MCC) exemplifies the transformative aspects of Jesuit education.
