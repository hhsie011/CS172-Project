A Chance to Win! June 23, 2021 Dear Colleagues: To all Columbia affiliates who have already uploaded your vaccine information, thank you. For those who have not yet done so, you have six weeks until the Aug. 2 deadline. Help us to avoid a last-minute scramble and, better yet, celebrate the summer with a little something extra by uploading now. Anyone who has already submitted their vaccine information or completed an application for an exemption, or who does so by the end of this week (Sunday, June 27), is eligible for our vaccine contest. Five winners will be selected via a random drawing for three cash prizes of $500 each (taxable) or two Columbia-themed swag bags valued at over $200 each. Winners will be notified next week. Don’t delay. If you haven’t already submitted your vaccination information, all you have to do to be eligible for the prizes is open this page and follow the uploading steps: https://covid19.columbia.edu/content/vaccine-documentation-upload-instructions. But do it before Sunday at midnight. Preferably right now! Thank you, Gerry Rosberg Senior Executive Vice President Donna Lynne Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, CUIMC University COVID Director Tags Announcement Public Health Vaccine News May 05, 2022 Update on Current Public Health Protocols April 25, 2022 COVID-19 Treatment Option for Individuals Meeting CDC Guidelines April 22, 2022 Statement From the President’s Advisory Task Force on COVID-19 April 15, 2022 Update on Vaccination Requirement for Students April 15, 2022 Three Updates: Booster Shots, Gateway Testing, and Masking Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
