Our office works at the intersection of the economy, the environment and social justice, advocating for climate action, waste minimization, sustainability education, and resource stewardship on behalf of the planet and its people. It is important to us that we continuously strive toward intersectional environmentalism - that is, an inclusive version of environmentalism that advocates for both the protection of people and the planet. Intersectional environmentalism challenges us to identify ways in which injustices happening to marginalized communities and the earth are interconnected. In doing so, we work toward building a culture of environmental justice at FSU and beyond. Environmental Justice The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines environmental justice as the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income, with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. We recognize that sustainability is not separate from racial justice. The two are intertwined as many BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) communities are affected by higher rates of environmental harms or environmental racism. A more sustainable society must necessarily be a more just society. This is why we strive to advance equity and justice for marginalized communities in the sustainability movement and our global society. We invite our campus community to join us in learning more about intersectional environmentalism and environmental justice and take action toward ensuring access to clean water, air, soil, and food for everyone.

The course is designed to help us reframe our definition and perspective of sustainability and center the “people” sphere to better integrate social justice into all sustainability efforts. During the session, we review and discuss a series of case studies that highlight the overlapping nature of environmental and social justice. We also shed light on how these movements interact and influence each other and lay the groundwork for stronger connections and collaboration between allies. Learn more . . . Sustainability Trainings » TAKE ACTION: ANTI-RACISM RESOURCES FROM FSU AND BEYOND The Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Office within Human Resources provides anti-racism resources including books and articles, resources for kids, online resources like blogs, social media accounts, YouTube channels, and TED Talks, and videos.

Understanding Systemic Racism Diversity & Inclusion at FSU As detailed in the Strategic Plan our approach starts with a belief that diversity is about more than a particular head count: it must reflect the quality and depths of interactions. With programs like Unconquered scholars, FSU is redefining what inclusion can mean on college campuses- which has led to our being named one of only 10 “Diversity Champion” universities nationally recognized by INSIGHT Into Diversity Magazine. By valuing, celebrating and leveraging the differences and similarities within our community, we create a fertile environment for problem-solving- one that is more inventive and compassionate.
