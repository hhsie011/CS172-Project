Through lectures, conferences, seminars, and workshops, scholars present their work, elicit critical responses, and stimulate public awareness and debate about the humanities. The goal of the Center is to provide mutual understanding among groups and cultures, provide support for research in the humanities, and enrich the intellectual culture of the University and community.
