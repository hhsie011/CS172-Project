The initiative encourages women and girls to make their health a priority. The CDC has found that women make up two out of three caregivers in the United States. This means women who are caregivers provide daily or regular support to children, adults, or those with chronic illnesses or disabilities. Women who have a role as a caregiver are at a greater risk of developing poor physical and mental health. To reduce this risk, women can practice preventive care. Preventive care can minimize the risk of chronic diseases and help detect any issues early so that a treatment plan can be made. Yoga is a great way to be physically activate and manage stress. Clemson Extension Rural Health and Nutrition Team Ways to Make Your Health a Priority 1. Talk with your Health Care Team It is essential to schedule regular check-ups. Writing down any questions you may have and taking them to your appointments can help you have a guided conversation with your doctor.
