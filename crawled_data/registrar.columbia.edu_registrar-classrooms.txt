Newly Built or Renovated Classroom Policy June, 2019 This policy governs the management and space assignment of all classrooms except those at CUIMC. All classrooms currently in general use for academic instruction are assigned to the University Registrar who is fully responsible for the scheduling of courses and other course-related events in these rooms. Dedicated or sequestered classrooms that are vacated for any reason will be transferred to the Registrar for space assignment and scheduling of courses. All new classrooms constructed on campus or renovated will be managed by the Registrar regardless of the project funding source.
