Nine credits (three courses) in the area of ancient civilization and culture (readings in English). Recommended in particular are Classical Mythology and the sequences in Greek and The City of Rome or Greek and Roman History. Twelve credits (four courses) consisting of any course the department offers, except for elementary Latin (CLAS 1010/1011) and modern Greek (CLAS 1060/1061, 1070/1071). Note: A student may, with departmental permission, substitute one advanced reading course in Latin or Greek for one of the required courses in ancient civilization and culture. Elementary Ancient Greek can count towards the major but elementary Latin may not. Placement Incoming students should seek departmental advice on placement in language courses. If you have studied Latin in high school, it may, depending on the extent of your preparation, be appropriate to start college either at the intermediate, advanced intermediate, or advanced level. The right choice is highly individual. If you want to study both Latin and Greek, it is advisable to begin Greek no later than the second year, presuming that you already have some Latin. Course Availability Courses at the intermediate level in Latin and Greek are taught every semester. At the advanced level two courses in Latin authors and one course in a Greek author are typically offered each term. These can sometimes be supplemented by independent projects, depending on faculty availability to supervise them. In the area of civilization courses, i.e., those whose reading is in English translation, four or five are usually taught each term.
