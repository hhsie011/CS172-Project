Through the first-year writing courses, the College offers entering students a valuable opportunity to develop the thinking and writing abilities that characterize intellectual work in the academy and in educated public discourse. On June 1, all entering students will receive notification about the directed self-placement process, a process that all students must complete to choose among the various writing courses that fulfill the first-year writing requirement (see below). You may now access the directed-self placement process for first-year writing here: Writing Placement - Class of 2026 Choosing Your Writing Course: Directed Self-Placement Dartmouth uses an online process called Directed Self-Placement (DSP) to help you choose your first-year writing courses. You will receive more information about this process in June and will have three weeks to answer a questionnaire, read a few articles, and compose an essay. Based on your submission, our faculty will make a recommendation that will help you with a final decision about which writing course to take. The purpose of this process is to help you understand the difference among the writing courses, reflect on your writing experiences and abilities, and make a thoughtful choice about which of these writing courses might be best for you. Important Deadlines for Directed Self-Placement: The online placement site will become available June 1. The deadline to submit information through the placement site is June 22. Your recommended placement will be sent to you via email on July 15. The deadline to request a different placement is July 23. More information can be found here: FAQ Directed Self-Placement Process for Writing First-year Writing Course Choices The first-year writing requirement at Dartmouth is satisfied by taking any of the following courses: Writing 5 Writing 2-3 Humanities 1 For further information on the differences between these courses, please see Differences among the First-Year Writing Courses.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Institute for Writing and Rhetoric Philosophy & Aims About Writing at Dartmouth Speech at Dartmouth Our Stories The Story of Writing Instruction at Dartmouth The Story of Speech at Dartmouth The Story of Writing Support at Dartmouth Curriculum Overview Writing Courses Writing 2-3 WRIT 5 First-Year Seminars Humanities 1-2 Speech Courses Speech 20 Speech 25 Speech 26 Speech 27 Speech 30 Speech 31 Speech 33 Speech 34 Speech 36 Speech 37 Speech 40 Placement and Enrollment Policies First-Year Writing & First-Year Seminar Requirements Differences Among First-Year Writing Courses FAQ Directed Self-Placement Process for Writing Registration for Writing 5 or Writing 2-3 Registration for First Year Seminars FAQ First-year Writing Registration First-year Writing Choices Prizes Writing Prize Winners Speech Contest Winners Speech Contest Call for Entries Learning Overview Writing Center Make an Appointment Materials Sources and Citations at Dartmouth Teaching Overview Guidelines Teaching Writing in the First Year Expectations for Writing 2-3 Expectations for Writing 5 Teaching the First-Year Seminar First-Year Writing: Pedagogies, Methods, & Design Active Learning in the First-Year Writing Classroom Syllabus and Assignment Design Teaching Writing as Process Integrating Reading and Writing Diagnosing and Responding to Student Writing Conducting Writing Workshops Collaborative Learning/Learning with Peers Teaching Argument Teaching Research Addressing Grammar Useful links Support The Writing Assistant Program Research Past Research Activities Research Overview Multilingual Overview Support for Undergraduate Students Support for Graduate Students Faculty Support News & People People News Employment Upcoming Events Past Events My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
