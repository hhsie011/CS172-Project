Biologists will be concerned with pollution of the environment, cause and cure of disease, population control, recurring food shortages, preservation of species and many other aspects resulting from the impact of technological changes on life forms. Those who are astounded by the array of living things on the earth and who seek challenging, creative work should consider a career in biology or in a biology-related field. The Department of Biology offers six distinct four-year curricula which lead to the baccalaureate degree. These are the Bachelor of Arts in Biology, Bachelor of Science in Biology, Bachelor of Science in Molecular and Cell Biology, Bachelor of Science in Microbiology, Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience (Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience Track), and Bachelor of Science in Zoology. The curricula are designed to maximize postbaccalaureate opportunities in: professional schools of medicine, veterinary medicine and dentistry; allied health schools of physical and occupational therapy, physician assistant programs, optometry, pharmacy, and nursing; graduate education leading to teaching and research careers in universities, in industry or in state or national agencies; teaching at junior high or high school levels and jobs in biotechnology, research laboratories, pharmaceutical companies and field biology. The Department of Biology degree plans will enable students to complete all entrance requirements for graduate and professional schools as well as medical technology, pharmacy, optometry, nursing, physical therapy, and other paramedical and health support fields. Advising Because some careers in biology require advanced and/or specialized training, it is essential to take advantage of advising opportunities. In the Department of Biology, there are professional advisors in the Biology Undergraduate Programs Office. The advisor may be consulted prior to each registration period and as the student needs. Questions regarding registration, degree checks, transfer of courses, advanced placements and other academic matters are handled in the Office of Undergraduate Programs. Students with special interests in graduate study should consult the graduate advisor. Information concerning entrance to professional schools of medicine, dentistry and other health related fields is available from the Office of Professional School Advising. Requirements for all Baccalaureate Degrees in the Department of Biology Each student seeking a baccalaureate degree in the Department of Biology is required to master a common body of knowledge in science. In addition, the student must take courses essential to a liberal education. Students will note that the first two years of all curricula offered by the Department of Biology are similar. Electives must include a 3 hour international and cultural diversity elective and a 3 hour cultural discourse elective required for graduation. Students must also take at least two writing-intensive courses in biology. Other requirements for graduation are listed in the Texas A&M University Student Rules and this catalog. Students in the Department of Biology must make a grade of C or better in BIOL 111 and BIOL 112. Additionally, students may have only one D in courses within the major used to satisfy required or directed electives for a given degree plan. It is required that the freshman and sophomore level biology, chemistry and math courses be completed before the start of the 5th full semester and before enrollment in any junior or senior level science. Common Body of Knowledge To assure that students have sufficient prerequisite training for advanced courses, Biology majors must complete a series of courses comprising a Common Body of Knowledge (CBK) prior to their junior year (5th full semester) and enrollment in upper level BIOL courses. A Biology student will be admitted into upper level Biology classes when he or she has met the following criteria: Completion of a set of CBK courses (37-38 hours) before the student's 5th full semester to include: Course List Code Title Semester Credit Hours BIOL 111 Introductory Biology I 4 BIOL 112 Introductory Biology II 4 BIOL 213 Molecular Cell Biology 3 BIOL 214 Genes, Ecology and Evolution 3 CHEM 119 Fundamentals of Chemistry I 4 CHEM 120 Fundamentals of Chemistry II 4 CHEM 227 & CHEM 237 Organic Chemistry I and Organic Chemistry Laboratory 4 CHEM 228 & CHEM 238 Organic Chemistry II and Organic Chemistry Laboratory 4 Select one of the following: 4 MATH 147 Calculus I for Biological Sciences MATH 151 Engineering Mathematics I MATH 171 Calculus I Select one of the following: 3-4 MATH 148 Calculus II for Biological Sciences MATH 152 Engineering Mathematics II MATH 172 Calculus II STAT 201 Elementary Statistical Inference Total Semester Credit Hours 37-38 A student must be in good academic standing with an overall grade point average of a 2.0 or better overall and in the major. Process Students will be audited by the department to monitor progress of the CBK. Students failing to complete the CBK within the first four full semesters (two full semesters for Transfer Students) at Texas A&M University may be blocked and forced to change majors or be required to meet with an academic advisor to see if they can be successful in the major. Students registering for upper-level Biology classes without completing the CBK, or without approval of the Undergraduate Advising Office, will be dropped from the roster. Transfer Students Transfer from within Texas A&M University: The Biology Department will accept changes of major from other departments at Texas A&M upon completion of AT LEAST one semester of an applicable BIOL course taken at Texas A&M and AT LEAST one semester of an applicable CHEM course taken at Texas A&M, with a minimum 2.5 grade point average overall for courses taken at Texas A&M, a 2.5 grade point average in BIOL courses taken at Texas A&M, and a 2.5 or better grade point average in CHEM courses taken at Texas A&M.
