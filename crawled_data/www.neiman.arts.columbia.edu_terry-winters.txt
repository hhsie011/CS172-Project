Winters’s rough hewn drawings are paired and, at times, obscured by Marcus’s text which has been typed on colored grounds reminiscent of Post-it notes. Evidence of their working collaboration and process has been left behind in the final edition, including revisions to Marcus’s text - a story about a mysterious traveller - and Winters’s drawings which appear as handwritten notes and marginalia. Marcus sent Winters only parts of his story at a time, allowing the artist to read and respond to it in a non-linear way. Terry Winters (b. 1949) received a BFA from the Pratt Institute in 1971. In addition to his painting and drawing practice, Winters is an accomplished and prolific printmaker, receiving a mid-career retrospective of his graphic work at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2001. His subject matter is fueled in part by an interest in organic processes as well as architecture, industrial design and technological systems. Winters’s work has been included in a number of Whitney Biennials (1985, 1987 and 1995) and the focus of solo exhibitions at the Tate Gallery, London and the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, DC. His work is in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, NY; Tate Gallery, London; the List Visual Art Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth and the Broad Art Foundation among others. His complete print archive resides in the collection of the Colby College Museum of Art. Winters lives and works in New York and Geneva, Switzerland. Ben Marcus is the chair of the writing division in the School of the Arts at Columbia University. He received a BA from New York University and a MFA from Brown University. Marcus is the author of three books of fiction: Notable American Women, The Father Costume, and The Age of Wire and String. He edited the anthology, The Anchor Book of New American Short Stories, published in 2004. He has received a National Endowment for the Arts Award, three Pushcart Prizes, a fellowship from the Howard Foundation, and a Whiting Writers Award, among others. He has taught at Brown, Old Dominion University, the University of Texas at Austin, and Lehman College, CUNY.
