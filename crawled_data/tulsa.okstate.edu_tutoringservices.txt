Tutoring Services Virtual Writing Tutorials The Learning Services Center continues to offer writing tutorials during the spring semester. Students seeking assistance with their writing can email their assignment to tulsa.lsc@okstate.edu. Be sure to attach your assignment and any other relevant information (assignment sheet, rubric, etc.). You may also include specific areas of concern for the tutor’s attention. A writing consultant will review your work, make comments, and return your document within 24 hours. Please feel free to submit during any stage of the writing process. Additionally, students can use the same service for quick questions-grammar, documentation, word usage, etc. We hope this service can help students who need brief assistance receive useful feedback. Please note that we do not provide a proofreading service, but we strive to provide feedback aimed at improvement. Call 918-594-8232 or email tulsa.lsc@okstate.edu with any questions.
