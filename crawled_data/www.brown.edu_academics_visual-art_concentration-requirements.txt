In addition to studio courses, courses in Art History and a Visiting Artist Lecture Series help to find artistic direction and hone skills in critical thinking. Students must file their concentration declaration by the end of their 5th semester. This is done on-line via Brown's advising website, ASK. Once a student's concentration is declared, they are paired with a regular VA faculty member who will be their Concentration Advisor.
