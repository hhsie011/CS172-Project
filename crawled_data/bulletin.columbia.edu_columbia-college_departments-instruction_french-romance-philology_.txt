Both the major and concentration provide students with an overview of French and Francophone literature, culture, and history from the Middle Ages to the present. Major in French and Francophone Studies The major in French and Francophone studies provides an interdisciplinary framework for the study of the history, literature, and culture of France and parts of the world in which French is an important medium of culture. Students explore the history and contemporary applications of concepts such as citizenship, national unity, secularism, and human rights, and explore central issues including universalism/relativism, tradition/modernity, and religion/state as they have developed in France and its colonies/former colonies since the 18th century. Students take a series of required courses that includes: FREN UN3405 ADVANCED GRAMMAR AND COMPOSITION; FREN UN3409 INTRO TO FRENCH AND FRANCOPHONE HISTORY; FREN UN3410 INTRO TO FRENCH AND FRANCOPHONE LITERATURE; FREN UN3995 SENIOR SEMINAR. Students also take advanced electives (at the 3000 or 4000 level) on French and francophone literature, culture, and history. A senior thesis is optional but encouraged. In Fulfillment of the Language Requirement Students beginning the study of French at Columbia must take four terms of the following two-year sequence: Entering students are placed, or exempted, on the basis of their College Board Achievement or Advanced Placement scores, or their scores on the placement test administered by the Center for Student Advising, 403 Lerner. An SAT score of 780 or a score of 5 on the AP exam satisfies the language requirement. Students with a score of 4 on the AP exam will be placed in Intermediate II, but may attempt to place out by requesting to take an oral exam administered by the Director of the Language Program. Please note: The Barnard course, FREN BC1204 Intermediate II does not fulfill the undergraduate language requirement. Language Proficiency Courses Elementary and intermediate French courses help students develop an active command of the language. In FREN UN1101 Elementary French I and FREN UN1102 Elementary French II, the communicative approach is the main instructional method. In addition to practicing all four language skills—listening, speaking, reading, and writing—students are introduced to the cultural features of diverse French-speaking communities. In intermediate courses FREN UN2101 INTERMEDIATE FRENCH I and FREN UN2102 Intermediate Course II, students develop linguistic competence through the study of short stories, films, novels, and plays. After completing the four-semester language sequence, students can discuss and write in fairly proficient French on complex topics. At the third-year level, attention is focused on more sophisticated use of language, in grammar and composition courses, and on literary, historical, and philosophical questions. Conversation Courses Students looking for intensive French oral practice may take some of the 2-point conversation courses offered at intermediate and advanced levels. Conversation courses generally may not be counted toward the major or concentration. Advanced Placement AP score of 4 automatically places a student in French Intermediate II, thereby granting them the equivalency of the first 3 courses of the elementary-intermediate sequence. AP score of 5 or DELF: The department grants 3 credits for a score of 5 on the AP French Language exam, or for the completion of DELF (Diplôme d'Etudes en Langue Française). Students are awarded this credit only after they take a 3000-level French course (taught in French, for at least 3 points) and obtain a grade of B or above in that course. DALF C1 level or IB HL score of 6 or 7: The department grants 3 credits for the C1 level of DALF (Diplôme Approfondi de Langue Française), or for a score of 6 or 7 on the International Baccalaureate (IB) Higher Level (HL) exam. Students have no obligation to take higher-level French courses in order to receive these 3 credits, but restrictions apply on the use of these credits toward the French major. Language Laboratory and On-line Materials Language laboratories located in the International Affairs Building provide opportunities for intensive practice in French pronunciation and aural comprehension. French courses typically make extensive use of on-line interactive materials that students can access from their own computers. Maison Française Students interested in French should acquaint themselves with the Maison Française, which houses a reading room of French newspapers, periodicals, books, and videos, and sponsors lectures/discussions and aby distinguished French visitors to New York City. With its weekly French film series as well as, book club, café-conversation. Another opportunity to practice French, discover new aspects of Francophone culture, and learn about internships and professional opportunities is the French Cultural Society. For information about the FCS, contact the departmental liaison, Dr. Laurence Marie. and other events, the Maison Française offers an excellent opportunity for students to perfect their language skills and enhance their knowledge of French and Francophone culture. Study Abroad Because a direct experience of contemporary French society is an important essential part of the program, majors and concentrators are strongly encouraged to spend either a semester or a year at Reid Hall-Columbia University in Paris, or at another French or Francophone university. During their time abroad, students take courses credited toward the major and, in some cases, also toward other majors (e.g. history, art history, political science) and the global core. For information on study abroad, visit the OGP website at www.ogp.columbia.edu, call 212-854-2559, or e-mail studyabroad@columbia.edu. For a list of approved study abroad programs, visit http://www.ogp.columbia.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ListAll. Summer Study in Paris Study abroad opportunities at Reid Hall are also available during the summer. These include language and culture courses, global core electives and a combined course that meets both Columbia’s ArtHum and MusicHum requirements. For information about study abroad, visit https://global.undergrad.columbia.edu/studyabroad. Grading Students who wish to use toward the major or concentration a course in which a grade of D has been received must consult with the director of undergraduate studies. Departmental Honors Majors who wish to be considered for departmental honors should consult with the director of undergraduate studies. To be eligible for departmental honorse, students must have a grade point average of at least 3.7 in major courses and have completed an approved senior thesis under the guidance of a faculty member at Columbia or Reid Hall. Normally no more than 10% of graduating majors receive departmental honors in a given academic year.

Prerequisites: FREN UN3405 must be taken before FREN UN3333/4 unless the student has an AP score of 5 or the director of undergraduate studies permission. The goal of FREN UN3405 is to help students improve their grammar and perfect their writing and reading skills, especially as a preparation for taking literature or civilization courses, or spending a semester in a francophone country. Through the study of two full-length works of literature and a number of short texts representative of different genres, periods, and styles, they will become more aware of stylistic nuances, and will be introduced to the vocabulary and methods of literary analysis.

Prerequisites: 2 years of college French Prerequisites: 2 years of college French Paris may be referred to as the capital of modernity, as the city of romance and pleasure, as the center of social and political powers, or as a privileged stage for crises and revolutions. Analyzing and researching the meanings of these diverse representations would expose students to key aspects of French and Francophone political, social, and cultural history. This is a proposal for a course intended for students who, having completed their language requirement in French, would like to better their knowledge of French language and society. It would offer students the opportunity to study representations of Paris over the centuries as a way to practice writing, reading, and conversation in French and as a way to deepen their understanding of French and Francophone cultures. Materials for the course would include major literary texts as well as paintings, movies and popular songs, but also museum websites, local newspapers and local ads, brochures from retail and food malls, restaurant menus, postcards... such variety can be utilitarian and intellectually compelling at the same time. It would allow students not only to study language registers and vocabulary contextualization but also work on finding patterns and making connections. FREN UN3921 Witches, Fairies and Female Vampires in French Literature and Art. 3.00 points. A French inquisitor said in the 17 th century: “To one wizard, ten thousand witches.” The witches were seen, not only as “female wizards,” but as qualitatively different from wizards and warlocks. There was something fundamentally female about their magic. At first sight, witches, fairies and female vampires differ greatly. Yet they all embody a certain female (supernatural or natural) power, that fearful men tried to restrain and stigmatize over the centuries. Daughters of both Eros and Thanatos, they share features that were frowned upon by political and religious institutions. Moreover, female vampires may be former witches, while witches are often given names actually referring to fairies: the borders between those categories, whether it is in medieval or romantic literature, are definitely not as rigid as they might initially seem. The struggle against or for female magic occurred within literature and art. This class aims at showing how the artistic and literary representation of those creatures evolved from medieval times until our own, oscillating between condemnation, ambiguous fascination, and mere rehabilitation. It questions the role of gender politics in the literary construction of witchcraft and other supernatural phenomena. An important place is given to female French writers, who, for obvious reasons, envisioned those topics in a peculiar way, frequently turning negative stereotypes into sources of empowerment. The final two weeks will be devoted to a comparative, French-American approach to the Salem trials. We will discuss literary excerpts, short stories and poems (mostly in French though a vast majority are accessible in translation) as well as paintings and movies. The class is taught in French. It is principally designed for French and Comparative Literature majors, or advances undergraduates with a good knowledge of French CLFR GU4421 The Caribbean Digital. 3 points. The Internet is analogous in important ways to the Caribbean itself as dynamic and fluid cultural space: it is generated from disparate places and by disparate peoples; it challenges fundamentally the geographical and physical barriers that disrupt or disallow connection; and it places others in relentless relation. This class will both introduce students to the digital humanities and to the French-speaking Caribbean as a generative geo-cultural space for exploring the potential of the Internet to confront and disrupt many of the structures of dominance that have traditionally silenced marginalized voices. It will provide an introduction to several of the formats and tools that have facilitated such engagements, along with immediate critical reflection and discussion about their value to the academy. Since information technology has become one of the key ways in which the peoples of the French-speaking Caribbean and its diasporas both communicate with one another and gain access to global conversations, alongside this exploration of digital tools, in general, this class will consider how the Internet enables people in marginalized spaces to engage with crucial social problems and to express their intellectual and political perspectives.
