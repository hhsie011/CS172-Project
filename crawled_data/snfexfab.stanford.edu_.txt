See more news SNF Facilities The Stanford Nanofabrication Facility serves academic, industrial, and governmental researchers across the U.S. and around the globe. More than a lab, it's a vibrant research community. We are one of the four labs that are part of nano@stanford, under the NSF National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure program. SNF includes a 10,000 sq ft cleanroom housing tools for device fabrication and two satellite labs supporting Metallo Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) and new experimental fabrication methods (ExFab). SNF supports researchers in applications ranging from medicine and biology to fundamental physics and astronomy. We welcome researchers from all disciplines wishing to explore uses of micro- and nano- fabrication.
