Certification in Art Education prepares graduates to teach art to students from K-12. Certification is not always required by private institutions, but some may prefer to hire certified teachers. In order to become certified in Art Education, students must complete a bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited institution of higher education, pass the Praxis exams required in their state of employment, and satisfy other state-licensing examinations, as applicable. Temple University is a Pennsylvania state-approved teacher preparation program for K-12 Art. Completion of Temple University's Bachelor of Science in Education in Art Education or Master of Education in Art Education with Teaching Certification satisfies the necessary requirements for graduates to sit for the Praxis Core Academic Skills for Educators, Praxis Subject Assessments, and Praxis Fundamentals. For certification in some states, students may need to take the Praxis Principles of Learning and Teaching (PLT) exam for their desired grade levels, which they are prepared for through their field placements, classroom observations, and study of human development and pedagogy. https://www.education.pa.gov/Educators/Certification/BecomeAnEducator/Pages/ACPSpecialty.aspx Degree Requirements for the B.S.ED. in Art Education The Bachelor of Science in Education degree in Art Education may be conferred upon a student by recommendation of the faculty and upon the satisfactory completion of a minimum of 122 semester hours of credit with a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0.
