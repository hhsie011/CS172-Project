This is a separate charge from the student health insurance that may be waived. Secure Communication Select departments within Health and Wellness use secure messaging as a tool for communicating with you about personal health information (PHI), as it is more secure than email. This communication tool is not to be used in urgent situations. When we send you a message, you will receive an email to your Brown gmail account from Health-and-Wellness@brown.edu with the subject line "You have a health related message from Brown Health Services." The secure message becomes a permanent part of your medical record. Please review these messages and do not block them in your spam folder. Students can access secure messaging through the Brown Patient Portal.
