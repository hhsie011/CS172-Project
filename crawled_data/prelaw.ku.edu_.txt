We're here to help. Prelaw Advising offers resources to help you apply for law school and prepare for your legal education. Prelaw Advising Resources If you are looking for what classes to take to prepare you for law school, please contact the Undergraduate Advising Center. If you are interested in learning about how to take the LSAT, what to write for a personal statement or who to ask for letters of recommendation, you should attend a virtual info session. After you attend a virtual info session, you can schedule a personal session with Bryanna Hanschu, director of prelaw programming. You can also attend a virtual Prelaw Coffee Hour to ask questions. This site is a resource for you, but you should also consult other sources for insights and perspectives about choosing law as a career. KU has many resources for prelaw students, including organizations such as Phi Alpha Delta and activities to help you explore your options. We look forward to working with you as you pursue your goal of attending law school.
