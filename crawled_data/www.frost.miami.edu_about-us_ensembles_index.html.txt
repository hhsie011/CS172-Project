Regardless of your major, you can perform with many cross-genre ensembles. No need to stick with just one track or genre. We're all about diversity! "I think that now, in this generation, we can’t take it for granted that classical music can just pull us out there, just classical music alone. I think that someone has to be well versed in everything in order to make it in the music world. Here, I’ve also been able to experience jazz, bluegrass, and fiddle music." Miclen LaiPang, B.M.
