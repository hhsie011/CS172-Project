Our historical roots are truly interdisciplinary. The School is organized without the traditional departments or boundaries found at most schools; our model is focused on making unique connections between the various engineering disciplines. Along with our associations with the other scholarly disciplines – biology, medicine, physics, chemistry, computer science, the humanities and the social sciences – our co-operations bring unique solutions to challenging problems. The School focuses on unique and innovative clustering of faculty; in terms of research groups, engineers of all types team together with non-engineers to tackle some of the biggest problems facing engineering and science today. Our talents and expertise lie in the interdisciplinary domain where the seemingly diverse disciplines converge.
