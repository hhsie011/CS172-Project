The Dartmouth History Institute, which meets at the end of the academic year, is designed to explore the emerging trends and best new work in a particular sub-field of history by inviting finishing or recently-finished Ph.D. students to present and workshop parts of their dissertations in the company of senior scholars and editors. The theme changes from year to year. Previous Dartmouth History Institutes include the themes European Intellectual History (2017, directed by Udi Greenberg and Darrin McMahon) and New Directions in Medieval Religious History (2018, directed by Cecilia Gaposchkin and Walter Simons). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Institute was not held in 2020 or 2021. The 2022 Dartmouth History Institute (June 2-4, 2022) will focus on the theme of Illnesses in Asia: A Comparative History. The directors are Professors Soyoung Suh (Dartmouth College), Douglas Haynes (Dartmouth College), and Erqi Cheng (Syracuse University and Dartmouth College). For three days, new scholars will workshop chapter and article drafts, and discuss their plans for completing their book projects. They will be joined in discussion by senior historians and editors at major university presses.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of History Undergraduate Overview History FAQs for First Year and Transfer Students How to Declare a Major or Minor in History Major Modified Major Minor Transfer Credit Policy Course Descriptions First-Year Seminars Introductory Africa, Asia, Latin America & The Caribbean (AALAC) Europe (EUR) Interregional & Comparative (INTER) United States (US) Seminars & Colloquia Independent Study & Honors Course Schedule 2021-2022 Schedule 2022-2023 Schedule 2023-2024 Schedule Course Syllabi Honors Thesis Program General Timeline Guidelines for the Class of 2022 Guidelines for the Class of 2023 Honors Theses By Year Phi Alpha Theta Honors Society Prizes After Graduation Alumni Update Research Overview Faculty Research Initiatives Dartmouth History Institute Student Research Initiatives and Resources The Dartmouth Vietnam Project History Librarian Research Funding Resources Undergraduate Research Database Student Class Projects Foreign Study News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
