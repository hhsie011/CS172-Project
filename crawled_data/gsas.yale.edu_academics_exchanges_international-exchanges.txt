Yale doctoral students may participate in any international exchanges listed below. Most of them last one term or a full academic year, and a small number of exchanges are available for summers only. Through these reciprocal programs, graduate students can master course content in another language, learn new methodologies to inform their dissertations, visit library archives and collections to expand their research, and exchange ideas with fellow scholars from around the world. Doctoral students should consult with their faculty adviser and Director of Graduate Studies (DGS) about their academic progress and funding before submitting the application. For more information about specific exchange program please contact Associate Dean Jasmina Besirevic Regan. All international exchange agreements must be approved in advance by the Graduate School to ensure that they meet University policies and Graduate School guidelines. Departments interested in establishing an exchange program must prepare a statement that demonstrates that there is a clear academic and reciprocal need for such a program, and that the program will conform to the established guidelines for all such exchange agreements.
