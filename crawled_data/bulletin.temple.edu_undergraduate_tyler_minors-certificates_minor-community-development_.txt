Community Development as a field embraces both citizen activists and professionals in planned efforts to identify, enhance and create social and physical assets that increase the capacity of residents to improve their quality of life. Through this minor, students undertake formal studies about community development, thereby preparing themselves for contributions as informed citizens and civically engaged professionals. In this 18 credit minor, students will learn to understand and think critically about the social, political, economic, historic, and cultural dynamics shaping various types of communities. Courses provide important knowledge, values, and skills necessary for community development work. The three electives allow students to explore interests in different facets of community development. The minor provides students with stronger credentials to apply for graduate level work in planning and other related fields. Requirements Students must earn a minimum grade of C- in courses satisfying minor requirements and must have a minimum 2.0 grade point average in the required 18 credits to earn the minor. A student may not double count any course for the Minor in Community Development toward any other major, minor, or certificate. At least half of the courses for the minor must be taken at Temple University. Courses for the minor must be completed prior to graduation.
