The aggregate endowment is made up of more than 14,000 individual endowments created over the last 350 years, which support faculty and students, including professorships and financial aid for undergraduates, graduate fellowships, and student life and activities. Donor contributions to the endowment have enabled leading financial aid programs, groundbreaking discoveries in scientific research, and hundreds of professorships across a wide range of academic fields. Distributions from Harvard’s endowment provide a critical source of funding for the University. The endowment distributed $2.0 billion in the fiscal year 2021. While the endowment is a critical source of funding, 70% of the annual distribution is restricted to specific programs, departments, or purposes and must be spent in accordance with the terms set forth by the donor. Funds without donor restriction are more flexible in nature and are critical in supporting structural operating expenses and transformative, strategic initiatives.
