By Marie DeNoia Aronsohn June 14, 2021 For more than 71 years, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory researchers have scoured every corner of the world, plumbing the depths of the ocean for core samples, probing polar ice, scaling the heights of atmospheric dynamics, and publishing thousands of significant, often transformative, research papers. Along the way, they’ve made quite an impression on a universe of scientists and scholars. So, perhaps it’s not surprising that Lamont has dozens of planetary features named for these trailblazers and their research vessels. In all, we have identified 46 features of land, sea, and air named after Lamont affiliates. Check out the interactive map below to learn the who and where of these special places, and how our researchers garnered the honor of having these features named after them. #ldeo-features-map { width: 1px; min-width: 100%; border:none; } iFrameResize({},"#ldeo-features-map"); View a larger version of this map » Tags interactive maps Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory research-home News May 31, 2022 Aurora Barone Looks for Equitable Ways to Cut Carbon Emissions May 27, 2022 Sylhet City, Geology, and Packing Up May 25, 2022 Community-Led Science Uncovers High Air Pollution From Fracking in Ohio County May 20, 2022 Start of the Mini-Field School May 17, 2022 Lazy Bears and Confused Birds: What a Warming Planet Means for Wildlife Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory61 Route 9W · Palisades, NY 10964 Phone 845-359-2900 Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
