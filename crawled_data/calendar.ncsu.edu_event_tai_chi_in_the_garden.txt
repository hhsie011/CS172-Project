Originating from an ancient Chinese martial art, tai chi has developed as a graceful form of exercise involving a series of movements performed in a slow, focused manner accompanied by deep breathing. Each posture flows into the next without pause, ensuring that the body is in constant motion to achieve peace and calm.
