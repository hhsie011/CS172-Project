Alan Stewart, chair of the Depart- ment of English and Comparative Literature, portrays 16th and 17th century England as a site of multiple, sometimes conflicting possibili- ties, with innovations in biography, autobiography, and diary-keeping that laid the foundations for mod- ern life-writing. While classical and medieval models continued to exercise considerable influence, new forms began to challenge them. The saints’ lives that dominated the writings of medieval Catholicism were replaced with new lives of Protestant martyrs. Novel forms of self-ac- counting came into existence, such as daily moral accounts dictated by strands of Calvinism and financial self-accounting modelled on the new double-entry book-keeping. 212-854-5573 [email protected] Genre Nonfiction Topic Arts Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
