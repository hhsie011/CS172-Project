Anti-oppressive social work is a frame we are striving to use in the Garland School to promote our work for equality, honoring the dignity and worth of all people, with a focus on underrepresented and marginalized groups. Our approach to work for justice is informed by our Christian faith as well as our professional values and ethics. Christianity, as with the major world religions, seeks to challenge power inequities, center the lives of people who have been marginalized, and work for liberation for people who are oppressed. Our efforts to use the anti-oppressive framework are situated first in anti-racism, but take seriously an intersectional approach to justice work related to experiences of ethnicity, national origin, immigration status, sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, mental or physical ability, religion/spirituality, age and other marginalized identities in accordance with our professional Code of Ethics. The race focus of our work includes being actively opposed to racism in all its forms —individual, interpersonal, institutional, and structural... Read our Antiracism Statement A message from Dean Singletary The Garland School is committed to the ongoing work of antiracism as we make our way into the fall semester. Explicit action for racial justice must be strengthened in so many systems around us, but also here in the life of the school. A series of listening sessions this summer pointed out our shortcomings and the need for a stronger and more explicit race equity focus in the school. As a result, we are developing a race equity team of faculty, staff, students, and alumni looking at diversity, inclusion, and equity opportunities related to the curriculum, faculty makeup and leadership, and student support. We are already taking initial steps to incorporate more Black, Indigenous, and authors of Color in our courses and we know there will be even more work to do in this area. My hope in all of this work is that it will reflect inner transformation while creating outward change that matters in the lives of our community. While we know this work requires concrete action, the work for racial justice is also inner work. The spiritual component must be engaged as fully as the corporate elements. This is not easy to do as most of us lean more in either the direction of action or contemplation, while finding it a challenge to have a holistic, balanced approach. I hope we will keep this at the forefront of our hearts and minds as we take next steps together.
