Her research-based practice currently revolves around socio-musical memory, utopia, and identity through a first-generation American lens. As an artist and educator she aims to bring forward new ideas on how we construct cultures; ultimately working to describe a more poetic, inclusive, and reconciliatory global future. Stephanie was a 2019 Artist-in-Residence at the Contemporary Arts Center, part of a 2018 Artist-in-Residence Collaborative at the Price Hill Creative Community Festival, and has presented at conferences such as a2ru in 2020 and the Ohio Latino Student Summit in 2019. She has exhibited at the local and regional level throughout her college career, and worked for arts institutions such as the CAC and National Portrait Gallery. At UC she has been awarded Cincinnatus and Wolfstein scholarships, and outside of her studies conducted arts-based research through the UHP Discover program on a project called Who is American Today? with Dr. Flávia Bastos (a project which investigates the digital media skills and civic identity of high school students). Most recently, she received the 2022-23 Fulbright Study/Research Award to Peru. Currently, Stephanie is working as a research assistant on Who is American Today? and as part of a team lead by artist and professor Lorena Molina that received a 2022 ArtsWave Truth and Reconciliation grant to open a BIPOC-centered gallery in Cincinnati.
