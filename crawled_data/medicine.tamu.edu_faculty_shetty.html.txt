Research Interests Dr. Shetty’s laboratory is interested in developing clinically applicable strategies that are efficacious for enhancing brain function after injury, disease, or aging. The central areas of investigation are focused on the following topics. Mechanisms by which intranasally administered stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) promote neuroprotection, neuroregeneration, neural plasticity, and alleviate neuroinflammation. The sources of EVs include human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem cells (hiPSC-NSCs), astrocytes, and microglia. The model systems include penetrating traumatic brain injury (TBI), concussion or closed head injury (CHI), status epilepticus (SE), temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Mechanisms by which transplanted human neural stem cells or human GABA-ergic precursor cells derived from hiPSCs promote brain repair, and alleviate spontaneous seizures, and cognitive and mood impairments in prototypes of SE, TLE, and TBI. Elucidating mechanisms of brain dysfunction and chronic neuroinflammation in prototypes of Gulf War Illness. Developing therapeutic strategies to alleviate neuroinflammation, increased oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and learning, memory, and mood impairments in models of Gulf War Illness (GWI). Developing clinically feasible strategies for improving hippocampal neurogenesis and memory and mood function in aging and AD models via stimulation of endogenous neural stem/progenitor cells in neurogenic regions of the brain using drugs and biologics.
