The University published Pro Futuris in 2012 as the first extension of this strategic shift, emphasizing the goal of becoming a ‘Highest Research Activity’ (R1) institution according to the metrics of the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. Baylor’s colleges and schools each established its own strategic plan in response to general themes and goals listed in Pro Futuris. As a consequence, the College of Arts & Sciences (A&S) launched A&Spire, a plan with five academic themes: Liberal Education in the 21st Century; Becoming a Nationally Recognized Research Institution; Strengthening Community Engagement; Investing in Health; and Building the Financial Foundation. Each theme identified specific goals with accompanying acts of determination. Subsequent annual reports highlighted the accomplishments of A&Spire. Illuminate While Pro Futuris remains Baylor’s strategic plan, Illuminate targets specific research areas to propel the institution toward an R1 ranking. Illuminate identifies and describes four foundational Pillars and Five Signature Academic Initiatives as the means to reach this goal. The Four Pillars are as follows: Unambiguously Christian Educational Environment; Transformational Undergraduate Education; Research and Scholarship Marked by Quality, Impact, and Visibility; and Nationally Recognized Programs in Human Performance Through the Arts and Athletics. Emerging principally from Pillar 3, the Signature Academic Initiatives include Health; Materials Science; Human Flourishing, Leadership, and Ethics; Baylor in Latin America; and Data Sciences. These topical areas came mainly from discussions through focus groups and committees across campus. The proposals submitted by A&S originated from faculty committees that had been engaged in discussions for many months. Publication of Illuminate coincided with the launch of Baylor’s first comprehensive fundraising campaign, Give Light, ($1.1B over seven years) on November 1, 2018. A&Spire-to-Illuminate In response to Illuminate and the new University strategic plan and given that A&S has already accomplished many of A&Spire’s acts of determination, we recognize it is time to build upon and advance A&Spire in light of these new opportunities. We call this plan A&Spire-to-Illuminate. What you will find in this new five-year plan is a summary of contributions by A&S to the Four Pillars and Five Signature Academic Initiatives. In addition, we include a fifth pillar addressing the ways that the A&S plans to build on its efforts to create a learning environment that fosters diversity and inclusion. We in A&S intend to provide the leadership and accomplishments needed for Baylor to achieve its lofty goal of becoming one of only a few church-related R1 institutions with a strong commitment to undergraduate education. A&S will produce a report each year to indicate our progress. The Year 1 updates to the plan are marked in red on the following pages. College of Arts & Sciences With almost one half of Baylor’s undergraduate population and many of its research doctoral programs, A&S is composed of 25 departments representing the humanities, social sciences, and sciences, as well as numerous programs, institutes, and centers. We support the mission of Baylor University to ‘educate men and women for worldwide leadership and service by integrating academic excellence and Christian commitment within a caring community.’ About A Message from the Dean History of the College Academic Departments Arts & Sciences News Arts & Sciences Magazine A & S Magazine Archives A & S Magazine - Spring 2020 A & S Magazine - Fall 2020 A & S Magazine - Spring 2019 A & S Magazine - Fall 2019 A & S Magazine - Spring 2018 A & S Magazine - Fall 2018 A & S Magazine - Spring 2017 A & S Magazine - Fall 2017 A & S Magazine - Spring 2016 A & S Magazine - Fall 2016 A & S Magazine - Spring 2015 A & S Magazine - Fall 2015 A & S Magazine - Spring 2014 A & S Magazine - Fall 2014 A & S Magazine - Spring 2013 A & S Magazine - Fall 2013 Arts & Sciences Quick Facts Arts & Sciences Vision Board of Advocates Dean's Office Contacts James Vardaman Endowed Professorship Majors in Arts & Sciences Prominent Alumni Search Arts & Sciences Strategic Plan Introduction Pillar 1 - The Christian Educational Environment Pillar 2 - Transformational Undergraduate Education Pillar 3 - Research Pillar 4 - Human Performance in the Arts Pillar 5 - Fostering Diversity, Inclusion and Equity Signature Academic Initiatives Health Materials Science Human Flourishing, Leadership and Ethics Baylor in Latin America Data Sciences Financial Model Appendix Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion DEI in the Curriculum DEI in Faculty & Staff DEI in Research Student Support for DEI Opportunities for DEI Engagement Upcoming Events Arts & Sciences Committees A&S Curriculum Committee A&S Core Curriculum Advisory Committee Creative Arts Experience Committee A&S Faculty Award Nominations Committee Show More General Information Colleges, Schools, Libraries & Research Admissions Administration Gateways For...
