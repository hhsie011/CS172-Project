A registration hold is placed on a student’s account when they fail to come into compliance by mid-August (for Fall term) or mid-January (for Spring term). Students who remain non-compliant 30 days after the start of classes are disenrolled from the university. A fee applies if students later come into compliance and seek to re-enroll. Additional details and specific dates can be found at Cornell Health’s requirements for new students.
