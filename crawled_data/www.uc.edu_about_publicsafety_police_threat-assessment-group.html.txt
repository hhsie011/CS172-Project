If there is an emergency, call 9-1-1. If you have ongoing concerns of a person or a situation that may escalate into violence, but no current emergency exists, call Public Safety at 513-556-4900 or 513-556-1111 outside of normal business hours. Please clearly state your concerns and whether immediate police response is necessary or if a follow up by TAG is appropriate. What to expect from a referral If necessary, police will respond immediately. Otherwise, when you make a referral, someone from the university threat assessment team will speak with you about the concerning situation. The team will gather facts about the situation from various individuals and sources, then the team will analyze the information to see if there is a threat posed. In situations where there is a threat posed, the team will work with university offices and others to take necessary steps to reduce risk, help provide support to all who need it, and maintain safety. The goal of the threat assessment process is to ensure the safety of the campus community and of all involved.
