Presenters across five theme-driven panels discussed their upcoming work in India, China, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and beyond, and engaged in moderated Q&A discussions, addressing questions such as: What are the public policy implications of their projects? How will the COVID-19 pandemic affect their projects? What other challenges and obstacles do faculty and their research teams anticipate? How will faculty and research teams ensure that knowledge generated from their research is shared and preserved within local communities? What are the implications of your project for principles of justice? How do relationships with partners, universities, or research centers advance their work? What opportunities and challenges will faculty face in forming deeper equitable partnerships, and what will it take for these partnerships to flourish? A recording of the symposium is now available. 2022 Launch Symposium Additional Recordings Information Session for Prospective Applicants Before the 2022 Launch Symposium, Penn Global hosted an information session for faculty, staff, and students interested in applying to the Penn Global Research and Engagement Grant Program.
