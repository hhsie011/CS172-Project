Additional information can be found on the state’s Reopening R.I. website: https://reopeningri.com/ At Brown, since launching our routine testing program for the fall term on Aug. 24, we have conducted 146,477 asymptomatic tests to date. A total of 7,728 individuals have been tested in that timeframe, and the total number of positive test results is 179 (up 19 this week from a total of 160 last week; note that last week’s reported total of 162 positive test results inadvertently included 2 symptomatic test results) — a prevalence rate of 2.3%. Here are highlights of the testing program over the last seven days, Thursday, Dec. 3, through Wednesday, Dec. 9: -- There have been 19 positive asymptomatic test results: 14 from employees, 2 from on-campus students and 3 from off-campus students. As a reminder, our student testing program includes undergraduate, graduate and medical students. -- The employee asymptomatic positivity rate was 0.50%, and the student asymptomatic positivity rate was 0.13%. The Rhode Island positivity rate during this same time period was 9.79%. -- The average turnaround time for asymptomatic test results during this period was 24 hours. -- University Health Services conducted 32 symptomatic tests of students. Of these, 5 or fewer were positive for COVID-19. Exact results for symptomatic students who are tested by UHS are not reported (and do not appear on the public dashboard) to protect the confidentiality of the small numbers of students who are tested. We will report on ranges and any concerns regarding trends in these weekly summaries. -- The University does not directly test symptomatic employees, as they receive health care from their individual providers. We do monitor employee absences due to COVID-19 — which can be for a range of reasons, including care of a child or family member or quarantine due to a known exposure — and the number of such absences for the most recent full work week was 59. -- It is important to note that with regard to all positive cases, we have taken action consistent with our contact tracing protocols, COVID-19 Campus Safety Policy, isolation and quarantine procedures, and other measures outlined in Brown’s Plan for a Healthy and Safe 2020-21. As a reminder, if you are currently being tested once a week and would like to change to twice a week, you are welcome to do so. Students can email studenttesting@brown.edu to make that change. Faculty and staff can email employeetestinguhr@brown.edu for guidance on how to increase their testing frequency. Please feel free to contact us with any questions or concerns. For questions or support regarding the testing program, students can contact the student testing support team (401-863-6500, studenttesting@brown.edu), and faculty and staff can contact the employee testing support team (401-368-4828, employeetestinguhr@brown.edu).
