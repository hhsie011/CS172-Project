Get Ahead Quickly Every semester during the week before classes we create a unique experience aimed to help new students get off to the best start possible at TU. New Student Orientation this fall will be August 17-21, 2022. Complete this brief registration form to tell us your t-shirt size, dietary needs, and more. New Student Orientation is led by our team of Peer Mentors who host discussions, introduce students to campus practices and expectations, and share all kinds of information and success hacks with their students. The goal is to help you feel more comfortable starting college and to succeed quickly at TU. Check this page for the New Student Checklist to make your transition to TU seamless. For New Students StartTU is designed to help every new student StartTU off in the best way possible. We include timeless traditions, critical information, practical tips, and many meaningful connections with campus leaders to help students be ready for the first day of classes and the challenges of the first year in college. Here is just a sample of what we have built into your StartTU experience: Peer Mentors – These proven student leaders are selected and trained to help guide new students into the campus community. Peer Mentors offer helpful tips and ways to get ahead at TU. They serve as group facilitators during Orientation week and then stay connected to new students throughout the first year as friends and mentors in their students’ FYE 1001 course. These student leaders host some conversations in the summer before the school year starts, and serve as the primary facilitators of our week-long New Student Orientation. Faculty and Campus Professionals Connections – We introduce new students to a wide range of mentors from our faculty, professional staff and campus organizations. Research across the nation continues to demonstrate that connections with faculty and professionals can have a huge positive impact on a student’s educational experience. Community Service – serving our neighbors is part of our DNA at The University of Tulsa. Read to kids, paint murals, assist teachers or help with any number of other service opportunities provided by TU’s True Blue Neighbors volunteer center. Campus Glow Tour – Our night-time campus scavenger hunt is an annual tradition where you finish with lots of glow-gear and feeling like you already own the campus. For Parents and Families of New Students Students aren’t the only ones going through a big transition as they start college. Parents and families can find themselves with their own transitions taking place, and a wide range of emotions including excitement, satisfaction, uncertainty, and a strong sense of already missing their student. The University of Tulsa can help you and your family make those adjustments by helping you stay informed about what’s happening on campus and through the mutual support of other TU parents. See this page for ways to stay connected to the TU campus and to the TU Parent and Family Association. 800 S.
