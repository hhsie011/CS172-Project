Syracuse University offers internal (“intra-university”) transfer options into all of our schools and colleges. Students considering transferring between our schools and colleges must meet certain University requirements as well as any additional program-specific requirements before pursuing a course of study in a new school or college. Resources including academic advising and the Registrar are available to guide students through the transfer process.
