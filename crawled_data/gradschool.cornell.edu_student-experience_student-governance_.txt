In addition to representing the students in matters of university governance, the GPSA has the responsibility for setting and administering the student activity fee for graduate and professional students. The GPSA can serve as a valuable component of graduate or professional education for those who hope to be affiliated with a university in the future. Since the GPSA regularly meets with the president and provost and sends representatives to the University Assembly, the undergraduate Student Assembly, and the Faculty Senate, involvement in the GPSA can provide an introduction (or an advanced course!) to the mechanics of shared governance in a university setting. The GPSA: Represents graduate and professional student concerns to the university administration; Allocates funds to graduate and professional student groups and sets the student activity fee; Advocates for graduate and professional students on issues, including student resources, health care, insurance, transportation, and housing; and Provides support for graduate and professional student programming. To learn more about what the GPSA does, see the Graduate and Professional Community Initiative (GPCI), a strategic plan created by the GPSA to identify and address issues related to graduate and professional student life. Land Acknowledgement Cornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' (the Cayuga Nation). The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
