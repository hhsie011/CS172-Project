Originally from Little Rock, AR, Gabriel attended Lyon College where he became interested in the field of chemistry while synthesizing novel ruthenium compounds under the guidance of Dr. Floyd Beckford. After graduating in 2010 with a B.S. in Chemistry, he then continued his education at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN. There he worked with Dr. David Cliffel on a solar energy project where biomaterials were interfaced with electrodes. After completing his PhD. in 2014, he spent a year at the University of Texas at Austin working with Dr. Delia Milliron on a "smart-window" project to improve energy conservation in buildings by utilizing the unique properties of metal oxide nanoparticles and composites. Currently, Gabriel is interested in how 3D printing, electrochemistry, and materials science can be used to understand new phenomena and to solve real world problems.
