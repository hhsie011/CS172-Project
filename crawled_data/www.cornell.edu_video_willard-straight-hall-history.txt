It is only a little over a year old. It contains study rooms, reading rooms, club rooms, card and billiard rooms, two large cafeterias, tea rooms, and porches, and a large theater all in the same building. The whole campus is pretty these days." Harold E. [? Galvin, ?] March 6, 1927. "I must say, they make it nice for the overworked students. Every afternoon after the last exams, from 4:30 to 5:30, there is dancing coffee, tea, and cookies free to all at the Straight." John Hunter Detmold, January 27, 1942. On April 19, 1969, students occupied Willard Straight Hall during Parents Weekend as a continuing form of protest about racial issues on campus. Students occupied the building for 36 hours. The takeover received national attention, and thousands of black and white students became involved. The image of students leaving the Straight with guns is a lasting memory. However, the guns were introduced in the seizure of the building only after black students occupying the Straight were attacked and beaten. The takeover ended peacefully.
