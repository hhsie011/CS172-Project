The School is comprised of 44 faculty members, 225 undergraduate majors (one of the largest programs in the United States) and 130 graduate students. The Howey Physics Building is comprised of 26,000 sq. ft. of instructional space (classrooms and laboratories), 156,000 sq. ft. of research laboratory space, and adequate office space for faculty, post-doctoral fellows, graduate students and visitors. Undergraduate With a degree from the Georgia Tech School of Physics, you'll have the tools you need to succeed whether you decide to go to graduate school or into the industry after graduation. The Bachelor of Science in Physics prepares students for physics graduate programs while the Bachelor of Science in Applied Physics is better suited for entry into industry or preparation for graduate study in some other discipline. The School of Physics also offers Astrophysics Certificate and Astrophysics Concentration. Graduate The graduate program in the School of Physics provides the background and training needed to conduct and complete high quality, world-recognized research. Moreover, owing to the experiences we offer for supervised teaching of undergraduate laboratory courses, graduate students from diverse backgrounds develop into creative physicists who can function effectively in educational, industrial or government laboratory settings. Successful completion of the Ph.D. program in Physics requires (a) completion of course work, (b) participation in seminars and Special Problems, (c) acceptance into Ph.D. candidacy, and (d) thesis research.
