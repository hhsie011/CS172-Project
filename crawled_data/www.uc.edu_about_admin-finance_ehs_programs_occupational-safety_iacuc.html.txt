Personnel who already have allergies to other things may be at increased risk for developing allergies to animals. It is important to consult with your doctor about suspected allergies (cold like symptoms, difficulty breathing, rashes). Allergies can be managed through procedures such as desensitization, antiallergic medication, and prevention of exposure using personal protective clothing and equipment. Allergies can develop to latex gloves and other materials. Staff should be familiar with the signs of latex allergies and the means of preventing it. ZOONOSES: Occupational Health and Safety A zoonosis is a disease that can be transmitted from animal to humans. In many cases the disease can also be transmitted from humans back to animals. Zoonotic diseases can be prevented through a variety of means, including use of protective clothes, prevention of bites and scratches, proper sharps handling procedures, medical surveillance and vaccination programs, and post-injury treatment. Additional diseases may be significant depending on the species of animal, its microbiological status and animal handler’s health status. There are many sources of information on zoonoses some of those most pertinent to the research community are: CDC National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases: Disease Information, Prevention, and Program Areas Daniel Shapiro’s Zoonoses Web Page University of California, Davis – Risk Analysis Tools CDC: Zoonotic Diseases "Zoonoses or Everything I Didn't Want to Know About Wildlife Diseases" Division of Administration and Finance University Pavilion, Suite 630 2618 McMicken Circle PO Box 210620 Cincinnati, OH 45221-0620 UC Tools Canopy & Canvas One Stop Email Catalyst Shuttle Tracker IT Help UC VPN Bearcats Landing About Us Maps & Directions Jobs News Diversity Governance & Policies Directory Events Calendar University of Cincinnati | 2600 Clifton Ave. | Cincinnati, OH 45221 | ph: 513-556-6000 Alerts | Clery and HEOA Notice | Notice of Non-Discrimination | eAccessibility Concern | Privacy Statement | Free Speech | Copyright Information © 2020 University of Cincinnati Division of Administration and Finance University Pavilion, Suite 630 2618 McMicken Circle PO Box 210620 Cincinnati, OH 45221-0620 © 2020 University of Cincinnati scroll up to the top
