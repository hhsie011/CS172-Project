This 123-credit undergraduate degree will prepare you for careers in trans-disciplinary fields of study, such as environmental and biophysical sciences, that require a broad understanding of science and its applications. With careful selection of laboratory-based courses, students are well prepared for entry-level science positions and a variety of graduate programs, both disciplinary and interdisciplinary. The Natural Sciences Major provides a great basis for students wishing to enter graduate programs in education, forensic science, scientific writing or editing, or related science technology areas. Students may also tailor their class schedule to include some of the many courses required for a variety of pre-health and professional school programs. You’ll learn how to approach and solve mathematical problems, communicate scientific research through electronic media, speaking and writing, and process and evaluate both real-life and theoretical quantitative data. While studying the gamut of sciences, you’ll also acquire focused knowledge over four years by selecting a concentration in Biology, Chemistry, Geology or Physics. In order to fulfill the concentration requirement, students must complete upper-level science electives in their concentration area and take one writing-intensive course. Choosing between the BA and BS in Natural Sciences Based on your level of commitment to the natural sciences, you can choose between the 60- to 69-credit hour program for the BA in Natural Sciences or the 74- to 85-credit hour program for the BS in Natural Sciences. Though the BA in Natural Sciences creates a more flexible course load, the BS in Natural Sciences covers a wider range of the natural sciences with more required advanced science courses. Classes & Curriculum Students in this degree program must take the program’s introductory courses. After completing those requirements, students must take a qualifying examination. The introductory portion of the program includes 1 year of biology, 1 year of algebra-based or calculus-based physics, 1 year of general chemistry, 1 semester of geology, and 1 semester of programming.
