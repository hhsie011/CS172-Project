5:00 PM Istanbul Columbia Global Centers | Istanbul invited migration scholars from Turkey to participate in a global web conference meeting held in collaboration with the Columbia Population Research Center on “The Health Consequences of Migration: Emerging Directions in Scholarship and Research.” The event will be held at the Center in Istanbul, where access to the web conferencing service was provided. The invitation-only event featured a multi-disciplinary group of scholars from across the world who presented emerging scholarship and research about the health and well-being consequences of migration worldwide. The meeting aimed to clarify key questions in the field with an eye to establishing a global network of migration and health scholars who can continue the conversation, and galvanize scholarship in the area, in the coming decade. The meeting aimed to identify the key questions in migration research, with discussion centered around one question: What are key areas in research and scholarship around migration, health, and well-being that should be addressed over the coming decade? The conference was chaired by Dr. Sandro Galea, Chair of the Department of Epidemiology at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, and Dr. Julien Teitler, Associate Professor of Social Work and Sociology at the Columbia School of Social Work. A small number of participants have been invited to present for 12 minutes each in a manner that will generate discussion. These presentations were organized into thematically coherent panels. An agenda outlining these presentations and panels were sent to all attendees closer to the date. Columbia Global Centers | Istanbul invited key experts from around Turkey to participate in the discussion that we hope this meeting will engender. The discussion was all possible via the web conferencing service and we ensured that it was moderated to maximize generative cross-disciplinary discourse. The audience consisted of 30-50 guests worldwide, including academics, health professionals, students, and policy makers. With a selective and moderately sized audience the meeting aims to catalyze informed discussion and to move the field forward and to galvanize the intended network of global migration scholars. The language of the meeting was English.
