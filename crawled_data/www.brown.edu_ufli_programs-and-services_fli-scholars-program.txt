FLiSP aims to cultivate a strong community of leaders committed to social change by amplifying the strengths and knowledge that U-FLi students already bring with them when they come to Brown. Through collaborative bi-weekly events, strengths-based advising and navigational tools, scholars create meaningful connections among each other, develop their leadership and expertise around campus resources and establish a collective of supportive peers, faculty and staff. FLiSP utilizes a holistic view of U-FLi student development that equips them to thrive on mental, academic and social levels. Eligibility Must be a first-year student who identifies with any of the following student populations served by the U-FLi Center: undocumented, first-generation and/or low-income.
