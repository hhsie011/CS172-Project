Art Museum is committed to ensuring the safety and comfort of our visitors and our entire community. In the interest of health, safety, and providing a positive experience for all, Art Alive will again be a timed ticketed event. Art Alive 2022 will use timed tickets for admission to reduce lines and to limit capacity for a safe and pleasant visitor experience. Due to continuing COVID protocols, timed ticketing, and the anticipated crowds of people, you can enjoy this floral exhibit on your own between 9:00 am – 5:00 pm on Saturday or Sunday. Unlike previous years, we cannot plan for a formal CAASD group. However, perhaps you can coordinate your purchased timed ticket to meet up with CAASD fellow alumni on your own. Since this is a special event, no group tours are available. However, docents will be there to answer individual questions. Tickets: Free for Museum of Art Members | $40 non-members | $5 youth (7–17); Guest passes are not valid during Art Alive.
