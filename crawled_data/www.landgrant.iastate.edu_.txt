The first Iowans called for a new kind of college - one based on science and open to all; one dedicated to the education of the working people of Iowa. That was 1846, today we are Iowa State University. The stories here and ones yet to be added tell of our connection to each other, the land and the people's university. Sharing stories that recall how Iowa's land grant came to be and ones that tell of significant accomplishments made by those with ties to the university honors the dreams of early settlers. They are the basis of our legacy and nurture our hopes for future generations - and a strong Iowa. LOCATE LAND PARCELS ON THESE MAPS The Morrill Act of 1862 entitled states to federal land (30,000 acres per Congressman) for the support of a college teaching agriculture and mechanical arts. The land granted to Iowa is located in 27 northwestern Iowa counties. Those same counties contain land granted to 25 other states for the same purpose.
