Taps LL.M Alumnus as Head Economic Watchdog Santiago Alumni News: Chile’s President Taps LL.M Alumnus as Head Economic Watchdog December 18, 2018 Ricardo Riesco new prosecutor of the Chilean Competition Agency Ricardo Riesco, a lawyer with a Master in Laws (LLM’05) degree from Columbia University and a member of Columbia Global Center Santiago’s Advisory Board, has been appointed by Chile’s President Sebastián Piñera, in the context of a public contest, as head prosecutor of the Chilean Competition Agency (FNE for its initials in Spanish). The FNE is an independent agency charged with defending and promoting competition in all of Chile’s markets and productive sectors. The prosecutor investigates practices that may be considered leading to collusion, monopolies or illicit market concentration. It looks into any other act that may prevent, restrict or hinder competition, and it also advocates the benefits of a free market, looking to form a “culture of competition” in the country. Ricardo Riesco studied law at Chile’s Universidad Católica and has practiced law for more than 20 years, specializing in antitrust, free trade, litigation and arbitration. He has taught law in Chilean universities and was a visiting professor at Columbia University for 2017-18. He has written several legal papers in Chile, Spain, the US and Ecuador, and has presented at conferences in Chile, Peru and Brazil.
