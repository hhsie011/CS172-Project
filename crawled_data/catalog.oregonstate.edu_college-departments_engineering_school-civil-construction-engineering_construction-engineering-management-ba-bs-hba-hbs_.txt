This unique program blends principles of basic science, engineering, and technology with a strong component of business subjects to prepare graduates for a productive career in the construction industry. The BS in Construction Engineering Management is ACCE accredited. The CEM program is built on a rigorous four-year curriculum that emphasizes practical applications as well as basic principles. Students are given hands-on experiences in the laboratory and are involved in field trips as a supplement to their classroom activities. A more detailed explanation of the CEM Program is contained in the "Construction Engineering Management Advising Guide," which may be viewed on the school's website. The mission of the CEM program is to provide a comprehensive, state-of-the-art education to prepare students for professional and responsible constructor positions with business, industry, consulting firms or government. The program's educational objectives are to: Provide a compelling education based in the natural sciences, mathematics, engineering sciences, and business, and in the fundamental paradigms, concepts, understandings, applications, and knowledge of civil and construction engineering and construction management. Develop students' abilities through their education to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate information, solve engineering problems, and be prepared to effectively perform project engineering and management tasks for effective execution of construction projects. Provide education for modern professional practice including the abilities for effective communication, collaborative work in diverse teams, ethical decision-making, successful management of personal and professional career objectives, and continual development through lifelong learning and professional involvement. Prepare our graduates for either immediate employment or for graduate school opportunities in construction or business. Provide students with knowledge of contemporary societal issues and a sensitivity to the challenge of meeting social, environmental, and economic constraints within a global community.
