Portfolio [ ] Upload portfolio as a single pdf through the portfolio credential on MyStatus. The portfolio helps the reviewers determine your potential to perform successfully in a studio-based design curriculum. In order to fairly and accurately review each application, the admissions committee requires evidence in one or more categories: The level of creative skill you possess in any medium. The extent of your interest in the M Arch, made evident through your abilities in composition, physical form-making, or perception of the environment. Your ability to translate ideas into physical form, even if in simple terms such as drawing. FORMAT Portfolios should be designed and formatted for on-screen viewing (avoid a double spread layout). The maximum file size is 25 MB. ATTRIBUTION For each project, list the applicant’s name, the project’s date, and an indication as to whether the project was academic, office-related, or personal. In the case of collaborative or professional work, the contribution by the applicant must be precisely described. ORGANIZATION The organization of the portfolio is a design exercise. It should be clear, succinct, and thoughtfully composed to best reflect your interests and skills. The quality of the work is of greater importance than quantity. applicants with little to no prior background in design The portfolio is not expected to show architectural skills. Rather, it should contain work that demonstrates facility with a variety of media and illustrates three-dimensional understanding. You may demonstrate your creative, artistic, and perceptual skills through painting, sculpture, or other three-dimensional explorations, such as objects you have designed and constructed. Photography as an example of creative work must demonstrate intention in composition, color/light, or other critical point of view. applicants with design backgrounds Applicants seeking advanced placement should submit examples of work demonstrating an ability to pursue study at an advanced level. The portfolio should be of high quality and provide evidence of well-developed graphic skills, a sense of design (including integration of building technologies), and an understanding of space, form, and volume at different scales. The committee assumes the portfolio represents the applicant’s best abilities in design.
