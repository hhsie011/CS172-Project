This unit is engaged in activities designed to help create a more inclusively diverse community of learners at OSU. We aspire to work with all individuals interested in promoting this work. The Retention Initiative for Student Excellence (RISE) and the Inclusion Leadership Program (ILP) are among the initiatives set forth to accomplish these goals. Retention Initiative for Student Excellence (RISE) Inclusion Leadership Program (ILP) University Recruitment, Retention and Community Engagement TRIO and Sponsored Research Programs TRIO programs are funded by grants from the Department of Education. They were initiated in response to President Lyndon Johnson’s “War on Poverty.” TRIO Programs began in 1964 with the creation of three initial programs, they became known as the federal TRIO Programs. Since that time, more programs have been added, but the name remains the same.
