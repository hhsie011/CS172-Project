Please also review our clinical faculty members' websites and identify 1-3 Clinical Psychology faculty members with research interests that fit with your interests.

Based on our academic judgment as to the best preparation for clinical psychologists, our program is committed to providing training that will prepare all students to work with client populations that are diverse with respect to a variety of characteristics (e.g., age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, disability status). Students completing clinical training in our program are required to provide services to all clients deemed appropriate by their supervisors. Issues of Licensure. Please note that both the Clinical Doctoral Program and the School Psychology Programs in the Department of Psychology may lead to professional licensure. The following questions relate to your potential ability to receive licensure. Have you ever been convicted of a felony or crime(s) other than minor traffic offenses? Have you ever been denied licensure for the profession for which you might apply for licensure or had discipline imposed by another state's licensing board? Have you ever had a civil suit judgment entered against you or entered into an adverse civil settlement? If you answered "yes" to any of the questions above, it is possible that you may be denied licensure at the conclusion of the degree program to which you are applying. Please review the licensure requirements specific to the discipline by contacting the specific licensing board. It is your responsibility to understand the criteria necessary for licensure and to ensure compliance with those criteria. If you have any questions about the licensure requirements and your ability to be licensed, please contact: Clinical Program: Dr. Meghan McDevitt-Murphy, mmcdvttm@memphis.edu Also, you should be aware that criminal convictions may make you ineligible to participate in clinical experiences included in your program, therefore necessitating your removal from the program and/or impacting your ability to successfully complete course and program requirements. Your signature on the application shall serve as your acknowledgment that you have answered the above questions truthfully, have conducted due diligence in determining your potential eligibility for licensure, and that you are aware that certain factors may prevent your eligibility for licensure.
