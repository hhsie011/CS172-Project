All campus community members should be aware that sexual assault can happen to anyone and that sexual assault is not the victim’s fault. SMU and community resources are available to help, including SMU Police, SMU Counseling Services, the Office of Student Advocacy and Support, and the SMU Title IX Coordinator. It is critical that anyone who has experienced sexual assault find safety and seek medical attention immediately. See "Medical care" for more information. Students also are urged to report a sexual assault to police as soon as possible, call 911 or 214-768-3333, or pick up a blue-light phone on campus. Sexual assault is a crime punishable under Texas law by imprisonment. Sexual assault also is a violation of the federal law Title IX and of SMU's Title IX Sexual Harassment policy. See "Report to police" and "Sexual assault and consent" for more information. If you are a victim, please know that you are not alone. SMU resources are available to help and discuss your options.

In case of dating violence, domestic violence or stalking As in cases of sexual assault, the first priority for victims of dating violence or domestic violence is to get to a place of safety and obtain medical attention and a forensic exam that preserves evidence. Victims of domestic violence, dating violence or stalking also are urged to contact police as soon as possible. Victims of violence or stalking also should save evidence such as any letters, emails, phone calls, videos, photos, texts, social media postings, computer screenshots, voicemails or other evidence that may be helpful in obtaining a protective order or pursuing criminal charges.
