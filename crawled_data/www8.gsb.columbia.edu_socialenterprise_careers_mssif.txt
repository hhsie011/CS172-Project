The next generation of leaders that will innovate scalable finance solutions to sustainability challenges will need to navigate the complexity of capital markets and manage an array of stakeholder interests. Leadership and capital are required to meet these challenges head-on. With its world-class platform for advising, originating, trading, managing and distributing capital, Morgan Stanley is partnering with Columbia Business School, a global leader in business school education, to develop the next generation of leaders. Overview Program & Recruiting Videos Fellows Overview In collaboration with Columbia Business School, Morgan Stanley launched the Sustainable Investing Fellowship in 2013 to cultivate emerging leaders in sustainable finance and investing. The Sustainable Investing Fellowship was announced at the launch of the Morgan Stanley Institute for Sustainable Investing, which aims to mobilize private-sector capital to address major economic, social and environmental challenges and develop the next generation of leaders at the intersection of sustainability and finance. The Sustainable Investing Fellowship is co-managed by the Tamer Center for Social Enterprise at Columbia Business School and the Morgan Stanley Institute for Sustainable Investing and offers a select group of Columbia students the opportunity to design and implement efforts that seek to drive capital toward investments that promote sustainable economic growth.
