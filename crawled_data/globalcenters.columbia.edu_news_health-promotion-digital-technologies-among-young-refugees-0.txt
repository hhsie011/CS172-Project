You can find more information on the PGIF project below: This project aimed to use a community-based participatory research approach to explore and promote the use of digital technologies among young refugees to improve their access to health information and services in Turkey. The project kicked-off with a stakeholder workshop in Istanbul to discuss current problems and solutions regarding health literacy and health care access issues among refugees. The project team then conducted a qualitative photo-voice study with young refugees and local youth in Istanbul, in addition to in-depth interviews with health workers and policymakers to assess the current trends and gender-specific needs for digital tools including mobile apps to access health information and services among refugees. In this online photo exhibition and panel, the findings of the photo-voice study will be shared to raise awareness on using digital health technologies for health promotion in forced migration settings.
