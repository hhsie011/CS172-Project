There are many ways for your company to connect with our exceptional students. DSI educates and engages graduate and certification students who are studying an interdisciplinary curriculum, including algorithms for data science, machine learning, data visualization, statistics, and probability. Our students pursue part-time and full-time internships throughout their studies and are interested in pursuing career opportunities in a variety of data science roles in many locations and industries. We are thrilled to announce the launch of Columbia Engineering Career Connect (powered by VMock) to assist with your recruitment efforts. We are excited to launch this new platform because it connects employers with our talented engineers (data scientists and engineers ) based on each student’s unique profile and experience. Within the platform, employers can post positions, search for profiles of students who meet specific criteria and batch export their resumes, schedule interview appointments (either by inviting specific students or allowing students to sign-up), and organize both in-person or virtual events. We would love to connect our students to opportunities at your organizations. If you do have any job postings you would like to share, please feel welcome to sign up and begin posting here: https://career.engineering.columbia.edu/content/career-connect-employer Post a Job or Internship with Us Please complete this form and we will get your post into the inboxes of current DSI students and alumni who have indicated they are interested in receiving such opportunities. We can also help collect résumés and schedule virtual interviews with your top candidates. Recruitment during the 2022-23 Academic Year Please contact us to discuss virtual opportunities to connect and engage with current students and alumni during these challenging and unprecedented times. We can get you in front of the DSI talent you seek. Offered in one-hour increments, these virtual events will be hosted from late September through mid-November and from late January through the end of April (excluding spring break). Employer Meetups This 90-minute networking event provides an opportunity for you to tell your story and offer insight into your field, firm, or the roles for which you are recruiting. MeetUps are organized by industry sectors and verticals and typically attract 30 to 50 current DSI students and recent graduates. Industry Panels Join us as an industry insider during one of our virtual data science industry panels. We invite industry professionals and alumni to discuss their career trajectories and inform DSI students about industry trends.
