Truett Seminary>Admissions>Why Truett?>Culture & Community Culture & Community Baylor’s Truett Seminary offers renowned academic programs with rigorous curriculum and a faculty distinguished in their fields of study. However, the Truett experience is more than just what happens in the classroom. At Truett Seminary, we offer a community and culture that encourage spiritual growth, broaden viewpoints, and form and strengthen relationships. Conferences & Events Beyond classroom learning Truett Seminary hosts numerous conferences and events, featuring both internal and external experts, designed to enrich the education of Seminary students, as well as alumni and friends. The annual African American Preaching Conference and National Preaching Conference have featured some of the nation’s most respected homileticians. Other events hosted by the Seminary include the Science & Christian Ministry Conference, Texas Baptist Women in Ministry Conference, Financial Wellness for Ministry Workshops, and more. Student Organizations At Truett Seminary, we recognize the need for our students to come together with their peers to form special interest groups. These organizations provide deepened community for members as well as educational opportunities for other Truett students, faculty, and staff. The Truett Black Student Association and Truett Women in Ministry groups are two such organizations that, in addition to internal activities and meetings, help to enhance the experience of their fellow students by leading Truett Chapel each year and hosting educational movie nights. Community Gatherings Relationships are formed and strengthened both within the classroom and outside of it at Truett Seminary. Throughout each semester the Seminary hosts a number of social and informational gatherings for students, faculty, and staff. From Fall Picnic to Truett Chapel lunches, these get-togethers are an opportunity for the entire Truett community to connect with one another. Special Interest Courses While the Truett curriculum includes a thorough compilation of theology, Scripture, and practical courses, Seminary faculty also offer unique opportunities to study topics in which they possess special expertise. This includes courses like Teaching for Transformation, Always On with Dr. Angela Gorrell and Black, Latino/a, and Asian North American Preaching with Dr. Jared Alcantara. Spiritual Development While academic instruction is imperative to a seminary education, spiritual development is equally as essential. At Truett, spiritual development is encouraged in numerous ways but most directly through weekly Chapel services and Covenant Groups. Through Covenant Groups Truett students meet weekly with a small group of peers for four semesters, creating space both to learn about spiritual formation and to practice it with one another. Truett’s weekly Chapel services are an opportunity for the entire seminary community to gather together for a time of worship and learning. Baylor and Waco Truett Seminary is one of the 12 schools and colleges of Baylor University, making Truett students Baylor Bears! Seminary students are able to take advantage of the many Baylor student life offerings, from large-scale events like Diadeloso and Christmas on 5th Street to Dr Pepper Hour, music and theatre performances, Big XII athletics, exercise and health facilities, and more. Baylor University’s campus—which includes Truett—is located in Waco, Texas. A reasonable drive away from the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex and Austin, Waco is home to one of the largest municipal parks in Texas, the famed Magnolia Silos, a rising food scene, and more.
