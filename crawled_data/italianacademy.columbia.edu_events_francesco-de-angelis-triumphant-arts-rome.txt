Before coming to New York, he has worked at the Deutsches Archäologisches Institut in Rome and at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa. He has been the recipient of a two-year fellowship from the Getty Research Institute and of a Humboldt fellowship in Heidelberg. His research interests touch upon various aspects of Greek, Etruscan, and Roman art and architecture, among which: the relation between visual evidence and written texts; mythological images and their contexts; the role of monuments in the transmission of cultural memory and identity; the architecture and topography of justice in the Roman world; the reception of the classical past in modern scholarship. His approach lays strong emphasis on intercultural influences and on the value of cross-cultural comparisons.
