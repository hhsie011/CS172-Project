Courses Environmental Studies Learning Outcomes The Environmental Studies Program offers an interdisciplinary curriculum to students interested in perspectives on sustainability from faculty and courses across the university. Both a major and a minor are available to qualified students. The goals of the major are to provide students with: the knowledge and perspective to cultivate rewarding lives as responsible citizens of the planet; a deep understanding of the scientific, political, and cultural aspects of the world's environmental challenges; the tools and creativity necessary to envision and implement paths to sustainable solutions; and a solid background for environmentally related graduate programs and/or careers in business, education, law, policy, planning, government, or research. Environmental Studies Courses Environmental Faculty Environmental Studies Website Print Open All Close All Applying for the Environmental Studies Major Applying for the Environmental Studies Major Students are admitted into the Environmental Studies major by application at the end of the freshman year. Acceptance is determined by the Steering Committee of the Environmental Studies Program, which includes faculty drawn from many departments and an associate dean from the Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences. Criteria for admission include academic achievement and a personal statement. The deadline for submitting applications is the last day of classes, at the end of students’ first year. The application form may be found at Apply for the Major page. Major Requirements Major Requirements The ENVS major consists of a minimum of 43 credits, equivalent to at least 14 full-semester courses, as detailed below. ENVS students may choose more than one major, but at least 27 credits for the ENVS major must not be used to fulfill requirements for another major or minor (i.e., 16 credits can be shared). Note that all Boston College majors require at least 27 unique credits, so the number of credits that can be shared will be fewer for majors that require fewer courses, such as most departmental majors (i.e., if a major requires 30 credits, only 3 can be shared). A. Environmental Studies introductory seminar ENVS1100 (1 credit) This seminar is offered in the fall semester for the new cohort of ENVS majors (sophomores). It involves readings of classic texts in environmental studies, and it is similar in structure to Cornerstone courses. B. Eight credits of Environmental Systems courses: EESC2201 Environmental Systems: The Human Footprint plus three of any of the following courses (and labs EESC2211–2218): EESC2202 Environmental Systems: Ecosystems EESC2203 Environmental Systems: Water Resources EESC2204 Environmental Systems: The Critical Zone EESC2205 Environmental Systems: Climate Change EESC2206 Environmental Systems: Oceans EESC2207 Environmental Systems: Earthquakes EESC2208 Environmental Systems: Quantitative Methods These are a series of 2-credit half-semester courses that introduce students to the basic concepts of environmental science from a variety of perspectives and professors, with the specific goal of providing students with a foundation for further interdisciplinary study of environmental issues. Students can take one or more of these courses in any given semester. Approved substitutions include: EESC1167 for EESC2201, EESC1170 for EESC2203, EESC1174 or EESC1505 for EESC2205, and EESC1157 for EESC2206.
