Matter Juerg M. Matter I have several research interests in the intersection between geology, climate change and energy. I am especially interested in geologic carbon sequestration and how fluid-gas-rock reactions can lead to secure and permanent sequestration of industrial carbon dioxide., Currently, I am working in three overlapping areas: CO2-water-rock interactions and reactive flow in deep aquifers Fluid flow and solute transport in saturated media Subsurface fluid injection and geomechanical stability of reservoir rocks Some of my projects include: Secure and long-term sequestration of industrial carbon dioxide in calcium-magnesium silicate rocks Big Sky Carbon Sequestration Partnership Mineral carbon dioxide sequestration into basalt - CarbFix Project, Iceland Natural carbon sequestration in ophiolite peridotites - Rates and mechanism of serpentinization and carbonation Permanent carbon dioxide sequestration in ocean sediments: flow-through reactor studies Fields of Interest Carbon Sequestration, Hydrogeophysics, Flow and Transport in Saturated Media Education Ph.D., Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland, 2001 Diploma in Earth Sciences, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland, 1997 Adjunct Senior Research Scientist, Geochemistry Areas of Expertise carbon sequestration Hydrogeophysics Contact Info University of Southampton, NOCS European Way Waterfront Campus Room 164/40 Southampton, HANTS 501332H USA +4402380593042 [email protected] Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory61 Route 9W · Palisades, NY 10964 Phone 845-359-2900 Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
