For the public to be swayed from positions they have already staked out, and for government officials to respond to charges that they behaved corruptly or unconstitutionally or simply rashly and unwisely, the information has to come from organizations that hold themselves to the highest standards of verification, fact-checking, and independent and original research, exactly what professional journalism aspires to do. 212-854-5573 [email protected] Genre Nonfiction Topic Journalism Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
