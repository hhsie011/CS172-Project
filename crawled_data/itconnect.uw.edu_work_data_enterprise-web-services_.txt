Contact UW-IT About UW-IT Enterprise Web Services The Enterprise Web Services (EWS) are a secure collection of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that integrate data to and from many sources across UW. The EWS is a system of reference that enables enterprise business applications to access commonly shared source data in a scalable, real-time, and highly available architecture. The goal of Enterprise Web Services is to enable enterprise business applications to access commonly required source data. The primary purpose for providing this data via APIs is to reduce duplicate shadow systems and the proliferation of sensitive business data. Learn more about EWS and check out our Case Study Understand the data If you’re a system integrator, one of the biggest challenges is understanding what is available and how to access it. These resources can help you get started.
