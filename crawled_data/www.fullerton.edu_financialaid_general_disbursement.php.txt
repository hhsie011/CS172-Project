These payment are called "disbursement" and begins the week before classes start each semester. With the exception of Chafee Grant, all financial aid, including Parent Plus loans, will first be applied to all charges, which includes but not limited to: Mandatory state, Campus fees, and housing charges - if residing on campus. Any remaining financial aid after all charges are paid are refunded to the student. Please see Student Business Services regarding issuing refunds or making payments. Important Policy The Repeated Coursework Policy affects the student's disbursement as well. Please review the repeated coursework policy page for your knowledge. All student's financial aid will be re-evaluated at the census date - established by Admission and Records - based on locked enrollment. Student can be billed if enrollment drop below full-time.
