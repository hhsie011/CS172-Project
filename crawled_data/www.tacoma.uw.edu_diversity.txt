The Office of Equity and Inclusion was created to help cultivate an institutional vision and commitment to diversity while ensuring an equitable environment for all members of the UW Tacoma community. This means paying attention to policies and practices involving management, leadership, communication, resources, scholarship, and community. It includes focusing attention on the demographic composition of UW Tacoma and our surrounding community of the South Puget Sound to be certain that we know who are our students, faculty, staff, and community partners in order to better serve and work with all. In addition, we address our institutional systems as a means of better serving all faculty, students, and staff. Because UW Tacoma's mission clearly states that the University exists to "educate diverse learners and transform communities by expanding the boundaries of knowledge and discovery," equity, inclusion and diversity are linked to UW Tacoma's success and the academic achievement of UW Tacoma students. Land Acknowledgement We recognize that all of us at UW Tacoma learn, live, and work on or near the ancestral homeland of the Coast Salish people. In particular, our campus is situated on the current and traditional land of the Puyallup. And we also want to acknowledge the lands of the Muckleshoot, Nisqually, Suquamish, Duwamish, and all other traditional lands we may reside on. As people on these occupied territories, we acknowledge the land, the ancestors who have cared for this land since time immemorial, and all of our Native and Indigenous connections today. We also acknowledge the histories of dispossession and forced removal that have allowed for the growth and survival of this nation and institution. In light of this history, we have a responsibility to take active efforts to partner with our Native and Indigenous community members and neighbors to seek justice as we continue our work together as a community of learners, leaders, and educators. Our Commitment to Diversity To hold constant a nurturing learning and work environment in the midst of change, each member of our UW Tacoma community has the responsibility to build and sustain respectful and supportive relationships, through which intolerance, discrimination and social injustice are confronted and resolved through non-violent behavior. We are committed to confronting and dismantling systemic racism, including anti-Blackness, colonialism, xenophobia, and all other forms of oppression, wherever we encounter them as we work toward institutional equity and social justice. The University of Washington Tacoma’s commitment to diversity is central to maintaining an atmosphere wherein students, staff, faculty and South Sound residents find abundant opportunities for intellectual, personal and professional growth.
