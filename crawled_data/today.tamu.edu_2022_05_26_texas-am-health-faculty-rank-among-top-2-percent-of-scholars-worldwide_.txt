It was compiled by researchers at Stanford University using data from Elsevier’s Scopus — a curated abstract and citation database of peer-reviewed literature — and considers six citation metrics. It includes two different versions: single year performance and career-long performance. The following Texas A&M Health scholars appear in the career-long list, which assesses scientists for the impact of their citations from 1996 until the end of 2020. College of Dentistry Peter H.
