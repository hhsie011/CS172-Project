Listening Repertory Lists Majors will be asked to identify important works from the Western tradition in a series of Listening Repertory exams. Each year of the music major (normally three), a list of works will be given to the student that they must be able to identify by the end of the year. A listening test on each of three lists of works will be administered until the student passes. Ear Training/Sight Singing All Majors will be expected to have passed the minimum competency requirements in Ear Training and Sight-Singing before graduation. The course MUSA 1090-2090 Ear-Training and Sight-Singing, a one-credit course, is designed and recommended as an aid to passing this test Recommended Course of Study Information For First Year Included in the University's Core Curriculum is one course in the Arts (Fine Arts, Music, or Theatre). MUSA 1200 Introduction to Music, and MUSA 1100 Fundamentals of Music Theory, and MUSA 1300 History of Popular Music are the Music Department's Core offerings. They are designed for the non-musician as well as the student who has studied music. Prospective music majors and minors should reference the Recommended Course of Study listed below. Students with advanced musical backgrounds and interests should speak to the Director of the Undergraduate Program in Music regarding appropriate upper-level courses. The department offers MUSA 1320 Introduction to Musics of the World as an option for the Cultural Diversity requirement of the Core. Freshman Year All students declaring the music major should try as freshmen to take or test out of MUSA 1100 Fundamentals of Music Theory, a course covering the notation of music and fundamental ear-training. Either of these courses is a general introduction to the field and its various methodologies, and a student may receive retroactive credit for the major if passed with a B+ or higher. Sophomore Year Harmony and Chromatic Harmony should be taken in sequence along with MUSA 1090 - 2090, Ear Training/Sight Singing Labs.
