Students at Brown want to create and navigate their own intellectual journeys. As a result, no two applicants share the same background. Applications to our graduate programs are reviewed holistically by faculty-led admissions committees. Application Requirements A completed application to the Brown University School of Professional Studies includes: Completed Online Application Academic Transcript(s) Personal Statement and Supplemental Essays (if applicable) Letters of Recommendation (3) Application Fee International Applicants: At this time, we do not offer I-20 certificates for students in the Healthcare Leadership and Technology Leadership master's programs due to their blended low-residency/online program formats. Other visa types are not supported for studying in the United States. If you do not require a visa to study in the United States, but received your degree(s) outside of the United States, we require a course-by-course credential evaluation sent directly from World Education Services (WES) to the Brown University School of Professional Studies. The IE Brown Executive MBA is an authorized F-1 program and can issue I-20s to qualified international students to attend the Brown-hosted sessions in United States. It is the student’s responsibility to obtain the F-1 entry visa from the Department of State. The application process is managed by our partner institution, IE Business School, so please refer to the IE online application for more information about fulfilling transcript requirements.
