UCCI offers implementation support on several validated, third/fourth generational tools developed both here at UC as well as others commonly used tools to measure criminogenic risk/needs. To best insure programs are used with fidelity, assessor training and certification are required prior to implementation. UCCI Assessments In line with our mission, UCCI has worked closely with both field experts and statewide systems to research and develop two separate risk assessment systems for adult and juvenile populations. Each includes a suite of tools to be used at various decision points across the criminal and juvenile justice systems. UC's tools were created in partnership with the state of Ohio, and are offered freely to state, county, local, and provider agencies. After being trained on the tool, corrections professionals are permitted to reproduce and photocopy materials needed to conduct individual assessments without paying UC ongoing licensing costs for the paper version. Separate cloud-based automation is available for purchase though a partnership with UC's Information Technology Solution Center (ITSC), and includes yearly help-desk and maintenance support. This state-of-the-art system housed here at the University of Cincinnati includes a dashboard with various modules to not only assess and house risk/need data, but also offers modules to support assessment-driven case planning as well as reporting and data visualization features. DEMO VIDEO Ohio Risk Assessment System (ORAS) The ORAS is a dynamic risk/needs assessment system that assesses individuals at various decision points across the criminal justice system: Pre-trial, Prison Intake, Community Supervision, Misdemeanor, and Reentry (separate tools for long- and short-term prison stays. ORAS Overview Ohio Youth Assessment System (OYAS) The OYAS is a dynamic risk/needs assessment system that assesses youth at various decision points across the juvenile justice system: Diversion, Detention, Disposition, Residential and Reentry. OYAS Overview Assessment-Driven Planning Case Planning (CP) Research supports that assessment-driven case planning is the most effective means of strategizing interventions. As such, UCCI has developed a structured training to teach staff a collaborative approach to case planning that incorporates four foundational components: needs, goals, objectives, and techniques. CP Overview "CP was presented at the perfect pace. We were able to learn pieces individually then practice application. I walked away feeling confident in what I had learned." Other Assessments Level of Service Inventory - Revised (LSI-R) This tool is an actuarial assessment tool that seeks to identify an individual’s risks and needs with regard to recidivism, and is one of the most researched risk/need instruments currently in use. LSIR Overview Level of Service/Case Management Inventory (LS/CMI) This tool is a combined dynamic risk/needs assessment for adults and a fully functioning case management tool. This assessment is based on the same principles and theory behind the LSI-R with modifications to shorten the tool and include updated research. LS/CMI Overview Youthful Level of Service/Case Management Inventory (YLS/CMI) This tool is a combined risk/needs assessment for youth and a fully functioning case management tool. This assessment is based on the same principles and theory behind the LSI-R with modifications for juvenile populations. YLS/CMI Overview Women's Risk Needs Assessment (WRNA) In 2008, the National Institute of Corrections in cooperation with the University of Cincinnati announced the availability of a series of new risk/need assessments for adult, women offenders. The assessments include: 1) a full instrument, The Women’s Risk/Needs Assessment (WRNA), which assesses both gender-neutral and gender-responsive factors and affords separate forms for probation, prison, and pre-release; and 2) the Women’s Risk/Needs Assessment - Trailer (WRNA-T) which is designed to supplement existing risk/needs assessments such as the Level of Service Inventory - Revised or the Northpointe COMPAS. The WRNA-T is also available in yuseparate forms for probation, prison, and pre-release populations. Training Opportunities UC partners with Dr. Emily Salisbury and the University of Utah to offer training on the WRNA tool. Dr. Salisbury, a co-author of the WRNA creation project, is a well-known researcher on women offenders. For more information please visit the Utah website.
