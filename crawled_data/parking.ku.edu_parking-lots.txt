Vehicles may only park in areas designated for parking. Remember, if the sign does not say you can, then you cannot. Most parking lots are restricted year-round. During hours when an area is controlled, parking is restricted to vehicles with permits or parked at paid meters. If parked at a meter in a parking lot, you must insert payment, even if you have a colored permit for that parking lot. Find more information about parking lots in the KU Parking Rules & Regulations.
