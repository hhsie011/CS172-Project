Silk, silver, and parchment relics, oil paintings and forgotten letters: the displays will illustrate the complex and often controversial moments in the Casa’s history, highlighting figures such as the talented but equivocal Giuseppe Prezzolini and Columbia’s president Nicholas M. Butler, as well as students and community members—both Italian and Italian-American. Read about this exhibition in the Columbia "Record" newspaper.
