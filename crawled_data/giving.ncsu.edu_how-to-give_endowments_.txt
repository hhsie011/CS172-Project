When you create an endowment, you touch the lives of future generations. Your gift is immediately invested and, when fully funded, produces annual income to support the endowment’s purpose for years to come. While cash gifts for current use are vitally important, endowments are the bedrock of all great universities. They provide certain, steady support in perpetuity. Funds invested in NC State endowments help to offset continued reductions in government support and enable us to plan for the future with greater predictability than otherwise possible. There is no better legacy to NC State than a gift of endowment.
