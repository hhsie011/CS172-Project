A list of supported courses is available on the Supported Courses webpage. Group Tutoring Request Group Tutoring The Academic Tutoring Program's overarching goal is to foster inclusive peer-to-peer teaching and learning practices among undergraduate scholars. Our aim is for students to develop a deeper understanding of course content through peer learning groups that foster greater student confidence to succeed in their scholarly work at Brown and beyond. Submit tutoring requests during the Early Request period: Students can submit requests for group tutoring beginning June 21. Group tutoring sessions are scheduled between the hours of 10 a.m. - 10 p.m. ET Sunday-Thursday. We do our best to offer various group sessions, but students may need to alter their schedules to accommodate the available tutoring sessions. Important Dates Summer '22 Semester Requests for tutoring open: June 21 Group Sessions Begin Sunday, June 26 Request tutoring through the online portal, or visit: https://tutoring.apps.brown.edu Last Day to Request Tutoring for Spring 2022: Monday, July 25 Tutoring ends Sunday, July 31 or 24 hours in advance of the release of a final exam, whichever is first. Language Tutoring Small group tutoring is available for introductory and intermediate language courses (level 0100-0400) for Arabic, Chinese, French, Japanese, and Spanish. Students in other language courses are encouraged to meet with their instructors/TAs for extra assistance. If you have questions, please contact Dean Janet Peters, Associate Director of Academic Tutoring & Assistant Dean of Curricular Support. Please note: The Academic Tutoring Program does not support all courses. Tutoring is a weekly commitment. The Tutoring Program does not support private tutoring. Due to the demand for tutoring, students are automatically dropped after two unexcused absences. Students on the waitlist will receive an email when a seat is available.
