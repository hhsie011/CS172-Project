Home / Apply / Application Status custom css-js - global Application Status After you submit your application, you’ll receive an email with information on logging into your Green Wave Portal (application status) and Gibson Online (financial aid). It may take approximately 2 weeks before submitted materials are designated as “received” on your checklist. Check the status of your application to Tulane How we release decisions We release admission decisions as they become available, up to the notification deadline for each application period (December 15th for Early Decision applicants, January 15th for Early Action applicants, and April 1st for Regular Decision applicants). It is important to remember that this means some students will receive their admission decision at different times than others. Therefore, the order in which applicants receive their admission decision is not reflective of the decision itself. Applicants should not assume they have been admitted or denied if they know of someone else that has received a decision before them. Submitting Supplemental Materials You may choose to submit supplemental materials to give us a little more information about you that may strengthen your application. Materials may include things like art supplements, short films, blogs, audio recordings, dance videos, writing samples, or supplemental academic work. You may email additional materials to submit@tulane.edu. Please allow up to ten business days for emailed information to be recorded as received.
