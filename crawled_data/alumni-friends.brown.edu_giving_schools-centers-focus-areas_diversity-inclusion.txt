Now, increasing numbers of the best and brightest researchers, scholars, and students from a full range of backgrounds across the nation are deciding that Brown is the place they want to be. “ We are bringing together exceptionally talented students, faculty, and staff from across the spectrum of human experience, and doing so in ways that increase the impact of our teaching, research, and scholarship. ” Christina H. Paxson President, Brown University By recruiting and retaining faculty from a multitude of backgrounds and experiences—and by increasing resources that enable them to study issues related to equity and the impacts of marginalization—we deepen and broaden the impact and reach of our scholarship. What’s more, by creating a learning community that embodies the social and intellectual diversity of the world, our students gain the skills and insight they need to thrive in today's global marketplace. Top students also see Brown as the place that will prepare them for life after college, and that will support them intellectually and socially. BrownTogether will increase support for academic and programmatic initiatives designed to make sure that all students have access to the many opportunities available. These investments are essential to our core mission of academic excellence. Through BrownTogether, we will strengthen Brown's distinctive and rigorous approach to teaching and research and amplify the University’s impact beyond campus and across the globe. The strength of any institution is its diversity, and for Brown University, diversity and inclusion is not what we do but who we are. The DIAP sets us apart in higher education and is our guiding framework to ensure everyone matters at the University. Sylvia Carey-Butler, Ph.D. Vice President for Institutional Equity and Diversity Support diversity at Brown. Help make our campus truly inclusive and fully diverse by making a gift today.
