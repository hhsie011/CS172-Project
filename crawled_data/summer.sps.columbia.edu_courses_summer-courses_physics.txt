Students are expected to meet pre-requisite requirements prior to registration. Physics S1201 with S1291 laboratory and Physics S1202 with S1292 laboratory constitute a complete one-year course in general physics. These courses are designed primarily for premedical and other preprofessional and liberal arts students. Each laboratory course includes ten three-hour laboratory periods. Physics S1201 and S1202 count toward the science requirement for most Columbia University undergraduates. Check the Directory of Classes for the most up-to-date course information. Summer 2022 Session Information SESSION A (First Half Term) courses are May 23–July 1, 2022 SESSION B (Second Half Term) courses are July 5–August 12, 2022 SESSION X (Full Term) courses are May 23–August 12, 2022 Courses Select Method of Instruction In-Person Select Session Session A Session B X Summer Session Expand All BASIC PHYSICS PHYS0065S001 0 points. Prerequisites: high school mathematics, but not calculus. Basic Physics serves as preparation for General Physics 1201-1202 and is intended for those students who do not have a solid foundation in high school physics or who have been away from school for several years. The course will provide an introduction to the basic concepts and fundamental laws of physics, focusing on mechanics, together with a review of the mathematical techniques needed for problem-solving.
