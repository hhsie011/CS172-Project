Harvard Library's Modern Greek Collection dates back to the early 19th century and attracts researchers from all over the world. Each year we acquire new and unique materials to meet the needs of current faculty and researchers. The collection contains materials in the humanities and social sciences mostly published in Greece and Cyprus. One of the largest and richest collections of its kind outside of Greece, the collection includes recordings, rare books and manuscripts, 19th-century periodicals, first editions of folklore collections, modern authors, poets, and Western travelers. The library also houses a wide range of rare collections in oral literature and folklore studies, created and organized by distinguished Harvard scholars such as F.J. Child, G.L. Kittredge, James Notopoulos, Cedric Whitman, Milman Parry, and Albert B. Lord. In addition to serving as an important historic collection, the Modern Greek Collection is a dynamic one, growing and evolving to support the cross-disciplinary research needs of the Harvard scholarly community and beyond. Accessing These Materials Materials in this collection are searchable via HOLLIS. Having trouble searching in HOLLIS for Greek materials? We use the American Library Association/Library of Congress Romanization Tables. It can be confusing, so please ask for help! The Modern Greek section at Widener Library, Room G-60A, serves as Harvard Library’s contact point for Modern Greek scholars. Rhea K. Lesage, Librarian for Hellenic Studies and Coordinator for the Classics, is available to discuss your research interests. Contact Rhea K.
