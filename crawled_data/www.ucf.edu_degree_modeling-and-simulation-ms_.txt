The UCF School of Modeling, Simulation, and Training (SMST) considers its degree programs as transdisciplinary, intended for those who wish to pursue a career in the fields of academia, government, military/defense, healthcare/medicine, entertainment, technology, education, or service/manufacturing. Most engineering or scientific fields use simulation as an exploration, modeling, or analysis technique. However, Modeling and Simulation is not limited to engineering and science, as it is also used in training, management, and concept exploration. These programs involve constructing human-centered, equipment-centered, and stand-alone computer-based models of existing and conceptual systems and processes. UCF SMST sought feedback from industry practitioners to identify key competencies for students in our degree programs. This input has been critical to the development of our curriculum, which is designed to provide a broad overall perspective of the developing simulation industry and an awareness of the economic considerations. UCF SMST's objective is to provide education on evaluating the human, organization, equipment, and systems under study through the evaluation of output from the corresponding simulation construct. Alumni of SMST degree programs have both general and specialized skills in Modeling and Simulation. Though not required, many students in the Modeling and Simulation M.S. program choose to focus their study and research efforts in an area of specialization. Students can base their specialization on their academic and professional goals, and seek feedback from their faculty adviser and the Modeling and Simulation graduate program director. Common areas of specialization are listed below (descriptions can be found at msgrad.ist.ucf.edu). This is not an exhaustive list, as the field continues to grow and evolve.

The GPS helps the student design an appropriate program of coursework to support the student's educational needs, goals, and objectives. The GPS should be developed in concert with the student's faculty adviser or (if adviser is not yet identified) program director and form a unified cohesive strategy for degree completion. All graduate program credit must be at the 5000-level or higher, with a minimum of 50% at the 6000- or 7000-level.Students are eligible to make changes to their Graduate Plan of Study at any time, with the approval of their faculty adviser and the Modeling and Simulation Graduate Program. Culminating Experience 0 Total Credits Students are eligible to complete their specific culminating experience once they are within 6 credits of completing all coursework (i.e., completed at least 24 credits of coursework); have an approved up-to-date GPS on file with the graduate program; and have an advisory committee on file (thesis students, please refer to the information below; non-thesis students, the advisory committee is selected by the SMST Graduate Program).Detailed information and protocol regarding the culminating experiences can be found at msgrad.ist.ucf.edu. Thesis Adviser and Advisory Committee 0 Total Credits Students are responsible for selecting an adviser from a list of faculty members authorized to direct theses to serve as the chair of their advisory committee. Then, in concert with their adviser, the student must identify and select the remaining members of the advisory committee. The advisory committee must contain a minimum of three members (chair plus two members). All committee members must hold a terminal degree and be in fields related to the student's thesis topic. At least two members, including the chair, must be classified as Modeling and Simulation graduate faculty. These faculty members should be from (or represent) at least two different colleges. At least one member must have served as a committee member on a prior SMST advisory committee. With approval from the Modeling and Simulation Graduate Program Director, a committee member may serve as a committee's co-chair. The UCF College of Graduate Studies, as well as UCF SMST, reserve the right to review appointments to advisory committees; place a representative on any advisory committee; or appoint a co-adviser. Thesis Defense 0 Total Credits The thesis defense is a formal oral presentation of the written project before the student's advisory committee. All dissertation defenses are announced in advance and open to the public. Committee members vote either "Pass" or "Fail" of the written thesis and oral defense. The thesis and its defense must be approved by a majority vote, with no more than one dissenting vote. Normally, students are granted one opportunity to pass the thesis defense. In extenuating circumstances and at the discretion of the Modeling and Simulation Graduate Program Director, a student may be allowed one additional attempt to pass the thesis defense (no more than two attempts will be allowed).Non-thesis Experience An advisory committee comprised of 2-3 members of the UCF SMST Core Curriculum committee identifies a non-thesis capstone project. The current requirement is a professional portfolio, highlighting a student's educational and professional skills, reflecting the discipline in which the student plans to pursue their Modeling and Simulation career. The details and standards for the project will be presented in IDS6916, but the student has until their last semester to submit their final portfolio. Students who declare an intent to graduate with the non-thesis option will be enrolled in a portfolio webcourse and invited to participate in workshops to receive feedback prior to the announced deadline. Portfolios are graded "Pass" or "Fail." Normally, a student is granted one opportunity to pass the requirement. In extenuating circumstances and at the discretion of the Modeling and Simulation Graduate Program Director, a student may be allowed one additional attempt to pass the non-thesis project requirement (no more than two attempts will be allowed). Time to Completion 0 Total Credits Students are granted 7 years (21 semesters) from the term of admission to complete their degree program. Failure to comply with the "7-Year Rule" may result in dismissal from the program, and may require reapplication to the program as well as repeating coursework and other program requirements. Equipment Fee 0 Total Credits Full-time students in the Modeling and Simulation MS program pay a $27 equipment fee each semester that they are enrolled. Part-time students pay a $13.50 equipment fee each semester that they are enrolled. Independent Learning 0 Total Credits A thesis serves as the independent learning experience for thesis students. Nonthesis students are required to take IDS 6916 where a research project is required and submit an end-of-program portfolio.
