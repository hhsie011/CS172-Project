The screening will take place within the context of the Columbia Global Seminar: Byzantine and Modern Greek Encounters, a unique semester-long course taught by Professors Martha Howell and Karen Van Dyck at Bogazici University. Cine-forum: “America America” directed by Elia Kazan, 1963  Featuring: Prof. Karen Van Dyck (Hellenic Studies, Classics, Columbia University) Date and time: April 28, 2015 at 18:00 – 21:00  Venue: Zografyon Greek High School  Address: Turnacıbası Sk. No: 27 Beyoglu – Istanbul How is Orientalism defined as other than Greek? What does it mean for a Greek-American woman Demetra Vaka Brown to write about Turkish women in the 1910s and 20s? How might we reconsider nationalism and hybrid identity through the prism of Greco-Ottomanism? What does Kazan mean by Anatolian? How are Armenian and Greek identities blurred in his films and novels? Why does the film title repeat America twice? If East met West when Greeks left Anatolia and Greece for America from the 1880s on, what happens when Greece becomes the West for Balkan immigrants since the 1980s? How are the cases of Vaka Brown and Kazan useful in thinking about the different ways that literature and film use Greece as a comparative case?
