She received her B.S. degree in Materials Science and Computer Science from Tsinghua University and her Ph.D. degree in Materials Science from Caltech. She spent the next 12 years working at the General Motors R&D Center. At GM, she developed multi-scale models starting from the atomistic level to solve engineering problems related to lightweight alloys, fuel cells, and batteries. She transitioned from industry to academia in 2013 and served on the faculty in the Chemical Engineering and Materials Science Department at Michigan State University till 2020. Professor Qi and her “Materials Simulation for Clean Energy” Lab develop multi-scale simulations methods to design materials atom by atom. All of the materials she studied are critically important for an energy-efficient and sustainable future. She is passionate about increasing diversity in Engineering and was the inaugurate Associate Dean for Inclusion and Diversity in the College of Engineering at MSU between 2018-2020.
