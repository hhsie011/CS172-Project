Whereas, ordinary costs of a course are expected to be borne by the department offering the course. Applicable course fees are listed with the specific course in the Schedule of Classes . Course fees also appear on each student’s schedule detail available on AccessPlus. Delivery fees: Some ISU departments and colleges charge delivery fee in addition to tuition. Delivery fees support the additional people and infrastructure for some distance education programs. Applicable fees are listed with the course section in the online schedule of classes. For Staff: Processes and Procedures The approval process on AccessPlus. Authorization, publication, collection Fee types Adds and changes Experimental Courses: How to authorize Course Fee Manual Course Fee Policy Authorization In order to charge a course fee (SCF), the department head must submit a formal request to the college dean using the Course Fee Authorization system in AccessPlus. During the approval process, the Accounts Receivable Office will assign a selling agency number and the Office of the Registrar will load the course fee type and amount into the catalog and appropriate section records using an automated process. At the beginning of a new catalog year, departments will receive a list of existing course fees (SCF) from the offices of Accounts Receivable and the Registrar. Course fees will need to be reauthorized for each new catalog year. The Course Fee Authorization needs approval only once for a particular course during any catalog year, and will remain in force until the next catalog cycle. However, if a fee increase or change in fee description (intended use) is desired during a catalog cycle, a Course Fee Revision Authorization form must be submitted and approved. Deadlines for getting authorization for a new course fee are: Fall and summer semesters: March 1 Spring semester: October 1 Publication of Course Fees Students will be notified of course fees in the Web Schedule of Classes on AccessPlus. Courses with a course fee will have a note that includes a description of the course fee and the amount of the fee. The amount can be fixed or variable. If variable, the note will indicate the fee range. Collection of Course Fees The Accounts Receivable Office will collect course fees on behalf of the departments. Collected fees are deposited bi-monthly in the appropriate department fund account. As part of the authorization process, the department designates a course fee coordinator to oversee the billing process for all the department's courses that have course fees. When a new coordinator is appointed, his/her name and contact information should be forwarded to the Accounts Receivable Office and to the Office of the Registrar.
