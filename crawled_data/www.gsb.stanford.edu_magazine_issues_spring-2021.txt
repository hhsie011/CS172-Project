Stanford Business Magazine All Issues Spring 2021 Spring 2021 Issue Explore the Spring 2021 issue of Stanford Business magazine — and see how people from all corners of the Stanford GSB community are coming together to change lives, organizations, and the world. Dean’s Letter Stanford GSB and Sustainability Sustainability and climate change are becoming topics that no business leader can ignore. Agents of Growth How Stanford Seed deploys alumni to lift the global economy. Editor’s Note Happy Accidents We love it when the universe conspires to make us look smarter than we are. As we were putting the final touches on this issue of Stanford Business magazine, someone pointed out that it contains a trio of long-form articles that align with the three pillars of the school’s motto: “Change Lives, Change Organizations, Change the World.” “Give Them Shelter” tells the story of a team of GSB alumni who are tackling the homeless crisis in San Francisco and beyond. The cornerstone of their audacious plan is already under construction: a six-story stack of cozy, prefabricated micro-studios that will soon change the lives of hundreds of people, many of whom now live on the streets. “Green Giants” highlights alumni who are working in a variety of ways — and largely behind the scenes — to decarbonize the economy and prevent cataclysmic climate change. By focusing on non-glamorous but pivotal sectors such as risk management and private equity, they are looking to change organizations in fundamental ways, all with an eye toward saving the planet. Our cover story, “Agents of Growth,” focuses on two companies — one in Kenya, the other in India — that have been nurtured by Stanford Seed, the school’s transformative, international executive-training program. Seed enlists and deploys alumni, faculty, students, and staff to teach promising entrepreneurs in developing countries how to scale their businesses. The goal is to create jobs, boost local economies, and reverse the global cycle of poverty. In other words, change the world. If we’d spotted that obvious thematic thread earlier in our production process, we might have packaged those articles together more conspicuously, and you, dear reader, never would have known what we’re about to confess here: that a lot of the best work that gets done in these pages results from happy accidents. — The Editors Show More Jaqueline Novogratz, MBA ’91: What Matters to Me Now and Why “I have had to learn to fight bureaucracy, corruption, and complacency — skills I hadn’t considered at business school.” Hard Lesson: In Sports, the Clientele Cares About One Thing… Winning Joe Lacob, MBA ’83, looks back on the night he got booed into silence by his customers.

Green Giants: Five Stanford GSB Alumni Quietly Pulling Levers to Save the Planet Forget about electric cars and meatless meat: Mounting a serious response to climate change requires inventive work in less-glamorous sectors such as risk management and private equity. Peer to Peer: How Do I Foster a Racially Equitable Firm? Members of the Stanford MBA Class of ’94 drew up a playbook for business leaders looking to promote racial equity. Back to Class: Corporations, Finance, and Governance in the Global Economy A pair of Stanford GSB professors use movies, skits, and Saturday Night Live-style cold opens to teach the “broad and deep applicability of finance.” Zombies on the Rise A decade of binge borrowing has turned many corporations into the walking dead, Stanford finance experts say. Office Artifact: Szu-chi Huang’s Reproduction of a Harold Weston Painting How a professor’s love of art led her to a career in marketing research.

First, you have to believe it can be fixed. Home Foreclosures Can Have Devastating, Long-Term Impacts A new study finds that the repercussions of home loss extend to crime, divorce, and even student test scores.
