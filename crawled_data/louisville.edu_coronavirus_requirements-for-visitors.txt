University officials continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation and will inform the community about changes to policies, procedures and activities related to the university’s virus protection and response efforts. Our top priority is keeping our Cardinal family safe and all visitors are expected to adhere to UofL's seven Health and Safety Protocols. Additionally, all visitors must complete the Visitor Symptom Questionnaire prior to participating in an event or meeting on campus, on the day of its occurrence. Future Cardinals have the option of doing either virtual or in-person visits, and many university events have a virtual option. Categories Planning your trip to campus When on campus Mask exception for speakers Requirements for hosts Planning your trip to campus Confirm your intentions to visit campus with a university representative. For help with identifying the appropriate person about your visit, contact UofL’s Business Operations COVID Support Team. If you are planning to visit UofL from a location outside of Kentucky (including Southern Indiana), please determine the positivity rate of your location. According to our governor’s travel advisory, all travelers coming from a state with a 15% or higher positivity rate should quarantine for 14 days upon their arrival to Kentucky. Thus, UofL is not permitting visitors from states with 15% or higher positive rates, or countries with Level 3 warnings*. If your purpose for visiting campus is admissions-related, please see the Admissions Visitors webpage for specific details on admissions visits and tours. Please bring a mask with you. Please note that any masks or face coverings with a plastic one-way valve without filtering are prohibited. Face shields may not be worn in lieu of a mask but may be worn in addition to a mask. Prior to arrival on our campus, please confirm the following**: You are not feeling sick, and you are not showing symptoms of COVID-19. In the last 14 days, you have not been in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. You have not had a fever within the last 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication. *If you are an out-of-state visitor who will still be in Kentucky after your 14 days of quarantine, and you do not exhibit any symptoms of COVID-19 at the end of that time, you may proceed in planning your trip to campus with a university representative. **If any of these situations are not true for you, we regret to inform you that you may not visit campus at this time. Back to the top When on campus By stepping onto UofL’s campus, you are confirming the following: You are aware of our Health and Safety Protocols. You are not feeling sick, and you are not showing symptoms of COVID-19. In the last 14 days, you have not been in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. You have not had a fever within the last 24 hours without the use of fever reducing medication. Complete the Visitor Symptom Questionnaire prior to participating in your event or meeting on the day of its occurrence. Please follow UofL’s seven Health and Safety Protocols at all times during your visit. Before entering campus buildings, mass transit and healthcare settings on campus, visitors must put on their masks. Visitors should practice physical distancing whenever possible. Masks may be removed while eating or drinking on campus. As soon as the meal is complete, however, please wash your hands (or use hand sanitizer), put your mask back on, then sanitize your hands again. Please stay accompanied by your host for the duration of your visit. Back to the top Mask exception for speakers If a visitor will be addressing a group or camera for a speaking engagement, that individual is permitted to remove their mask just for the duration of the speaking engagement if they can maintain 6 feet or more from others. All other individuals in the area of that speaker should continue wearing their masks. Back to the top Requirements for hosts When possible, events and meetings should have a virtual option to continue taking precautions during the pandemic. If it is decided that an event or meeting should occur in person and visitors will be involved with that event or meeting, a university member must act as a host to the visitors. Visitors at the University of Louisville are defined as any individual who is not currently a student, faculty, or staff member. University members who must host a visitor— such as a guest, speaker, job candidate, visiting professor, visiting seminar group, news team, or others who are not current university members—should do the following: Identify the locations from which each visitor will be coming to campus. For out-of-state visitors, determine the state-wide positivity rate or the international warning level of those locations. If the visitor is coming directly from a state with a 15% or higher positivity rate or a Warning Level 3 country, they are not permitted to come to campus. This is in accordance with our governor’s travel advisory which indicates that travelers from such locations should quarantine for 14 days upon arrival to Kentucky. Collect the full names and contact information for each visitor* planning to come to campus. This is for contact tracing purposes in the event that Campus Health needs this information quickly. On the day of the event, the host should confirm the following with each visitor prior to their arrival**: They are not feeling sick and they are not showing symptoms of COVID-19. In the last 14 days, they have not been in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. They have not had a fever within the last 24 hours without the use of fever reducing medication. They have completed the Visitor Symptom Questionnaire. The host is responsible for providing masks for visitors that arrive to our campus without one. The host is responsible for ensuring visitors stay accompanied by a university member for the duration of their visit. The host is responsible for ensuring the event or meeting space is set up in a way that allows for all visitors and attendees to be six feet apart in addition to wearing their masks. *Admissions may continue following their current process of only gathering the student visitor’s contact information. **Visitors who report they are exhibiting any of these things must be asked to stay home and are not permitted to be on campus. *** The answers to this questionnaire go directly to Campus Health staff.
