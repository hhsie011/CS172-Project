Introduction Columbia University is committed to compliance with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to the compromise of Sensitive Data (as such term is defined in the Columbia University Information Security Charter (the “Charter”)). This Policy establishes measures that must be taken to report and respond to a possible breach or compromise of Sensitive Data, including the determination of the Systems affected, whether any Sensitive Data have in fact been compromised, what specific Sensitive Data were compromised and what actions are required for forensic investigation and legal compliance. The University’s HIPAA Breach Investigation and Reporting Policy supplements this Policy and should be complied with if the possible breach or compromise of Sensitive Data relates to PHI. Capitalized terms used herein without definition are defined in the Charter. II. Policy History The effective date of this Policy is November 1, 2013. This Policy replaces the University’s Electronic Data Security Breach Reporting and Response Policy, dated February 14, 2007, as amended in May 2011 and June 2013, and the CUIMC Privacy and Information Security Incident Procedure and Breach Notification Policy, dated November 2007, as amended in January and April 2013.

This expanded URT will be responsible for the investigation of the incident and any technical support required. Incident team members will include representatives of affected Data Owners and any other units responsible for the Information Resources involved. Any individual responsible for an Information Resource containing Sensitive Data that may have been compromised must take immediate steps to secure that system and preserve it without change.
