Inclement Weather Policy: In the case of inclement weather, Baylor Law will follow the same opening/closing schedule as the main Baylor University campus. If classes or exams are canceled or delayed, the local media outlets will be contacted by 7:00 a.m., and they will announce the closing or delay. We will attempt to post the closing/delay our web page and to notify all students by email and social media as soon as possible. If classes are not cancelled, but a particular professor needs to cancel a class, we will attempt to notify students by email. If classes are not cancelled, students are expected to use good judgment to determine if they can safely drive to Baylor Law. We care about the safety of our students and we expect each student to make a prudent decision about attendance in inclement weather.
