OSMM supports all Cornell students of all religious identities, ethical backgrounds, and worldviews in discovering what they deeply believe, finding places of spiritual belonging, and growing into the people they feel called to become. OSMM also supports CURW, a multi-faith consortium of affiliated campus ministers - who offer additional spiritual support, programming, and service opportunities. CURW coordinates the programs of the major religious traditions that have a presence at Cornell. Each week during the academic year, CURW hosts Catholic masses, Hindu prayers, Jewish services (Reform, Conservative and Orthodox), Muslim prayers, and Protestant worship services in Anabel Taylor Hall and Sage Chapel. COVID-19 Update Visit Cornellâ€™s coronavirus webpage for the most current campus updates and FAQs. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, some religious services & events are happening online while other are happening in person. Please check the websites of each organization to learn more. Get Involved in OSMM There are many ways to find a place to belong at Cornell. Some students find their place through their faith, whether deepening existing beliefs or finding the opportunity to discover their spiritual self in new ways. Learn how to connect with OSMM & CURW programs here. In addition to the support and programming available directly through OSMM, there are many registered student organizations on campus under the category "religious." Search the undergraduate or graduate student organizations. What Guides Our Work? Each affiliated chaplaincy is guided by its own sacred texts as well as other covenants made with their sponsoring religious organization or denomination. OSMM is also guided by statements that convey our guiding principles. Our primary document is the University's mission statement. Other supportive documents include: Religious Accommodation Policy Cornell University has an enduring commitment to supporting religious diversity. As part of this commitment, the university will make good faith efforts to provide reasonable accommodations for religious observance for employees and students.
