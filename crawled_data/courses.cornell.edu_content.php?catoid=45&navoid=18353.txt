Explore the data on their Graduation and Degrees Conferred page to see degrees conferred; graduation rates for first-time freshmen and transfers as well as by college, race/citizenship and sex; and year-to-year persistence/retention among different cohorts. Cornell Career Services surveys bachelor’s degree recipients for six months following graduation, and produces a report summarizing postgraduate activities for the university as a whole including employment, graduate school, and other endeavors. In addition, graduate degree recipients in three colleges—AAP, Engineering, and ILR—complete the survey, with results produced in their respective college career offices. View recent surveys.
