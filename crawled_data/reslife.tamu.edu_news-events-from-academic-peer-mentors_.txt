Plan the harder topics first and then the easier ones after. This will allow for more time to fully understand the harder topics! Do a quick review the night before and get a good night’s sleep. Eat a nutritious breakfast on the day of the exam and make sure you have all the necessary materials to take your exam. Good luck! Everyone has a preferred learning style. Some prefer visuals, while others prefer listening. What is yours? Complete the VARK assessment. Once you complete it, come by our offices at Hullabaloo 125 or Commons 102 during our office hours to pick up a free sticker! When picking up the sticker, just show the email of your VARK results to the Academic Peer Mentor.
