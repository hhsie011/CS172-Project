CoC Decision Tree: Is my NIH research subject to a CoC? Principal Investigator (PI) CoC Responsibilities Treat ALL information about individuals involved in NIH funded research as if a CoC applies Modify, if the study is modified If the collection of data continues after the award, apply to extend CoC protection Review & follow guidance for Sharing/Disclosing CoC Protected Information.

Important points about certificates: Permanent protection. The data collected while your NIH funding is active is permanently protected, even after your funding has ended and your study has been completed. Protection is tied to your funding. Any data collected after your NIH funding ends is not protected unless you apply to extend the CoC past your funding expiration date. Consent requirement. Subjects must be informed about the CoC. Researcher responsibilities. PIs are responsible for complying with the terms of the CoC. The NIH CoC Kiosk also provides extensive information.
