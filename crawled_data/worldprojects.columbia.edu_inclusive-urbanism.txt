The report, which emerged from a series of working groups convened by CWP, summarizes the meetings and outlines concrete recommendations to empower residents to engage city government and to cultivate more responsive structures of governance.

Shaun Donovan and Kate Orff Discuss Rebuild by Design Columbia World Projects invited Shaun Donovan, the former United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; and Kate Orff, an Associate Professor at Columbia GSAPP, the Director of GSAPP’s Urban Design Program, and the founder of SCAPE studio, to discuss how we might design successful, inclusive urban planning interventions in an era of climate crisis. Overview and Background Columbia World Projects’ (CWP) research and engagement work on inclusive urbanism explores the conditions under which communities throughout cities achieve social, economic and political inclusion. By developing a comparative understanding of the ecological, social and political forces that shape urban space, our work encourages effective problem-solving, participatory approaches, and fresh collective-thinking among experts. We work in partnership with government, civic organizations, nonprofits and academic researchers to produce reports and develop communities of practice that advocate for and, in some cases, implement recommendations that emerge from our work. To that end, we organize both working groups and initiatives (clusters of several working groups focused on a single theme). These groups meet regularly and bring together researchers, policymakers and practitioners to address pressing issues facing municipal governments and city residents. On occasion, we organize standalone working groups to explore issues of immediate concern. Details on work underway, and plans for future activity, are below. Beirut Recovery This initiative examines questions about how to center the needs of local communities in the reconstruction of Beirut following the port explosion on August 4, 2020. The blast exposed and amplified already existing vulnerabilities present in the areas affected, including increased displacements of residents, uncontrolled gentrification, growing inequality, neglected infrastructure and an absence of effective public agencies and public spaces. In a series of working group meetings organized in partnership with local institutions, global experts and leaders from international organizations, the initiative outlines priorities and principles to underlie reconstruction. It then identifies and recommends concrete interventions that should be taken up by international organizations involved in reconstruction efforts, by the government of Lebanon, and by NGOs working on reconstruction efforts. Working groups within this initiative focus on particular topics related to the recovery, including reconstruction of heritage sites, housing and land use, the port and economic priorities, the management of recovery funds and the activation of public space. These working groups, meeting throughout 2020 and 2021, are organized in partnership with the Beirut Urban Lab at the American University of Beirut. Reports detailing participants’ recommendations will be released in the coming months. Heritage and Reconstruction This working group focuses on how to involve residents in historic preservation efforts, what counts as heritage and how to memorialize the disaster. Participants also explore how to unlock funding for these efforts.

The working group explores these issues in the context of high vacancy rates, the financialization of housing and land and how innovative land use strategies, including land banking and land value capture, can provide increased funding for social housing and good housing stock.

Participants highlight possible scenarios including total or partial reconstruction of the port, and take into account existing geopolitical and economic challenges. They outline methods of reconstruction that would make the port competitive and support the public good while also enhancing environmental and economic sustainability for communities.

Because of the absence of robust leadership from the state, distrust in government is rampant, and international and local non-governmental organizations have assumed responsibility for much of the provision of social and urban services in the wake of the explosion. Participants seek to understand to whom resources should be distributed, and how they should be coordinated and evaluated to best serve those affected by the blast, rather than sectarian agendas or regional and global interests not in line with the most pressing needs of local residents.

The group explores how to create places that are accessible and livable through the design of urban forms, landscaping and the establishment of public art spaces in order to involve communities in the improvement of their built environment.

The initiative works to map the field of civic technology and explore both gaps and opportunities for adoption, advise New York City's newly-created Civic Engagement Commission and contribute to a series of reports that detail how government agencies can increase civic trust and leverage digital tools to enliven civic engagement. An initial working group within this initiative met in April 2020 and brought together leading researchers in digital platforms and civic engagement alongside donors, practitioners and policymakers. In summer 2020, the research and engagement team assembled two additional working groups, one that brought together participants from across Europe to discuss local experiments with digital civic engagement efforts, and another that focused specifically on the use of Decidim, a platform adopted by New York’s Civic Engagement Commission in December 2020.

The initiative also examines how the COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped cities, giving rise to new coalitions related to housing and infrastructure, service provision and advocacy. Members of the initiative first met in July 2020 and gather on a recurring basis.

Participants included a range of academics and professionals from around the world whose work centers on the particular challenges facing delta and river cities in the era of climate change. They explored prospects for restoring resiliency to both the natural and built environment in places of dense habitation, enormous inequality and extreme fragility. Participants drew from both the physical and social sciences, as well as from areas of professional specialization, including law, urban design and planning. They thought creatively about how to shape more just landscapes, green infrastructure and inclusive societies. The convening included discussions about the common challenges that delta cities need to overcome in order to build resilience and adapt in an era of rapid environmental and climate change.

An ethics of the city aims to draw together disparate communities to encourage exchange and prompt recognition of the fundamental fault lines that emerge among communities of strangers. Participants studied how the most vulnerable city residents live as citizens making claims, asserting rights and seeking dignity in the face of structures of wealth, power and hardened inequalities.
