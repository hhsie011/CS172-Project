At the same time, copyright law recognizes that the impetus to create is based on the ability to access already existing expressions of intellectual creativity and use them as platforms upon which we create anew. In addition, copyright law also provides mechanisms that allow us to use existing expressions of ideas to voice opinion, criticism, and dissent. A New Era in Scholarly Communications Academic Scholarship is based upon the capacity to create and distribute ideas. Most often these ideas have been captured and recorded, whether as literary works in traditional formats, or with the advent of technologies, in multiple electronic formats, and even as re-contextualized popular content that is examined from a scholarly perspective. How do faculty and students keep abreast of the application of copyright law to these new ways of communicating scholarly content?
