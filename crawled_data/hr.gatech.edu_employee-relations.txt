Unemployment insurance is temporary income for workers who are unemployed through no fault of their own. The funding for unemployment insurance benefits comes from taxes paid by employers. Employees do not pay any costs. Eligibility Eligibility for benefits is determined based on past wages, reason for job separation, availability, and job search requirements. Hearing Process Managers/supervisors who are involved in a hearing for a contested unemployment claim should contact their HR representative. *Courtesy of Georgia Department of Labor - Unemployment Filing a Claim Claims for unemployment insurance may be filed at any Georgia Department of Labor career center.
