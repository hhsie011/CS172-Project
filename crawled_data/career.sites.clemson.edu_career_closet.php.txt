What is the Career Closet? The Career Closet program was developed to provide a way for Clemson students to obtain clothing for job hunting. The clothing provided ranges from business casual to business professional attire. All of our clothing comes from donations given by members of the Clemson community. In addition to providing clothing, we also offer tips and interviewing advice at the Michelin Career Center to help build your professional brand. Previous Next Where is it? Clemson's Career Closet is located in room 166 of the Undergraduate Student Government Office. The Student Government Office is located in the Edgar Brown Student Union. Who is it for? Any Undergraduate or Graduate students may use the Career Closet. Students will be allowed to choose up to two items per semester, free of charge. Depending on inventory these numbers may change to accommodate for a higher demand. How does it work? Currently enrolled Undergraduate and Graduate students can come by during these times with an official Clemson University Student ID to complete the check-out process. The Career Closet is drop-in style meaning no appointment is needed, and students will be served on a first come first serve basis. Please note that there could be a 20-30 minute wait. Hours Due to COVID-19 we ask you to please wear a mask and practice social distancing while in the closet.
