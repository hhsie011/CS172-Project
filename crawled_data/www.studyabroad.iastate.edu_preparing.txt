For Iowa State students travelling abroad, you will find information on selecting courses and transferring credit back, staying healthy and safe while abroad, what is expected of students when they travel abroad through Iowa State, and information on conduct and harassment. There is also information on handling money, packing, traveling around, applying for a passport, and culture shock/adjustment. As you return home, don’t forget to prepare for that transition! For some students, the re-adjustment back into their previous life and routine can be more challenging than the adjustment to their host culture abroad. This section of the website will provide you with information on how to use and talk about your international experience. You can also learn about ways to engage with the international community in Ames and share your stories with others. It won’t be long until you will be looking for your next journey abroad!
