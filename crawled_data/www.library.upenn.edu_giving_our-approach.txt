The Penn Libraries’ Office of Advancement upholds this rich, 250-year old tradition of giving in support of information resources and the diverse infrastructure – including spaces, talent and technology – that guides students and scholars through their journeys of discovery. The Office of Advancement strives to increase awareness and support of information resources, programs, spaces and other initiatives at the Libraries in celebration of our history, our present and our future. Areas of giving include information or materials acquisitions, digitization, conservation, capital projects and annual giving. The fundraising and outreach is supported at the highest level by a Board of Overseers. The team also includes a communications program that is twofold: to encourage constituents’ engagement with the Libraries’ mission and to inform and engage faculty, students and the scholarly community outside Penn and at Peer Libraries.
