This licensed software has been procured to assist Clemson University users with their daily computing tasks. We may keep titles on the list for 2 years or more after the license has expired because in many cases activating the license again only requires a maintenance fee versus the full product price. We want our users to know that this is an option if they see it on the list before purchasing. Please click on individual titles for more information. Many software products are available for all faculty, staff, and students to use. Some, however, are designated for specific college or group use. In the cases where a license is designated as "network" (as opposed to "standalone"), that designation refers to whether or not the license is tied to an on-campus license server. The standalone version of the license will be the better install option for laptops that may be used from on- or off-campus; the network license will be appropriate for desktop or departmental machines. Most titles listed below require a license to be purchased or require the user to be a member of the group that owns the software. If you need a particular piece of software and don't see it on the software list below or want more information about a title, you can inquire by sending an email to licensing@clemson.edu. This will generate a ticket to track your issue. You'll receive an update to your ticket instructing you how to download the software in question or in some cases, you may be directed to your area consultant for installation. If you need to purchase a license, please include the desired title, quantity, and end user's username. The Licensing group maintains a network Software Repository of the most widely used applications. Click on a title below for instructions on accessing the Repository. Depending upon your group membership, some applications may be listed as Restricted Use on the Repository. These are generally titles purchased by a specific College, department, or research group and access to the install media for these titles will be limited to IT support personnel who can facilitate the install process for you. The IT Contracts and Licensing group works closely with all groups involved in the licensing process to ensure your needs are met. Please be sure to read the instructions for installation in the Documentation folder of each software folder in the Software Repository. This documentation will in most cases guide you through the successful installation of your software. A small collection of software is available for current faculty, staff, and students of Clemson University at download.clemson.edu. # 365 (Microsoft) 3DS Max (Autodesk) @ @RISK (Palisade) A Abaqus (Dassault Systemes / SIMULIA) Abaqus for Research (Dassault Systemes / SIMULIA) Abaqus for Teaching (Dassault Systemes / SIMULIA) Acrobat Pro (Adobe) Adams (MSC Software) - Chris Paredis Adams (MSC Software) - Srikanth Pilla,Trae King Adams (MSC Software) - Venkat Krovi,Chris Paredis,Trae King Adobe Acrobat Pro (Adobe) Adobe After Affects (Adobe) Adobe Animate (Adobe) Adobe Audition (Adobe) Adobe Bridge (Adobe) Adobe CC (Adobe) Adobe Character Animator (Adobe) Adobe Creative Cloud (Adobe) Adobe Dimension (Adobe) Adobe Dreamweaver (Adobe) Adobe Fuse (Beta) (Adobe) Adobe Garamond Pro font (Adobe) Adobe Illustrator (Adobe) Adobe inCopy (Adobe) Adobe InDesign (Adobe) Adobe Lightroom (Adobe) Adobe Lightroom Classic (Adobe) Adobe Media Encoder (Adobe) Adobe Muse (Adobe) Adobe Photoshop (Adobe) Adobe Prelude (Adobe) Adobe Premiere Pro (Adobe) Adobe Sign (Adobe) Adobe Spark (Adobe) Adobe Story Plus (Adobe) Adobe XD (Adobe) AdvantEdge (Third Wave Systems) After Effects (Adobe) Agilent (Keysight Technologies) Alias Automotive (Autodesk) Altera (Altera) Alteryx Designer (Alteryx) AMPL (ILOG) AMPL (Gurobi Optimization) Animate (Adobe) AnsoftLinks (ANSYS, Inc.)
