The purposes of this culminating course are to (1) give students an opportunity to see how the disciplinary knowledge acquired in their various courses and departmental major programs can be integrated in a synthetic manner; (2) provide a forum for an in-depth evaluation of a significant environmental policy problem; and (3) give students the experience of working as a project team toward the solution of a real-world problem. Considerable fieldwork may be involved, and the final examination consists of a public presentation and defense of the student-generated policy recommendations. To satisfy the culminating experience we will restrict the course to juniors and seniors and we will require each student to produce an individual written report on their contribution to the combined group report so we can more directly assess individual achievement. ENVS 84: Seminar on Environmental Issues of Southern Africa Students on the Africa Foreign Study Program, working in small sub-groups, will undertake multidisciplinary studies of specific regional environmental issues in southern Africa. ENVS 85: Land, Love & Kinship: A Seminar on Indigenous Environmental Knowledges Taking a global perspective, this course will discuss the roles that Indigenous knowledges play in the contemporary world, paying particular attention to how Indigenous knowledge holders enact, tend, and build their environmental knowledges through active and moral relationships with land, water, plants, animals, and other beings. We will examine how key concepts like kinship and relational accountability have developed within Indigenous studies as ways of understanding the relational, embodied, and spiritual nature of Indigenous environmental knowledge. ENVS 91: Thesis Research in ENVS A candidate for the Honors Program must satisfy the minimum College GPA Requirement and complete ENVS 91, or a similar research course approved by the Chair. ENVS 91 may be taken two terms but may only once count toward the major. Please see Internships and Grants for funding sources.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Environmental Studies Undergraduate Overview Major and Minors Culminating Experience ENVS 50 Archive Minor Tracks Courses Sample Syllabi Waitlists and Applications Transfer Term Credit Honors Recent Honors Theses Learning Outcomes Graduate Foreign Study Overview Africa FSP Syllabi and Documents Paulson Fellowships Research Overview Student Research and Internships Faculty Research Fields Hornig Library of Environmental Studies Community Overview Careers Alumni Stories Office of Sustainability Dartmouth Organic Farm Sustainability Solutions Café Past Café Events News & Events News & Events Past Events Archive People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
