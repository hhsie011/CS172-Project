It goes beyond a transcript to include description of any content that is only presented visually. This allows individuals who are blind or visually impaired to understand what is happening in the video or performance. Audio description is generally provided on a separate audio track. If you are creating the video yourself, consider when you are filming ways to avoid the need for audio description by perhaps including a description of visual elements in the script for your video. If you find that you are creating or purchasing a video that needs audio description, you can out source the creation of that audio track with one of the vendors on this list compiled by the American Council of the Blind. Further you might consider becoming an audio describer yourself for videos or live theater events. Contact the Audio Reader Network at reader@ku.edu for information about future trainings.
