The 124-credit-hour, interdisciplinary Chemistry with Teaching BS degree is offered through Temple’s innovative TUteach program. Chemistry is the study of matter and its properties, and it addresses a number of topics involved with the formation of chemical compounds between atoms and molecules. It has played a significant role in new discoveries that impact the advancement of modern science. These include the chemical composition of rocks and soil amid environmental pollution, chemical properties of new medications, and the growth and support of plant life. Graduates are prepared to transfer their knowledge of chemistry to young students and help them form an interest in the discipline. Chemistry with Teaching You’ll get real-world experience to meet a growing need for impactful chemistry teachers with supervised teaching apprenticeships in Philadelphia School District classrooms. Through TUteach courses, you’ll learn how to be successful in the classroom, how to develop inquiry-based lesson plans, and effectively communicate with and teach others. Classes take place in both the College of Science and Technology and the College of Education and Human Development, preparing you to understand how students learn and form ideas about science, how to create an inclusive classroom and how communities affect classroom settings. As a major in the Chemistry Program, you’ll gain hands-on laboratory experience to guide your chemical research. The in-depth coursework emphasizes analytical chemistry, biochemistry, inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry and physical chemistry. You’ll learn to apply inquiry-based teaching through real-world experience; know material from foundational coursework in four out of five subdivisions of chemical research; research chemical literature; solve problems and develop testable hypotheses; and write a scientific report, analyze data and understand the results in a broader scientific context. The curriculum also prepares you to apply your chemistry background to the classroom. You’ll guide students in developing a curiosity for science and an understanding of the function of atoms and molecules, helping shape their STEM education. You’ll also be prepared to teach chemistry across many different behaviors and learning styles, as well as across secondary-school grade levels. A TUteach advisor will help you fulfill curriculum requirements and submit the documents necessary to become a candidate for taking the Praxis exam. The required Praxis exam assesses the skills and knowledge of all individuals preparing to become teachers for kindergarten through grade 12. The Praxis exam you take depends on the state in which you want to become licensed and the scientific discipline you want to teach. Temple TUteach TUteach is a collaboration between the College of Science and Technology and the College of Education and Human Development. TUteach integrates a secondary school (grades 7 through 12) mathematics or science teaching track so you can become eligible to take the Praxis certification exam upon graduation. Learn more about the TUteach program degrees. The TUteach coursework also incorporates the fundamentals of chemistry. Students will learn about the compounds of atoms (elements), combinations of atoms (molecules), and the structure and behavior of atoms. Graduates can pursue careers teaching chemistry in private and public schools, teach abroad, or enter graduate degree programs in STEM, or they can go on to work in curriculum development and research. Classes & Curriculum As a major in the Chemistry with Teaching BS, you will broaden your knowledge with a combination of required and elective courses. The curriculum for the Chemistry with Teaching BS includes 14 required chemistry courses, 7 required College of Education and Human Development courses, and 5 mathematics and physics courses. Learn more about the required and elective courses in the Chemistry with Teaching Major.
