federal government, funds from the state of North Carolina, and institutional funds from NC State. Students do not need to apply separately for grants. They are considered automatically based on the information in their completed Free Application Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Federal Grants Federal Pell Grant – Offered to students with significant financial need, as measured by a congressionally established need-analysis formula that measures a family’s ability to pay for educational expenses. Important: The maximum number of years a student may receive a Federal Pell Grant is the “equivalent of six years.” For information on how to calculate the “equivalent of six years,” visit the Federal Student Aid website. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) – Offered to students with exceptional financial need; Federal Pell grant recipients are given first priority. Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant – Offered to students whose parent or guardian was a member of the U.S. armed forces and died as a result of military service performed in Iraq or Afghanistan after the events of 9/11. Students must be under 24 years old or enrolled in college at least part-time at the time of their parent or guardian’s death. Children of Fallen Heroes Scholarship – Offered to Pell Grant eligible students whose parent or guardian was a public safety officer or fire police officer and died in the line of duty. Students must be under 24 years old or enrolled in college at least part-time at the time of their parent or guardian’s death. State Grant funds for North Carolina Residents Educational Lottery Scholarship – ELS was created by the 2005 General Assembly to provide financial assistance to North Carolina resident students attending eligible North Carolina colleges and universities who demonstrate exceptional financial need. UNC Need-Based Grant – Available for eligible students attending one of the 16 campuses of the University of North Carolina system. With some exceptions, students who are NC residents for tuition purposes qualify for state grants and scholarships. To establish and retain eligibility for North Carolina State grants, students must obtain and maintain North Carolina residency, as determined by the State of North Carolina.
