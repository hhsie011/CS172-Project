Everyone who has a Temple University OWLcard, has a Diamond Dollars account. Since you already need your official university ID, you can also enjoy the ease of making purchases at any one of our partner vendors. Looking to add money to someone's account? All you need to do is make a deposit. While this is very beneficial to our students, employees can benefit as well. Employees can deposit money through cash, check, credit card or payroll deduction form. How much money do you spend on campus each month? Donâ€™t pay with green, pay with OWL! Departmental Cards Temple University departments may also take advantage of the program by applying for a Department Diamond Dollars card. Cardholders (budget unit heads) must complete a Diamond Dollars Cardholder Agreement and follow all university policies pertaining to their use (see The Fine Print). Monthly statements must be reviewed by the cardholder and approved by a dean, director or budget unit head.
