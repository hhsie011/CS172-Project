We have anonymously reached out to students across campus to ask for a quick shout-out for their faculty who are doing this well. Visit our shout-out page and stay tuned to the TLPDC Facebook to read what they're saying. As we move back into more face-to-face instruction for classes being offered Fall 2021, we still want to be mindful of best practices regardless of modality. The Teaching, Learning, and Professional Development Center offered the following collection of resources for our teaching community amid the COVID-19 pandemic that is still useful for remote/online learning. We are grateful to a larger group of educational developers, faculty, and colleagues invested in students and in higher education who have shared resources from their disciplinary societies and institutions, and for the POD Network. As we've shifted from remote teaching to online teaching and changed our mindsets to focus less on emergency transitions and more on quality online course design principles such as accessibility and consistent interaction with students, we plan to leave these resources on the site given that they still represent many strong principles and strategies for faculty.
