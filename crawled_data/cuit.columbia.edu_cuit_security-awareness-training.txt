Email ‘phishing’ attacks, where a person is asked to take action or follow a link designed to extract sensitive information. Internet attacks that are used to harvest sensitive information about employees or customers through activities on search engines, social media sites, message boards or forums. Fraudulent web pages may be designed to gather sensitive information like log-in credentials and get you to complete them. Personal attacks, where social engineers conduct visits to buildings or offices using a fake identity to gather information, eavesdrop, access conference calls or log into an unsecured computer.
