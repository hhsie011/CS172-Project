Additional Tools There are many digital learning tools to consider using when planning your course. If you would like to share success stories or inquire about tools not on this list, please write to dld@brown.edu. Note that adding tools to our official Supported/Approved list can take a semester or two as we thoroughly examine FERPA compliance, privacy, security, support, terms of use, overlap with existing Brown tools, accessibility, and other factors.
