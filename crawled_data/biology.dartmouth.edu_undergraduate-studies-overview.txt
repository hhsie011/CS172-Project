Majors develop an in-depth understanding within an area of concentration, while non-majors explore research methods and approaches in the life sciences. Our faculty are committed to providing students with a broad exposure to biological processes and systems and a deep understanding of biology at environmental, organismal, cellular, and molecular levels. With their faculty advisors, students extract DNA from plant and animal cells, study genetics of diverse life forms and species, translate their findings to higher organisms, and potentially impact human diseases and find solutions to environmental problems. Our learning objectives for undergraduates Majors Acquire a foundation in biology in order to understand and evaluate a broad spectrum of biological information; for example, information presented in the media and relevant to public policy decisions. Develop an in-depth understanding within a biological area of concentration, designed in consultation with faculty to meet the student’s educational and career goals. Such depth will allow students to understand and critically evaluate current scientific literature in one or more areas of biology. Understand research methods and approaches currently used in the life sciences through coursework and through an independent research project under the supervision of a Dartmouth faculty member. Develop critical thinking and problem solving skills. Develop written and oral communication skills, allowing for accurate communication of biology information to scientists and non-scientists. Our learning objectives for undergraduates Minors Acquire a foundation in biology in order to understand and evaluate a broad spectrum of biological information; for example, information presented in the media and relevant to public policy decisions. Understand research methods and approaches currently used in the life sciences through coursework and by having the opportunity to perform an independent research project under the supervision of a Dartmouth faculty member. Develop critical thinking and problem solving skills. Develop written and oral communication skills, allowing for accurate communication of biology information to scientists and non-scientists. General Information This site provides information useful to current and prospective undergraduate students, including descriptions of our course majors and minors, and advising program; an overview of research opportunities in biology; and helpful links about careers in biology. To learn more about a particular topic, use the links listed in this section on Undergraduate Studies. If you have any questions not covered here or in the Organization-Regulations-Courses (ORC), please contact any member of the Undergraduate Committee. Undergraduate Committee members are Prof. Natasha Grotz and Prof. Thomas Jack. If you are a prospective student and would like to set up an appointment with a faculty member, please contact the department office by email. If you would like assistance with introductory or foundation courses in biology, the Teaching Science Fellows may be able to help.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Biological Sciences Undergraduate Overview Welcome Class of 2026 Welcome Back Classes of 2023, 2024, 2025 Major & Minor Course Schedules & Syllabi Current and Upcoming Bio 11 and Foundation Classes First Year Writing Seminars - Biology 7 Biology 11 Foundation Course Offerings Foundation Level Course Syllabi Intermediate Level Course Syllabi Advanced Level Course Syllabi Non-Major Course Syllabi Foreign Study Program Faculty Advisors Teaching Science Fellows Independent Study & the Honors Program Research Opportunities Dartmouth-sponsored Research Programs Funding and Finding an Advisor Transfer Credits Graduate Overview Ecology, Evolution, Environment & Society Molecular and Cellular Biology Research Overview Resources & Research Facilities Life Sciences Light Microscopy Facility Faculty Publications Neukom Postdoctoral Fellowship Foreign Study Program Seminars, News & Events News & Events Cramer Seminar Series Chris Reed Memorial Lecture Past Symposia and Conferences Travel People SEPA My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
