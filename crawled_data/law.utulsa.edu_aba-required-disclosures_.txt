Letters of recommendation must be submitted through LSAC. Submit a statement that explains a reason for the transfer request. Arrange for the dean of your current law school to send a letter of good standing to our admissions office. This letter should also include class rank. Arrange for your current law school to send an official transcript reflecting a full year of formal matriculation. If you have completed only one semester, a conditional decision will be made based upon hours completed. Acceptance will be contingent upon receipt of a transcript reflecting all matriculation including the second semester. A second letter of good standing will need to be sent when the final transcript is sent. Specific policies regarding transfer applications may be found in the College of Law’s Handbook TRANSFER OF CREDITS AND GRADES Admission with Advanced Standing The Admission and Financial Aid Committee, in its discretion, may admit a transfer student with advanced standing subject to the following: The dean of the law school from which the transfer is sought shall certify in writing the applicant’s good standing and the unconditional eligibility to re-enroll. The academic credit to be transferred shall have been earned in a law school that is approved or provisionally approved by the American Bar Association. The applicant shall meet all admission standards of the College and shall comply with the College’s procedures for admission. A transfer with advanced standing shall be denied if no transferable law school credits have been earned within a period of three years prior to the commencement of the semester or summer session for which admission is sought. Criteria For Transfer of Credit from Another Institution The University of Tulsa College of Law may accept credits from an ABA-accredited law school where appropriate as determined by the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs. No transfer credit will be accepted for any course where a student earned a grade of C- or lower, and no transfer credit will be accepted for any ungraded course (including courses graded on a pass/fail basis or satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis). The Associate Dean for Academic Affairs will determine the number of credits that will be accepted for transfer and the number of transfer hours to be credited toward the degree. The Associate Dean for Academic Affairs will determine whether the transfer credits courses satisfy specific graduation requirements and also determine the graduation requirements the student must still satisfy at The University of Tulsa. 800 S.
