Dennery, MD The Department of Pediatrics at The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University provides the most advanced pediatric medical care in an academic environment fostering investigation, advocacy and community engagement. Our faculty are experts at treating the most common to the most complex childhood diseases. As a Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Center, Hasbro Children’s Hospital, the main pediatric hospital for Brown, we are always ready for any emergency. Our hospital has the only pediatric emergency department in Southeastern New England, as well as the state’s only pediatric critical care team and ambulance that operates around the clock. Our faculty has unique expertise and research focus including participation in various registries in hemophilia, oncology, diabetes, AIDS and HIV, inflammatory bowel disease, treatment-resistant nephrotic syndrome and rheumatic diseases. We are also conducting studies on preventing obesity in children, investigating liver development and growth hormone regulation, better understanding child abuse prevention, evaluating premature lung and brain injury, triggers of premature birth, understanding cystic fibrosis and disorders of airway mucous clearance, among others. We are involved in the Center for International Health Research where we are focused on perinatal parasitic diseases such as malaria, as well as tuberculosis in adolescents. We have several large multicenter grants, funded by the National Institutes of Health, to study environmental impacts on child health outcomes (ISPCTN through ECHO, Office of the Director of NIH), and the role of adversity and social determinants on asthma severity (Asthma Care Implementation Program, NHLBI). We also participate in large networks to improve interdisciplinary training in developmental and behavioral pediatrics (LEND, HRSA), as well as provide support for clinical and translational researchers across the campus (Advance-CTR, NIGMS). We are committed to providing outstanding education to our students and trainees and have received numerous awards for this work.
