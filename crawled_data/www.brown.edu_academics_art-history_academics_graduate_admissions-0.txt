Prospective students interested in applying for graduate study in our department should apply through the Graduate School. For specific questions about our programs, please contact the Director of Graduate Studies, Sheila Bonde. Frequently Asked Questions Do I have to take the GREs? The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) general test is no longer required for entry into the PhD program. How can I check on my admission status? Applicants should expect to be notified by the Graduate School, within four to eight weeks of the application deadline for their programs (February or March for a January 1 deadline). While individual academic programs evaluate applicants for admission, offers of admission are only binding when made in writing by the Dean of the Graduate School. Admission may, in some cases, be deferred; aid offers cannot be deferred. For information on admissions, please email [email protected] Is the TOEFL exam required if my native language is not English? Yes. Brown University requires this exam. However, if you have a previous degree (BA or MA) from an institution where the primary language of instruction is English you do not have to take the TOEFL.
