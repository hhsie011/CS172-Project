The prevailing American view is that Chinese firms, rather than innovating, compete on the basis of mimicry, technology theft, and government subsidization. This paper, while not denying the evidence for technology duplication, illuminates three additional aspects of empirical reality: Chinese industrial innovation; multidirectional learning between Chinese and non-Chinese technology firms; and complementary, tiered development across Chinese and advanced industrial commercial innovators. The existence of these cross-border collaborative phenomena, while not invalidating the additional reality of inter-state commercial rivalry, suggests that such rivalry is neither structurally determined nor all pervasive. Extensive evidence of firm-level collaboration challenges the idea that climate remediation is necessarily impeded by a structurally-determined, geopolitically-driven “tragedy of the commons.” more Patrick Heller, advisor on the 2013-14 India Exclusion Report, discusses the recently released report April 29, 2015 According to Patrick Heller, professor of sociology and international affairs and an adviser on the recently released India Exclusion Report 2013-14, "This report is a path-breaking effort to provide reliable and systematic data and analysis on patterns of social exclusion in India. By exposing the ways in which policies across areas as diverse as education, health, employment and urban planning are failing to include the most marginalized and the most vulnerable, the report can serve as a vital resource for policy and opinion-makers alike." more Patricia Agupusi is co-author of "Homegrown Development in Africa: Reality or Illusion?"
