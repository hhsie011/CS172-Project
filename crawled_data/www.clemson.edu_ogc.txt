Intake Form Policy on Freedom of Information Act Requests The Office of General Counsel provides legal advice to the Board of Trustees, the president, the administration, faculty and staff on legal matters involving or affecting Clemson University. This office provides assistance to University vice presidents in the formulation of administrative policies, as well as legal advice to all deans, directors and department heads as needed. The office engages in risk and opportunity management and preventive counseling, including the identification of high risk activities and enterprises conducted by the University and the articulation of methodologies or strategies for coping with the risks. The office is responsible for selecting and supervising any outside counsel engaged by the institution. It is always helpful to mark communications to the OGC as "Attorney-Client Privileged/Confidential" as a reminder to anyone who might have access to such communications. Also, while Clemson strives to provide the best possible security for electronic messages to and from our office, the contents of e-mail should be considered as any other form of written communication and care should be exercised in deciding what to include and how it is phrased. PROCEDURE FOR NEW LEGAL MATTERS: In order to track and efficiently handle your matter, the Office of General Counsel requests that new projects or contracts requiring attorney review or assistance be submitted by completing the Intake Form (opens with Firefox browser, Clemson ID required). If you have a question about this form or if this is urgent, please call 864-656-3414.
