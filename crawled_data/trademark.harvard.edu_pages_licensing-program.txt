Because Harvard takes a traditional approach concerning the types of products it will license and how the marks may be used on them, both licensing programs utilize a rigorous set of standards when evaluating companies requesting licenses. This is done by assessing the following: the appropriateness and quality of the proposed licensed products; how the Harvard trademarks will be used; the marketability of the products; and a potential licensee's history of compliance with business and licensing standards. Typically, the University licenses select goods such as apparel, novelty items, and stationery products and other “traditional” licensed items. In addition, licensees must be members in good standing with the Fair Labor Association, must carry commercial general liability insurance, and must pay royalties on the licensed products that are sold. After covering the Trademark Program’s operational costs, all royalty revenue generated by the licensing programs is used to support student financial aid initiatives at Harvard.
