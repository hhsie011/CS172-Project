Photos (top: Olivier Metzger | bottom: Arnaud Delrue About the festival KEMBARA: Adventures in the Artistic Landscape of South East Asia [Kembara – Malay; noun: An adventure; a voyage out of curiosity or restlessness, often with no fixed destination other than to explore the world] A series of events that showcases the dynamism of contemporary South East Asian art and culture, and the way it reflects rapid political and social changes in the region, as well as the way those changes are felt internationally. Kembara: Adventures in the Artistic Landscape of South East Asia takes as its starting point film screenings, theatrical productions, and works of visual art, and uses these to expand into cross-genre conversations between film-makers and novelists, scholars and painters.
