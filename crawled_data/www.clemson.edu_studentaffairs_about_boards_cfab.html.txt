Student Affairs About Advisory Boards Current: Clemson Family Advisory Board Membership, Initiatives and Expectations CFAB Expectations The Clemson Family Advisory Board (CFAB) is a group of dedicated parents who significantly assist the University as it strives to meet the educational and developmental needs of our students while also addressing parents' needs for involvement, information and support. CFAB makes every effort to be a well-informed resource, assist in academic recruiting and offer the parents' perspective to the University. Board membership applications are submitted each November, after parents of graduating students have rotated off. If you have questions about CFAB or the application process, please contact the Center for Student Leadership and Engagement at 864-656-0515 or by emailing cufamilies@clemson.edu. CFAB Initiatives Family Weekends — CFAB works with the Center for Student Leadership and Engagement in the planning and implementation of this annual family event occurring in both Fall and Spring on campus. The committee also coordinates all volunteers needed for the weekend. New Student Orientation — The Orientation chair works with the Center for Student Leadership and Engagement to train, coordinate and solicit volunteers. These individuals distribute CFAB literature to parents, answer questions and welcome families to Clemson. All committee members are requested to volunteer in some capacity. Move-In — CFAB works with the Center for Student Leadership and Engagement to train, coordinate and solicit volunteers who welcome students and their families to campus each August. Student Outreach — CFAB works with the Center for Student Leadership and Engagement and Undergraduate Admissions to solicit volunteers to engage accepted students.
