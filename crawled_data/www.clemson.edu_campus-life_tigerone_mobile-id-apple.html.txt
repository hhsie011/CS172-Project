After adding your TigerOne Mobile ID to your Wallet, simply tap your TigerOne Mobile ID at readers on and off campus for access to residence halls, dining locations, Campus Rec, libraries, retail locations and more! How do I get the TigerOne Mobile ID? Ensure that you have an approved photo on file. Visit the TigerOne Online Credential Selection module to select your mobile device type. On your supported device, download the my.Clemson app from the App Store. Open my.clemson from your iPhone and select the ID icon at the top right. Log in using your Clemson credentials, and then complete the DUO authentication. Select the “Add to Apple Wallet” button. Then select whether you would like to add the TigerOne Mobile ID to your iPhone or Apple Watch. You may add the ID to both device types. Agree to the Terms and Conditions. The ID will now be available in your Wallet. You do not need to keep the my.Clemson app for functionality of the TigerOne Mobile ID. Where can I use the TigerOne Mobile ID? You can use your TigerOne Mobile ID anywhere that the TigerOne ID is accepted, including the following locations: Meal plan usage at on-campus dining locations.

How do I use the TigerOne Mobile ID? Express Mode The TigerOne Mobile ID features the “Express Mode” transaction experience. For TigerOne ID readers, a user is able to approach the reader with a dark screen on their iPhone or Apple Watch without needing to authenticate via Face ID or Touch ID. Express Mode enables an extremely fast, frictionless experience designed for campus use. When Express Mode is enabled, users will not be able to view their TigerOne card in Apple Wallet by double tapping the side button or home button. When you add your TigerOne Mobile ID to Apple Wallet, Express Mode is turned on by default. If you don’t want to use Express Mode, you can turn it off. Open Wallet, tap your TigerOne Mobile ID, tap the ellipses in the top right and tap the Express Mode on/off button. TigerOne Mobile ID for iPhone Tap the phone's top to the reader. The top of the iPhone is where the NFC antennae is located. You do not need to wake up the phone as long as express mode is activated. Some phone cases can block the use of NFC. If your Mobile ID is not reacting, try removing the case to ensure this is not the cause of the issue. TigerOne Mobile ID for Apple Watch Tap the face of the watch to the reader. You do not need to wake up the watch as long as express mode is activated. Frequently Asked Questions How can I view my CUID number from the TigerOne Mobile ID?
