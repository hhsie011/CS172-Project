Resources Prospective Students Research Courses People Events Centers Diversity & Inclusion Room Reservations Resources During COVID Interdepartmental There are several degree programs offered in conjunction with other departments or administered by other departments: Physics & Engineering (administered jointly with the School of Engineering), Sc.B. only This concentration provides students with an in-depth understanding of the fundamental principles underlying modern technology. Specifically, it gives those who are interested in applied technical problems a strong background in physics and mathematics beyond that given in the standard engineering program. Students take a significant part of the usual engineering and physics programs, obtain substantial laboratory experience, and take several upper-level courses focusing on applied physics. The program allows students to take either the standard physics or engineering programs during their freshman and sophomore years and then switch to this combined program. The courses are as follows: PHYS 50, 60; or PHYS 70,160; or ENGN 30, 40 MATH 170, 180 (or equivalently, MATH 190, 200) and three additional math or applied math courses (two of which are usually APMA 330,340 or APMA 350, 360) CSCI 40 or higher-level programming course such as CSCI 150 or 170 PHYS 470, 1510 or ENGN 510, 1560 PHYS 500 or ENGN 1370 PHYS 1410-1420 PHYS 1530 or ENGN 720 ENGN 1620 One course from: ENGN 1310, ENGN 810, CHEM 330, or a physics course on continuum mechanics One course from: ENGN 1690, ENGN 410, PHYS 560 One course from: PHYS 1560, ENGN 1590, ENGN 2920 A thesis under the supervision of a physics faculty member (PHYS 1980) or engineering faculty member (ENGN 1970 or ENGN 1971) will also be required. In addition, students must take four courses in the humanities and social sciences. They are encouraged to consider taking courses dealing with the philosophical, ethical, or political aspects of science and technology. Physics & Philosophy (administered jointly with the Department of Philosophy), A.B. only The Physics and Philosophy A.B. Concentration is for undergraduates who have a deep interest in understanding physics but do not need to acquire the laboratory and computational skills of a professional physicist. It acquaints students with the most philosophically interesting physics and balances the student's need to grapple with some computational problems with their need to deepen their investigation of conceptual and epistemological issues. This concentration should prepare a student either for graduate study, especially in a history and philosophy of science (HPS) program, or for employment in science education or journalism. Other professions such as law and medicine will look favorably on such concentrators for having versatile interests and being able to master difficult material. The concentration may serve as an excellent preparation for a law school since physics and philosophy both exercise a rigorous approach to problems of immediate relevance to life but at the same time assume two complimentary and sometimes competing viewpoints.
