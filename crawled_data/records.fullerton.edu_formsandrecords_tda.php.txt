In 1997, the Office of Admissions and Records (now being maintained by the office of Records and Registration) began setting up the requirements of the undergraduate degree programs, including major, minor and general education in the TITAN Degree Audit program. This program produces reports that inform CSUF students and advisers of the completion status of degree requirements. The TDA is the official grad check document. TDA TUTORIAL <p>Your browser does not support frames.</p> NEWLY ADMITTED FIRST TIME FRESHMEN Your TDA will not contain any transfer courses, unless you transfer college-level test credits (i.e. Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate) and/or courses. It is advisable to check the accuracy of your TDA regularly to ensure that any issues will be addressed in a timely manner. NEWLY ADMITTED TRANSFER STUDENTS (FALL 2008 AND AFTER) If you are a newly admitted transfer student, your Titan Degree Audit (TDA) will be a preliminary evaluation of your transfer coursework. Your TDA will remain preliminary until you receive notification from the Office of Records and Registration that final evaluation of your records has been completed. CONTINUING STUDENTS It is advisable to check the accuracy of your TDA regularly to ensure that any issues will be addressed in a timely manner. CANDIDATES FOR GRADUATION Please check the Graduation Process in on our Graduation page . TITAN DEGREE AUDIT REQUEST Titan Degree Audit (TDA) is accessible via the Student Portal . For more information on accessing and using the TDA please view the Titan Degree Audit Tutorial. TDA EXCEPTION FORM The TDA Exception Form handles any modifications made on the major requirements. An exception is only submitted by an approved major department advisor internally to TDA services. Students should visit your department/faculty advisors to discuss any modifications to your TDA. RECENT GRADUATES Once your degree is conferred, your TDA will no longer be active. You may run a "what-if" TDA instead. If you still have access to your Student Portal, you may view your unofficial transcript in your Student Center accessible from the "Titan Online" tab. The Alumni Portal does not provide access to unofficial transcript at this time. Alumni and former students who have not taken a class since 2007 must order official transcripts through the Request for Transcripts form. This site is maintained by CSUF Registration and Records.
