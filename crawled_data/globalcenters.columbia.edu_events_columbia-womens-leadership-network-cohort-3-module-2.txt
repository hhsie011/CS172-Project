Module #2 Events Past Event Columbia Women's Leadership Network Cohort 3 - Module #2 Share Add to Calendar: Google Yahoo May 7, 2021 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM Online Event Module #2 Strengths Assessment and workshop May 07 (Friday) 09:00 AM- 5:00 PM Rio de Janeiro Instructor: Dr Brian Perkins (Senior Lecturer – Teachers College, Director of the Urban Education Leaders Program at Teachers College, Columbia University in the Department of Organization and Leadership) The participants will take an online survey that uncovers the strengths of your team of leaders along 34 empirically-validated themes. It enables your leaders to discover their top five Strengths Insights and build their daily activities and long-term strategies around them. Along with the Strengths Discovery report, your leaders receive an Action-Planning Guide which helps in releasing the power within and transforming your educational organization along the way. During the workshop, the instructor will convene the group by administering the different instruments, analyzing the resultant reports, tracking the organization’s progress, building an improvement plan customizable to the organization’s needs and aspirations, and transforming the plan into actions and strategies. Our goal is to work with the participants to unlock the full potential of our leaders and nurture the organization’s growth in a measurable and sustainable manner.
