The fellowship combines a diverse and active operative and clinical schedule with the opportunity for clinical research. With a reasonable call schedule and an active operating room experience, the Fellow(s) will be expected to participate in resident education, didactic conferences and research. Our interest is in training surgeons who will undertake a career in either academics or private practice. The goal of this Fellowship is to produce well-rounded and competent spinal surgeons with a broad knowledge of patient evaluation, clinical decision making, pre-operative planning, operative technique and post-operative care. The Fellow is also expected to become adept at analysis of the literature and will have the ability to contribute to orthopaedic research.
