Whether they get into the seminar they elected/requested is determined during the registration processing period. Students who did not get into their first choice during initial course election choose another First-year Seminar from among those with space available during the course changes period prior to the start of classes. Students enrolled in a First-year Seminar may use the online registration system to switch into a different seminar, as long as there is space available, during the course changes period or during the add-drop period in the first week of classes. The details on the schedule for course election, course changes period, and add-drop period for a given term can be found on the Registrar's website. Advice on switching among First-year Seminars during the course changes and add-drop periods can be found on our switch page. Enrollment in a First-year Seminar is limited to 16 students. Enrollment above the limit is never allowed in a First-year Seminar course. Open slots are first-come, first-served. No waiting lists are maintained. Effective in Fall 2021, First-year Seminars do not serve in partial satisfaction of the General Education requirements such as distributive requirements or the world culture requirement. Important Scheduling Guidelines Regarding First-year Seminars: Successful completion of Writing 5 (or its approved equivalents) is a prerequisite for enrollment in a First-year Seminar (or Humanities 2). The First-year Seminar (or Humanities 2) must be taken during the first year, in the term immediately following completion of Writing 5 (or its approved equivalents). A student is not eligible to take part in an off-campus program until the First-year Seminar (or Humanities 2) is completed. First-year Seminar Descriptions: See First-year Seminar Course Descriptions Page for more information on the topics offered in the current or upcoming term. The descriptions page will display the descriptions for the upcoming term shortly before registration opens to first-year students for that term. Archived examples of course descriptions from past terms can be found here.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Institute for Writing and Rhetoric Philosophy & Aims About Writing at Dartmouth Speech at Dartmouth Our Stories The Story of Writing Instruction at Dartmouth The Story of Speech at Dartmouth The Story of Writing Support at Dartmouth Curriculum Overview Writing Courses Writing 2-3 WRIT 5 First-Year Seminars Humanities 1-2 Speech Courses Speech 20 Speech 25 Speech 26 Speech 27 Speech 30 Speech 31 Speech 33 Speech 34 Speech 36 Speech 37 Speech 40 Placement and Enrollment Policies First-Year Writing & First-Year Seminar Requirements Differences Among First-Year Writing Courses FAQ Directed Self-Placement Process for Writing Registration for Writing 5 or Writing 2-3 Registration for First Year Seminars FAQ First-year Writing Registration First-year Writing Choices Prizes Writing Prize Winners Speech Contest Winners Speech Contest Call for Entries Learning Overview Writing Center Make an Appointment Materials Sources and Citations at Dartmouth Teaching Overview Guidelines Teaching Writing in the First Year Expectations for Writing 2-3 Expectations for Writing 5 Teaching the First-Year Seminar First-Year Writing: Pedagogies, Methods, & Design Active Learning in the First-Year Writing Classroom Syllabus and Assignment Design Teaching Writing as Process Integrating Reading and Writing Diagnosing and Responding to Student Writing Conducting Writing Workshops Collaborative Learning/Learning with Peers Teaching Argument Teaching Research Addressing Grammar Useful links Support The Writing Assistant Program Research Past Research Activities Research Overview Multilingual Overview Support for Undergraduate Students Support for Graduate Students Faculty Support News & People People News Employment Upcoming Events Past Events My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
