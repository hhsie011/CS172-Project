In 2015, Dean el-Khoury initiated U-Serve, a day of service, dedicated to the community. In its first year, 200+ participated in a Little Havana project, enabling the City of Miami to establish a comprehensive inventory of the their building stock. In year two, U-Serve partnered with the Friends of the Underline to "green" 10 miles of space under the Metrorail. In April 2015, the school received a substantial grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation to help bring “third places” to Miami neighborhoods.
