The program equips students with the theoretical and methodological expertise to address important contemporary issues, such as climate change and adaptation, built environment transformation, immigration and migration, housing and community development, and poverty and inequality. It is a highly competitive doctoral program, accepting only three candidates each year. We welcome prospective students from a wide range of backgrounds, and value strong abilities for critical thinking and independent research. In reviewing applications, the Ph.D. faculty make decisions collectively, based on students’ academic preparation, topical areas of interest, and experience with analytical. We encourage students to explore various directions of intellectual growth after enrollment. The Ph.D. in Urban Planning is a program within the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation (GSAPP) while the actual degree is granted by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS). A Ph.D. in Urban Planning Information Session was held on October 1, please scroll down to view the full recording. The application deadline for Ph.D. in Urban Planning is December 16, 2021. For additional information and online application please visit the GSAS website. Core Urban Planning Doctoral Faculty Hiba Bou Akar Hugo Sarmiento Weiping Wu, Director Organization of the Program In consultation with faculty, students develop individual study programs anchored in advanced knowledge concerning the socioeconomic, political, and environmental processes that shape cities and regions, and the quality of life within them. Underlying these inquiries are questions related to the effectiveness of urban processes, and their justice, democracy, and ethics. Students are required to spend four semesters in residence during which time they are expected to take 48 credit points. In addition to the seven required doctoral seminars and colloquia, students can take courses across Columbia. It is assumed that the coursework will be spread out evenly over the first four semesters of study. Advising Upon entering the program, each student consults with the program director for the duration of their coursework. The program director’s role is to provide independent guidance and mentorship on all aspects of student life. Students meet at least once each semester with the program director to discuss their academic progress and future plans. By the date of the comprehensive examination and prior to submitting their dissertation prospectus, each student selects a dissertation advisor (also known as sponsor), to act as a guide during the course of dissertation research and for the dissertation defense. During this or any other time, students are still able to draw on the mentorship of other Ph.D. faculty.
