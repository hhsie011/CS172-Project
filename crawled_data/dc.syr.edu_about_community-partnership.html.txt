The Baltimore-Washington, DC-based nonprofit strengthens communities and inspires young people to achieve their potential through hands-on education and job training, using urban, natural, and maritime resources as “living classrooms.” The UA House at Fayette operated by Living Classrooms—made possible in part by support from former Syracuse University basketball star and native Baltimorean Carmelo Anthony—responds to the community’s need for intervention that supports the academic and social development of disadvantaged youth. The UA House at Fayette serves over one hundred students daily with academic enrichment, health, sports and physical fitness education, and career development. It also serves adults with workforce development, career services, entrepreneurial development, and GED and ESL support. Those served reside primarily in low-income neighborhoods and their communities lack many of the services found in more affluent communities. The center provides services in five key areas—education and career development, character and development, health and life skills, the arts and cultural enrichment, and sports and recreation.
