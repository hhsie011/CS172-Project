Magazine Outreach Ways to Give Clemson Home College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences Research Current: Grant Management Grant Management Post Awards The College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences Grants and Contracts Administration Office (Post-Awards) serves 3 primary roles for the college. The first is as a liaison between the college Principal Investigators (PIs) and the University Grants & Contracts Administration office. The second is as a project manager for FUND 20 projects. The third is as an auditor, serving as the point of contact for compliance issues at all levels. Faculty Business Information Systems (FBIS) is a tool that lists all of a user’s Fund 20 projects upon login, projects’ direct budget balances, and payroll and journal entry drill-down capabilities. Additional features include the ability to manually add projects that users are a CO-PI on, see multiple views of budgets with visual cues for planning and burn rate purposes, and view direct expenditures for user’s Funds 10-19 projects. Important Information Fiscal Year End 6/30 – All expenditures incurred before 6/30 should be charged to the fiscal year that is closing. Your College contact person will coordinate with CU GCA. If a no-cost extension is needed, the request should be sent to GCA at least 30 days before the end date. Confirmation of direct costs within 30 days after the end date if the project is closing. GCA’s time frame is dependent on the type of sponsor. Final invoices and final financial reports must be submitted within the required time frame. Revised Federal OMB Uniform Guidance – effective 12/26/14. Facilities and Administrative Cost Allocations Facilities and Administration Rates Applicable Category Rate % (FY16) Rate % (FY17) Rate % (FY18) Rate % (FY19) Research On-Campus 50.0% 52.0% 52.0% 52.5% Facilities and administrative (F&A) costs are defined as those costs that are incurred for common or joint objectives of the University, and therefore, cannot be identified readily and specifically with a particular sponsored project, an instructional activity, or any other institutional activity. These costs are comprised of a number of components. Facilities include depreciation and use allowances, interest on debt associated with certain buildings, equipment and capital improvements, operation and maintenance expenses, and library expenses. Administration includes general administration and general expenses, departmental administration, and sponsored projects administration. New F&A Rates Effective July 1, 2016. More information at Research FAQs. Residual Balances in Fixed Price Contracts Policy Effective 2/24/2014, the procedure for transferring remaining project balances in fixed-price contracts was incorporated into the policy on "Residual Balances in Fixed Price Contracts". Remaining balances greater than 10% of the total original award require VPR approval prior to transfer. Full policy information can be found on the OSP website or Residual Balances PDF. Export Controls and Foreign Travel Clemson policy states that travel "outside the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Canada or Puerto Rico meets the definition of foreign travel and requires approval prior to departure." U.S. Export Control regulations do apply to Canada; therefore, employees who travel to Canada must complete a foreign travel request form so the Export Control office can approve. However, when submitting payment for Canada trips, out-of-state rates and account codes apply. Foreign Travel Authorization/Request Form Attach backup documentation to this form that shows your purpose for the trip (email, website, etc.). Give adequate time for approval prior to the trip. Departmental personnel should attach the APPROVED FT form to appropriate expenditure documentation (VISA charge, travel voucher, etc). Current routing/approval chain: PI -> Department Head -> CECAS Dean’s Office -> CECAS Post Awards -> CECAS Dean’s Office -> CU Grants & Contracts Admin(GCA) -> Export Control -> CU GCA -> CECAS Dean’s Office -> Department/PI Foreign National Payments Payments made to a foreign national (non-resident alien) for activities occurring within the U.S. may be taxable under the IRS Revenue Code. Policy and Procedure regarding these activities are located in the Finance Division Business Manual. Questions regarding policy or payment procedures should be directed to Pablo Unda, International Employment Manager, 864-656-5591. Participant Support (PARTSP) Paid from vouchers/NOT payroll Account codes: 7550 Part Supp Incentive Cards 7551 Part Supp-Reimbursable Exp 7552 Part Supp-NonReimb-eg Stipends 7553 Part Supp-NonReimb-Foreign Nat Remaining Budget Balances at Project End Be wary of processing corrections after the project end date. This could give the appearance of "zeroing out" remaining budget balances. If corrections after the project end date are necessary, be sure to provide an adequate explanation. CECAS Post Awards office intends to notify the principal investigator 3 months prior to the end date.
