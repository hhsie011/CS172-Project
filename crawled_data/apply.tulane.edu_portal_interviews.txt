They are optional, and while the interviewer's evaluation will be considered by the admission committee, it will not be a deciding factor in the admission decision. Tulane will offer interviews beginning in late summer. We also encourage you to join us for virtual events, tours, and other programming. Students cannot request interviews with their counselor specifically; each student will be matched at random with Tulane Admission staff. In order to provide all interested students equitable access, you may only sign up for one interview. If you have already interviewed virtually and schedule an in-person interview, your appointment will be cancelled. Students should register for an interview as early as possible; fewer interviews will be available in the fall. Admission representatives may be able to conduct a limited number of in-person interviews during 2022. If you are interested in interviewing but do not see in-person interviews in your area, we highly recommend you sign up for a virtual interview rather than wait for interviews to be available in your area. Virtual and in-person interviews carry the same weight in the admission process. Students who do not show up for their interview will not be allowed to interview again. Please email interviews@tulane.edu if you have any questions. If you need to reschedule a virtual interview, please email us at least 48 hours before your interview is scheduled to take place. In-person interviews cannot be rescheduled. Virtual Interviews Virtual interview slots are added at the end of each month, so please check back if all slots are booked. Legend: Available Filled Unavailable In-Person Interviews In-person interview slots are not available on campus and are added as travel planning permits. Please check back throughout the summer to see if new interviews become available.
