Torres Vice Chancellor Research and Economic Development April 20, 2022 Dear Campus Community, In consultation with the Public Health Committee and in alignment with other current COVID-19 policies at the UCR, county, state and national levels, researchers no longer need to consult the risk matrix for human subjects research or complete Work Site Specific Plans. All researchers should plan to return to the normal protocols of securing IRB approval and complying with all UCR campus policies, including those outlined at https://campusreturn.ucr.edu/. They are responsible to communicate campus and statewide policies appropriately to research participants, and thus should be aware of the current (and evolving) guidance around face coverings provided by the CDPH. We will continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic evolution and modify our health guidelines as needed. Thank you for your ongoing work.
