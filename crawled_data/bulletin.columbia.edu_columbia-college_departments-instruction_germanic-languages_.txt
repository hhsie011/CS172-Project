Many of the faculty specialize in the study of German literature and culture from 1700 to the present. German majors acquire proficiency in examining literary, philosophical, and historical texts in the original, as well as critical understanding of modern German culture and society. Particular attention is given to German-speaking traditions within larger European and global contexts. Courses taught in translation build on Columbia’s Core Curriculum, thereby allowing students to enroll in upper-level seminars before completing the language requirement. All classes are taught as part of a living culture. Students have ample opportunities to study abroad, to work with visiting scholars, and to take part in the cultural programs at Deutsches Haus. In addition, the department encourages internships with German firms, museums, and government offices. This hands-on experience immerses students in both language and culture, preparing them for graduate study and professional careers. Upon graduation, German majors compete successfully for Fulbright or DAAD scholarships for research in Germany or Austria beyond the B.A. degree. Our graduating seniors are highly qualified to pursue graduate studies in the humanities and social sciences, as well as professional careers. Former majors and concentrators have gone on to careers in teaching, law, journalism, banking and consulting, international affairs, and communications. German literature and culture courses are taught as seminars integrating philosophical and social questions. Topics include romanticism, revolution, and national identity; German intellectual history; minority literatures; Weimar cinema; German-Jewish culture and modernity; the Holocaust and memory; and the history and culture of Berlin. Classes are small, with enrollment ranging from 5 to 15 students. The department regularly offers courses in German literature and culture in English for students who do not study the German language. The department also participates in Columbia’s excellent program in comparative literature and society. Advanced Placement The department grants 3 credits for a score of 5 on the AP German Language exam, which satisfies the foreign language requirement. Credit is awarded upon successful completion of a 3000-level (or higher) course with a grade of B or higher. This course must be for at least 3 points of credit and be taught in German. Courses taught in English may not be used for language AP credit. The department grants 0 credits for a score of 4 on the AP German Language exam, but the foreign language requirement is satisfied. The Yiddish Studies Program The Yiddish Studies Progam at Columbia University, the global leader in Yiddish scholarship and teaching, focuses on the experiences and cultural efflorescence of Ashkenazic Jewry over a thousand years and five continents. It is a perfect exemplar of Columbia’s interests in global and transnational study, weaving together language, literature, and culture in a way that echoes the best of Columbia’s justly famed humanities programs. The program in Yiddish studies offers both the undergraduate Major and Concentration, in addition to graduate studies leading to the Ph.D. In both the undergraduate and graduate program, emphasis is placed not merely on acquiring linguistic proficiency and textual study, but also viewing Yiddish literature in a larger cultural and interdisciplinary context. The graduate program, the only degree-granting Yiddish Studies Program in the United States, is considered one of the world’s most important, with its graduates holding many of the major university positions in the field. Students of Yiddish have ample opportunities to enhance their studies through a number of fellowships. The Naomi Fellowship, a fully-subsidized Yiddish Study Abroad program allows students to explore Yiddish culture and history in Israel and Poland. The Irene Kronhill Pletka YIVO Fellowship enables students to expand on their archival research skills in New York. Upon graduation, our majors compete successfully for Fulbright and other prestigious scholarships, and are highly qualified to pursue careers in humanities, social sciences, as well as artistic and professional careers. Students work with faculty in Germanic languages, Jewish studies, history, and Slavic studies to broaden their understanding of the literature, language, and culture of Eastern European Jewry. The Yiddish Studies Program is also closely affiliated with the Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies, which offers diverse programming and other fellowship opportunities. Classes are small, and instruction is individualized and carefully directed to ensure that students gain both a thorough general grounding and are able to pursue their own particular interests in a wide-spanning field. The program also offers classes taught in translation for students who do not study Yiddish. The Yiddish programming, such as lectures, monthly conversation hours, Meet a Yiddish Celebrity series, as well as the activities of the Yiddish Club of Columbia’s Barnard/Hillel allows students to explore Yiddish culture outside the classroom. The German Language Placement Exam The German Language Placement exam is offered periodically to those students who already speak the language, in order to determine to determine their proficiency level (A, B or C). For more information, and for the latest exam dates, please click here. The German Language Program First- and second-year German language courses emphasize spoken and written communication, and provide a basic introduction to German culture. Goals include mastery of the structure of the language and enough cultural understanding to interact comfortably with native speakers. After successfully completing the elementary German sequence, GERM UN1101 ELEMENTARY GERMAN I-GERM UN1102 ELEMENTARY GERMAN II, students are able to provide information about themselves, their interests, and daily activities. They can participate in simple conversations, read edited texts, and understand the main ideas of authentic texts. By the end of GERM UN1102 ELEMENTARY GERMAN II, students are able to write descriptions, comparisons, and creative stories, and to discuss general information about the German-speaking countries. The intermediate German sequence, GERM UN2101 INTERMEDIATE GERMAN I-GERM UN2102 INTERMEDIATE GERMAN II, increases the emphasis on reading and written communication skills, expands grammatical mastery, and focuses on German culture and literary texts. Students read short stories, a German drama, and increasingly complex texts. Regular exposure to video, recordings, the World Wide Web, and art exhibits heightens the cultural dimensions of the third and fourth semesters. Students create portfolios comprised of written and spoken work. Upon completion of the second-year sequence, students are prepared to enter advanced courses in German language, culture, and literature at Columbia and/or at the Berlin Consortium for German Studies in Berlin. Advanced-level courses focus on more sophisticated use of the language structure and composition (GERM UN3001 ADVANCED GERMAN I-GERM UN3002 Advanced German II: Vienna ); on specific cultural areas; and on literary, historical, and philosophical areas in literature-oriented courses (GERM UN3333 Introduction To German Literature [In German]). In Fulfillment of the Language Requirement in German Students beginning the study of German at Columbia must take four terms of the following two-year sequence: Course List Code Title Points GERM UN1101 ELEMENTARY GERMAN I GERM UN1102 ELEMENTARY GERMAN II GERM UN2101 INTERMEDIATE GERMAN I GERM UN2102 INTERMEDIATE GERMAN II Entering students are placed, or exempted, on the basis of their College Board Achievement or Advanced Placement scores, or their scores on the placement test administered by the departmental language director. Students who need to take GERM UN1101 ELEMENTARY GERMAN I-GERM UN1102 ELEMENTARY GERMAN II may take GERM UN1125 Accelerated Elementary German I & II as preparation for GERM UN2101 INTERMEDIATE GERMAN I. University Study in Berlin The Berlin Consortium for German Studies provides students with a study abroad program, administered by Columbia, which includes students from the other consortium member schools (Princeton, Yale, University of Pennsylvania, Johns Hopkins, and the University of Chicago). Under the guidance of a senior faculty member, the program offers a home stay with a German family, intensive language instruction, and study in regular German university courses at the Freie Universität Berlin. For additional information on the Berlin Consortium, see the Study Abroad—Sponsored Programs section in this Bulletin, visit the Center for Undergraduate Global Engagement, or consult the program's office in 606 Kent Hall; 212-854-2559; berlin@columbia.edu. Deutsches Haus Deutsches Haus, 420 West 116th Street, provides a center for German cultural activities on the Columbia campus. It sponsors lectures, film series, and informal gatherings that enrich the academic programs of the department. Frequent events throughout the fall and spring terms offer students opportunities to practice their language skills. Grading Courses in which a grade of D has been received do not count toward the major or concentration requirements. Departmental Honors Normally no more than 10% of graduating majors receive departmental honors in a given academic year. For the requirements for departmental honors, see the director of undergraduate studies. Professors Mark Anderson (on leave, Fall 2022) Stefan Andriopoulos (on leave, AY2022-2023 Claudia Breger (Chair) Jeremy Dauber (on leave, AY2022-2023) Andreas Huyssen (emeritus) Harro Müller (emeritus) Dorothea von Mücke (on leave, Spring 2023) Annie Pfeifer Oliver Simons Senior Lecturers Wijnie de Groot (Dutch) Jutta Schmiers-Heller (German) Lecturers Agnieszka Legutko (Yiddish) Simona Vaidean (German) Major in German Literature and Cultural History The goal of the major is to provide students with reasonable proficiency in reading a variety of literary, philosophical, and historical texts in the original and, through this training, to facilitate a critical understanding of modern German-speaking cultures and societies. Students should plan their program of study with the director of undergraduate studies as early as possible. Competence in a second foreign language is strongly recommended, especially for those students planning to attend graduate school. The major in German literature and cultural history requires a minimum of 30 points, distributed as follows: Course List Code Title Points GERM UN3001 ADVANCED GERMAN I (can be waived and replaced by another 3000 level class upon consultation with the DUS) or GERM UN3002 Advanced German II: Vienna GERM UN3333 Introduction To German Literature [In German] Select two of the following survey courses in German literature and culture (at least one of these must focus on pre–20th-century cultural history): GERM UN3442 Literature in the 18th and 19th Centuries GERM UN3443 Romanticism, Revolution, Realism [In German] GERM UN3444 SURVEY OF GERMAN LIT:20C (GER) GERM UN3445 German Literature After 1945 [In German] One course in German intellectual history GERM UN3991 SENIOR SEMINAR The remaining courses to be chosen from the 3000- or 4000-level offerings in German and Comparative Literature–German in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Senior Thesis A senior thesis is not required for the major. Students interested in a senior thesis or research project may do so through independent study with a faculty member over one or two semesters. Major in Yiddish Studies The program is designed as a combination of language and content courses. First- and second-year Yiddish language courses emphasize spoken and written communication, and provide a basic introduction to Eastern European Jewish culture. Goals include mastery of the structure of the language and enough cultural understanding to interact comfortably with native speakers. After second-year Yiddish language courses are completed, students should feel sufficiently comfortable to begin to work with Yiddish literature in the original. Upper-level undergraduate/graduate courses are designed to accommodate students with a range of Yiddish language experience, and intensive language summer study abroad, such as the Naomi Prawer Kadar International Yiddish Summer Program (the Yiddish Studies program at Columbia offers the fully-subsidized Naomi Fellowship for students of Yiddish), or other academic summer programs, is also encouraged for improvement in language acquisition and comprehension. The goal is to provide students with reasonable proficiency in reading a variety of literary, philosophical, and historical texts in the original and, through this training, to provide them with a critical understanding of Yiddish-speaking culture and society. The second pillar of the Yiddish program is an intimate exposure to the literature and culture of the Yiddish-speaking Jewry. That exposure is achieved through several courses in Yiddish literature, which, although they may cover a variety of subjects or proceed from a number of methodological and disciplinary orientations, share a rigorous commitment to analyzing and experiencing that literature within an overarching historical and cultural framework. These courses in Yiddish literature, culture and Jewish history will provide students with a solid interdisciplinary foundation in Yiddish studies. Inevitably and necessary, these courses, whether taught in Yiddish, English, or in a combination of the Yiddish text and English language instruction – cover the sweep of Yiddish literary history from the early modern period to today. Students should plan their program of study with the director of undergraduate studies as early as possible. There is a prerequisite of two years of Yiddish, or equivalent to be demonstrated through testing. The Major in Yiddish Studies requires a minimum of 30 points, distributed as follows: Two courses of advanced language study (6 points); YIDD UN3101, YIDD UN3102 Three courses in Yiddish literature (9 points); e.g. YIDD UN3500, YIDD GU4420 At least one course related to a senior thesis (3 points); Four related courses, at least one of which is in medieval or modern Jewish history (12 points); e.g. HIST UN4604, YIDD GU4113. A senior thesis is required for the Major in Yiddish Studies. Students interested in a senior thesis or research project may do so through independent study with a faculty member over one or two semesters. Students must conduct original research, some of which must take place in the Yiddish language, and are required to submit a culminating paper, of no less that 35 pages. Elective courses: Elective courses can be taken at Columbia as well as at affiliated institutions such as the Jewish Theological Seminary, Barnard College, New York University, etc. Columbia’s arrangements with the joint degree appointing program at JTS, i.e. JTS and GS Joint program with List College, offers students exposure to a wide variety of courses on Yiddish and Yiddish-related topics taught by experts in the field of Yiddish and comparative Jewish literature such as Profs. David Roskies and Barbara Mann. Thanks to the consortial arrangements with other universities in the New York area (Barnard, NYU, Yale, Penn, etc.) students both in Columbia College and General Studies, can take courses at these institutions for degree credit, which allows for student exposure to experts in twentieth-century Soviet Yiddish literature, Yiddish women’s writing, Yiddish literature in Israel, and much more (Profs. Gennady Estraikh, Kathryn Hellerstein , and Hannan Hever). These arrangements allow students to have, if they so choose, an even broader intellectual experience than the already broad interdisciplinary opportunities available to them via the courses offered by the faculty on the Interdisciplinary Committee on Yiddish at Columbia. Language courses need to be taken at Columbia. Honors options: Departmental Honors in Yiddish Studies can be granted to a total of 10% of the students graduating with the Major in Yiddish Studies in a given year across both Columbia College and General Studies. Concentration in German Literature and Cultural History The concentration in German literature and cultural history requires a minimum of 21 points in German courses.

Although the first volume of the Grimms’ Children Stories and Household Tales was published more than 200 years ago, their fairy tales continue to enchant readers. In this course we will not only study the Grimms’ fairy tales themselves, but also examine their origins and their social, ideological, and political contexts in 19th-century Europe. We will work with fairy tale theory (narrative, psychoanalytic, historical) and discuss the function of the tales as folklore as well as their status as children’s literature. Alongside the “original” Grimms’ tales—a concept that we will discuss—a major portion of the course will engage the legacy of the fairy tales and the way they have been appropriated by others, particularly from a critical, feminist perspective. Points of emphasis will include: how writers in the first half of the 20th century politicized the tales in the battle for social change during the time of the Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany; how the tales were reinterpreted in different national traditions and historical periods; how the fairy tale become a mass culture icon in Disney’s film versions; and how contemporary writers like Margaret Atwood continue to employ tales in questioning and challenging traditional constructions of gender.

We will situate major literary innovations of the 18th century in the context of changing reading and theater cultures and focus primarily on Lessing’s innovative domestic tragedy, and on poems and an epistolary novel by Goethe. Then we will discuss the literary production of the 19th century by analyzing changing concepts of art, music and literature during those times of great social and political change. We will study (and translate) poems, and read pamphlets and novellas by Tieck, Kleist, Hölderlin, Novalis, Brentano, Eichendorff, Günderrode, Droste-Hülshoff, Heine, Büchner, Mörike, Keller and Fontane. **This course is taught entirely in German Fall 2022: GERM UN3442 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment GERM 3442 001/12574 M W 4:10pm - 5:25pm Room TBA Dorothea von Muecke 3.00 7/25 GERM UN3675 German Literature In World Context [In English]. 3 points. The course explores how literary texts of the last two centuries have problematized the relationship between the human and its "other" through the portrayal of various kinds of artificial, semi-human beings. From puppets that come alive to automatons that act (almost) like people to monsters that resemble—but also threaten—their human creators: the literary imagination of the Romantic and modern periods is full of creatures that challenge traditional notions of human identity, agency, and sovereignty. We will discuss the literary strategies that serve to stage these challenges and simultaneously ask about the historical conditions that make their emergence possible. Course materials include texts by E.T.A. Hoffmann, Kleist, Brentano, Arnim, Poe, Shelley, Meyrink, Rilke, and others, as well as films by Wegener and Lang.

The senior seminar will focus on one momentous book: Thomas Mann’s breakthrough novel Buddenbrooks (1901), which earned him the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1929. But we will use this book as a prism to explore German society at the height of its power at the turn of the century: the rise of the bourgeoisie in the 19th century, capitalism, anti-Semitism, gender relations, Wagner and Wagnerism. A guiding question will be the relation between storytelling and family life, and to what extent the “decline of a family” implies the demise or even the death of the traditional European realist novel. In addition to Mann’s novel, students will read short texts by Schopenhauer, Wagner, Freud, Kafka and Rilke.

This seminar gives in-depth consideration to shifting ideas and paradigms about race in German culture by tracing their associations with colonialism, slavery, eugenics, Nazism, and the contemporary rise of right-wing populism. In order to explore these evolving and sometimes interrelated notions of race and racism, this seminar brings together a study of anti-Semitism, anti-Blackness, Islamophobia, and other forms of racism. In addition to its study of prejudice, this seminar examines the experiences of minoritized communities in the German-speaking world. How do “non-white” Germans challenge German historical narratives and models of identity? How do discourses of race, discrimination, and solidarity politics contribute to contemporary understandings and misunderstandings of racism in Germany?

Topic/Focus: Feelings , The course offers an introduction to German film since 1945 (in its European contexts) with a focus on ‘feelings.’ Methodologically highlighted by contemporary affect and emotion studies, feelings offer a lens for intersectional, multifaceted investigations of these cinematic histories. We will explore how feelings have been gendered and racialized; how they overlap with matters of sex (as closely associated with political revolt in Western Europe, while considered too private for public articulation in the socialist East, especially when queer); and how they foreground matters of nation and trauma (for example via the notions of German ‘coldness’ and inability to mourn the Holocaust). Simultaneously, the focus on feelings highlights questions of mediality (cinema as a prototypically affective medium?), genre and avant-garde aesthetics: in many films, ‘high-affect’ Hollywood cinema intriguingly meets ‘cold’ cinematic modernism. In pursuing these investigative vectors through theoretical readings and close film analysis, the course connects affect, gender, queer, and cultural studies approaches with cinema studies methodologies. The films discussed span postwar and New German Cinema, East German DEFA productions, the ‘Berlin School’ of the 2000s, and contemporary transnational cinema. , The course is taught in English.

Along with Darwin, Marx, Nietzsche and Freud have radically altered what and how we know; about humans, language, history, religion, things and life. Because their thought has shaped our sense of ourselves so fundamentally, Michel Foucault has referred to these three authors as discourse-founders. As such they will be treated in this class. Special attention will be paid to the affinities and competition among their approaches.

YIDD UN3520 Magic and Monsters in Yiddish Literature [In English]. 3 points. A Serious Man, the 2009 movie by the Coen Brothers opens with a Yiddish folk tale featuring a dybbuk. Dybbuks, golems, magicians, and monsters haunt not only Yiddish literature but also the contemporary cinema, as illustrated by such recent films as The Unborn and The Possession. Why are we so attracted to dybbuks, spirit possession, magic, and monsters in the twenty-first century? This course will focus on magic, monsters, dybbuks, demons, and golems in Yiddish literature and beyond, including film and popular culture. We will approach the supernatural motif from the perspective of gender, body, and performance studies, and will explore the questions of memory, trauma, and identity. The aim of the course is to encourage students to discuss and critically engage with the various texts and film adaptations listed on the syllabus in an attempt to answer the following questions: In what ways do these works explore, interrogate with, and reflect on human experience? What do they tell us about the powers of good and evil? How relevant are they in the twenty-first century? The course puts emphasis on developing the skills of critical, analytical, and abstract thinking in relation to the discussed works, as well as the ability to express that critical thinking in writing. No knowledge of Yiddish required. YIDD GU4995 Exploring Yiddishland: Culture in Time and Space. 3.00 points. Modern Yiddish culture and literature developed and flourished in the so-called Yiddishland, a land without borders located in Eastern Europe across Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Rumania, etc. But the heart of Yiddishland was in prewar Poland: in Warsaw, Vilnius (now Lithuania), Krakow, and Lublin. The course will center on four cities in which Yiddish culture and literature blossomed before the Holocaust, and examine key figures of modern Yiddish literature associated with these places, such as Isaac Bashevis Singer, Kadya Molodowsky, Mordechai Gebirtig, Abraham Sutzkever, Yankev Glatshtayn, and others. Employing gender and comparative approach as analytical lenses, we address the following questions: What role does space play in culture production? How does our familiarity with space impact our perception of literature and culture? The texts and class discussion will be in English. The course will have a digital humanities component: we will engage in Mapping Yiddish Europe through Locus Tempus Fall 2022: YIDD GU4995 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment YIDD 4995 001/12687 T 4:10pm - 6:00pm Room TBA Agnieszka Legutko 3.00 11/25 Of Related Interest Course List Code Title Points German (Barnard) GERM BC3009 News and Views GERM BC3010 Current Issues: Media and Politics in Germany and Austria GERM BC3224 Germany's Traveling Cultures GERM BC3050 German Migrant Literature GERM BC3105 Comical Expression in Multicult Lit/Film Columbia College Columbia University in the City of New York 208 Hamilton Hall, Mail Code 2805 1130 Amsterdam Avenue New York, NY 10027 ColumbiaCollege@columbia.edu Phone: 212-854-2441 College Offices Alumni Affairs and Development Berick Center for Student Advising Center for Career Education Center for the Core Curriculum Center for Undergraduate Global Engagement Double Discovery Center Eric H.
