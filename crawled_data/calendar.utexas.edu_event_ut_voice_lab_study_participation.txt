Researchers in the Voice Lab at The University of Texas at Austin invite individuals with essential tremor to participate in a study of voice. The goals of the study are to understand how speakers control their voice and to develop therapy that improves vocal control. Participants will complete hearing tests, cognitive tests, and voice recordings while they perform different speaking tasks. Nasolaryngoscopy may also be performed.
