Over the decades, the university has continued to be a model of what a land-grant university can and should do. As a university of, for and by the people, Michigan State University began a long tradition of empowering people through educational opportunity. Founding Feb. 12, 1855 Dedication May 13, 1857 First Classes May 14, 1857 – Five faculty members taught 63 students in three now nonexistent buildings: College Hall, Saints’ Rest and a brick horse barn. MSU was the first institution of higher learning in the United States to teach scientific agriculture. Morrill Act 1862 – MSU became the nation’s premier land-grant university and the prototype for the entire land-grant system created when President Abraham Lincoln signed the Morrill Act in 1862. The act granted lands to each loyal state to support a college where the leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and classical studies and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts . . . in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions of life.
