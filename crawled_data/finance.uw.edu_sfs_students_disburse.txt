In most cases, the excess funds will be available in your bank account before the first day of the quarter. You may view your Tuition Statement on MyUW to verify the availability of your aid. If you are not signed up for direct deposit, any refund or financial aid checks will be mailed to your local address on file.

Signing up for direct deposit is strongly encouraged to receive your funds quickly and safely. If you lose your check, or have not cashed it within 90 days of the date it was issued, you can request a replacement by submitting a check affidavit.
