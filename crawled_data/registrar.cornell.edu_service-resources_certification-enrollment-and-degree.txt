Any current student or former student who attended Cornell during or after spring 2009 may use this service. Students will need a valid student ID number and an active NetID and password to make a certification request online. Request certification here if you are a current student. What Services Are Available Obtain an enrollment certificate to print and mail to a health insurer or other company that requests your proof of enrollment. View specific information about your student loans. View the student loan deferment notifications that the Clearinghouse has provided to your loan holders (lenders and guarantors).
