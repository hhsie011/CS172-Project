In addition to coordinating major athletic events such as football and baseball games, many different and sometimes unique events including fraternity and sorority dances, FSU homecoming activities, Flying High Circus, the Presidents Ice Cream Social, guest speakers, footraces, fun runs, fireworks shows, and many others are assisted by the FSU Police Department. The department also assists in a number of community wide events that take place in part or entirely on the Florida State campus such as Cropwalk and Heartwalk. Within the FSU Police Department, the Special Operations Lieutenant, Greg Washington, is responsible for handling and coordinating the departments functions at special events. Requests to have officers at special events are generally required at least two weeks in advance of the planned event. Events at which an admission fee is being charged usually require the presence of one or more officers. Planning an event on campus? Contact: Lt. Greg Washington at 850-644-2900 Sgt.
