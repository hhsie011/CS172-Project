Koh teaches and writes in the areas of criminal law and procedure, international law, and legal theory. A contributor to the Just Security law blog, he provides analysis on U.S. criminal cases with a foreign nexus—an emerging area termed “foreign affairs prosecutions." His publications, which focus on the intersection of U.S. and international criminal law, have appeared in journals such as New York University Law Review, Cornell Law Review, and Columbia Journal of Transnational Law. As a trial attorney in the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), he advised U.S. federal and state prosecutors on international, criminal, and constitutional legal issues arising in U.S. criminal cases with transnational dimensions. At DOJ, he also served as counsel to the Deputy Assistant Attorney General and counselor for International Affairs and participated in multilateral meetings of Attorneys General and Justice Ministers of the Organization of American States (OAS). His international legal experience spans multiple continents, highlighted by positions in two prominent international criminal courts in The Hague, the Netherlands, and as an associate legal officer at the U.N. International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
