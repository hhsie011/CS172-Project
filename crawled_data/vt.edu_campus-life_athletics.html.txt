Whether we’re jumping to “Enter Sandman” at Lane Stadium, celebrating a dunk in Cassell Coliseum, or supporting any of numerous Virginia Tech sports teams, athletic events are often where we gather to show our Hokie Spirit. Hokies succeed in some of the most competitive games in the nation: They’ve been atop the elite Atlantic Coast Conference in many sports and have made numerous NCAA tournament appearances. Catch the Hokie Spirit and learn more about athletic events at Hokie Sports. Students can purchase student tickets or sign up for our student ticket lottery and take a shot at winning free tickets. And you don’t just have to watch from the stands: Take part in the action! With 39 intramural sports, on-campus gyms, aquatic centers, and more than 100 group exercises classes taught each week, our Recreational Sports Department also gives Hokies plenty of options when it comes to breaking a sweat.
