In research published in Physical Biology, the team described how the spots appear during a two-day window, rapidly expand, but then mysteriously stall, leaving a sharp distinction between spots of brown and the still-yellow peel. Undergraduate student, Nicholas Volya, is awarded the 2022 Kolthoff Award from the ACS Division of Analytical Chemistry Student News The I.M. Kolthoff Award is given annually to deserving undergraduates who have done undergraduate research in the field of analytical chemistry, broadly defined, in celebration of the life and accomplishments of the late Professor Izaak Maurits Kolthoff, viewed by many as the father of modern analytical chemistry. FSU chemistry doctoral students awarded DoD SMART scholarships Student News Jason Kuszynski and Catherine Fabiano, students in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, received their awards from the Department of Defense Science, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) Scholarship Program. The awards provide full tuition for up to five years, plus a stipend, mentorship, summer internships and full-time employment with the Department of Defense after graduation.
