Victor Fung Dr. C. Victor Fung Professor of Music Education, University of South Florida, Tampa "Baylor School of Music was where I discovered the world of music education research, in which I set as a foundation for much of my academic career. Its faculty and quality of education have been consistently amazing." C. Victor Fung (Baylor – MM 1990, Indiana University, Bloomington – PhD 1994) is Professor of Music Education and Director of Center for Music Education Research at the University of South Florida, Tampa. He advises doctoral students and teaches graduate courses in social psychology of music, music in higher education, measurement and evaluation in music, and other music education research courses. His research emphasizes social psychological aspects, multicultural issues, and international perspectives of music education. His current projects include senior citizens’ quality of life, meanings of music participation, world musical preferences, and Asian philosophies in music education. He was a Fulbright Researcher in Japan (2018). His books, A Way of Music Education: Classic Chinese Wisdoms (2018) and Music for Life: Music Participation and Quality of Life of Senior Citizens (co-authored with Lisa Lehmberg, 2016), were published by Oxford University Press. He also has published articles in numerous refereed journals and was the editor of Research Perspectives in Music Education, Music Education Research International, and the Research and Scholarship Component of the College Music Symposium. In addition, he has reviewed for ten other professional journals based in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. He has given over a hundred presentations at professional conferences in Australia, Canada, China, Germany, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In addition, he has given open lectures and seminars at over thirty institutions in Brazil, China, Ireland, Japan, Turkey, and the United States. He was a featured keynote presenter at professional meetings in China, Japan, and Mexico. He served as a Board Member for the International Society for Music Education, the College Music Society, and Florida Music Education Association.
