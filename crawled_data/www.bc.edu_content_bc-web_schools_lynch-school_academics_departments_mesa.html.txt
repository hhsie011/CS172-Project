Our coursework blends theory and application, preparing students for careers in government, testing organizations, nonprofits, and schools. MESA Mission Statement Drawing on the Lynch School aspiration to â€œenhance the human condition, to expand the human imagination, and to make the world more just," the mission of the MESA program is to: Contribute to national and international efforts to solve critical educational and human problems in a diverse global community Educate the next generation of scholars and practitioners who will engage in reflective social inquiry Foster meaningful scholarly inquiry into both theoretical and applied aspects of social systems Advance creative approaches to important measurement, evaluation, and research problems in educational and other social science fields Provide students with the necessary theoretical and applied skills and experience to become research and evaluation leaders in their professional fields Prepare students to make original and substantive contributions to the fields of measurement, evaluation, and statistics In service of this mission: The MESA program is committed to high quality, rigorous, collaborative, and equity-minded research, teaching, and mentoring The MESA program trains students in state-of-the-art statistical, research, and evaluation methods Students in MESA develop expertise in research methodology, measurement, evaluation, and applied statistics MESA faculty members have expertise in classroom and large-scale assessment, measurement and item response theory, factor analysis and structural equation modeling, categorical data analysis, multilevel modeling, generalized linear models, program evaluation, psychometrics, etc. Graduates of the MESA program find employment in colleges, universities, research centers, testing agencies, school systems, ministries of education and other government agencies, and industry Students completing the doctoral/master's degrees are capable of conducting independent research and evaluation, constructing measurement instruments, analyzing and interpreting quantitative and qualitative data, and contributing to the theory of research and evaluation methodology The Boston College Environment Students engaging in Measurement, Evaluation, Statistics and Assessment programs benefit considerably from the location of Boston College. Boston as a city is one of the richest post-secondary environments in the world, and offers a diverse range of educational environments. The Boston College O'Neill Library has an excellent collection of books and journals in higher education and educational leadership resulting from decades of focus in the field. The university offers strong supporting faculty in education, management, and the social sciences, and a strong tradition of collaborative scholarship. Close relations with other academic institutions in the area mean extensive opportunities for internships and research around the metropolitan area. Boston College's Jesuit identity also offers an underlying concern with social justice issues that is unique among education programs, and of course the program benefits from the Jesuit tradition of rigorous intellectual discourse. Frequently Asked Questions Do I need a math background for the MESA program? A degree or other background in math is not required for admission to the MESA program. Some MESA students have a moderate math or statistics background, and a few students have a deep math or statistics background. Your bachelorâ€™s or master's degree may be in any field. We have had students with backgrounds in music, business, sociology, psychology, etc. The critical issue is your interest and intentions with attaining this form of specialized training. Do I need an education background for the MESA program? Nearly all MESA students have some education background. For admission to MESA, teaching experience and/or an education degree is not required, but some exposure to important issues in education is a benefit. Of more interest to us is what you want to study and research while in the program and what you want to do when you graduate. Do I need a master's degree to apply for the MESA Ph.D. program? No, you can apply to the Ph.D. program with a bachelorâ€™s degree only. This is considered applying for the Direct Admit Ph.D. degree. This route is available for the occasional BA/BS student who has a strong undergraduate quantitative research background. It is 72 credits, which is 12 credits less than the normal 30 credit M.Ed. degree and 54 credit Ph.D. programs combined. What is the biggest difference between the MESA M.Ed., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees? One way to think of the M.Ed. and M.S. degrees versus the Ph.D. degree is what you plan to do with what you learn. If you want to become a more informed and critical reader of research and to develop more sensitive assessment and evaluation skills as a teacher or other education/social science professional, then the M.Ed. is a good choice. The M.S. prepares you for a career in applied statistics or psychometrics. If you are thinking of a significant career change in the sense of becoming a full-time graduate student with goals of becoming an independent consultant, director of institutional research, or college professor of measurement, etc. then the doctoral degree is the way to go. If you are unsure, it is best to request a meeting with the department chair, Dr. Larry Ludlow, to discuss your interests.
