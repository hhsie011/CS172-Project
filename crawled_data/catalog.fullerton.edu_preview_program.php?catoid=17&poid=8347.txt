All courses must be passed with a “C” (2.0) or better. Those seeking careers in the health professions should speak to a health professions adviser about specific course recommendations. For more information, visit: fullerton.edu/health_professions.

The upper-division program requires at least six units of laboratory- or field-based activities, six units of 400-level biology courses and two units of a specified capstone course. Students with junior or senior standing will be permitted to enroll in BIOL 480 , BIOL 482 , BIOL 495 , BIOL 498 and BIOL 499L . However, no more than a combined total of six units of BIOL 480 (2 units maximum), BIOL 482 (2 units maximum), BIOL 495 (3 units maximum), BIOL 498 (2 units maximum) and BIOL 499L (6 units maximum) shall be counted toward the 21 upper-division biology units required for the major, and no more than three of these units may count toward the requirement to complete at least six units of upper-division biology laboratory/field electives. Supporting Course Requirements for the Major (34 units) Math MATH 130 - A Short Course in Calculus (4) and MATH 338 - Statistics Applied to Natural Sciences (4) or MATH 150A - Calculus I (4) and MATH 150B - Calculus II (4) Chemistry CHEM 120A - General Chemistry (5) CHEM 120B - General Chemistry (5) CHEM 301A - Organic Chemistry (3) CHEM 301B - Organic Chemistry (3) CHEM 302 - Organic Chemistry Laboratory (2) or CHEM 302A - Organic Chemistry Laboratory (1) and CHEM 302B - Organic Chemistry Laboratory (1) Physics PHYS 211 - Elementary Physics (3) PHYS 211L - Elementary Physics: Laboratory (1) PHYS 212 - Elementary Physics (3) PHYS 212L - Elementary Physics: Laboratory (1) Concentration in Plant Biology Required Course (3 units) BIOL 345 - Plant Biology (3) Electives (7 units minimum) BIOL 340 - Field Botany (3) BIOL 344 - Survey of the Land Plants (4) BIOL 441 - Plant Taxonomy (4) BIOL 442 - Pollination Biology (3) BIOL 443 - Plant Ecology (4) BIOL 444 - Plant Physiological Ecology (4) BIOL 445 - Plant Cell Physiology (3) BIOL 446 - Marine Phycology (4) BIOL 447 - Ethnobotany (3) BIOL 448 - Plant Molecular Biology (4) BIOL 449 - Desert Ecology (4) GEOG 313 - Natural Vegetation (3) Capstone Courses (2 units minimum) BIOL 450 - Conservation Biology (3) BIOL 482 - Capstone Studies in Biology (2) BIOL 495 - Biological Internship (3) BIOL 498 - Senior Thesis (1-2) BIOL 499L - Independent Laboratory Study (1-3) Laboratory/Field Requirement Three of the required laboratory/field units must be completed within the courses taken to fulfill concentration requirements. Physiology One course in physiology is required. This can be met by taking one of the following as a Free Upper-Division Biology Elective or as part of the concentration if one of the courses below is listed as an option to fulfill a concentration requirement.
