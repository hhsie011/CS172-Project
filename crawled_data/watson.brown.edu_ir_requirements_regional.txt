There is no list of courses that fulfill the regional requirement. Regional courses typically come from history, sociology, political science, economics, anthropology, religious studies, relevant advanced-level area studies courses, or INTL1800 senior seminars. Taking a general thematic course and writing a paper on a country or region does not fulfill the regional requirement. Courses in area studies or language and literature departments must be 1000-level or higher in order to qualify and be thematically relevant—for example, "War in France,” "Democratization in Spain," or "French Nationalism." Courses must focus on the modern period (ancient history, for example, does not count). Broad thematic courses (such as AIDS in Developing Countries) do not fulfill this requirement. Language training (courses used to fulfill level 600 or advanced language competency), literature survey courses, performance, and lab courses do not meet the regional requirement. Students who study abroad their junior year often seek IR concentration credit for at least one regional course taken while abroad. There is no pre-approved course list for this requirement. However, courses should focus on the modern period and must be approved by the concentration advisor. Both regional courses must be on the same region. Students are required to link these to language study, though the course need not be taught in that language.
