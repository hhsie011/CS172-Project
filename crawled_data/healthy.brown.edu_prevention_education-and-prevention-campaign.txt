Essential to the healthy daily life of any community, and especially to a campus community with thousands of students and employees, is the presence of robust and effective prevention and public health education efforts. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020, the University continues to partner with students, faculty and staff to carry out a successful education and prevention campaign known as Brown Takes Care. The campaign uses a variety of tools and communication channels — including social media, video, digital ads, community activities and a range of physical and digital signage — to promote healthy behaviors and vaccination and share important information with the campus community. Brown Takes Care Brown Takes Care is a community effort that calls on each of us to embrace behaviors that support healthy ways of working, socializing and living, including receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Visit the Website Campus-Wide Effort The Brown Takes Care initiative is aligned and integrated with a holistic education and prevention effort across the University that encompasses: Brown’s COVID-19 Campus Safety Policy; A testing and tracing program; and The University’s requirement to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and document verification of the receipt of vaccination. Given the complexities of maintaining health in the residential student population, students are important participants in the implementation of public health education efforts. Students have played a key role in the Brown Takes Care initiative throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, as interns (through the President’s Office), peer health educators, Residential Peer Leaders, Orientation student leaders and members of student government.
