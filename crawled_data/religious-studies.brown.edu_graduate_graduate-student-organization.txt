We are committed to actively developing the RS program through skill-based workshops on teaching, negotiating the academic job market, and broader conceptual issues in the academic study of religion. We also work with the Departmental Undergraduate Group to reach out across Brown's campus, putting on public events that help develop critical awareness concerning questions of religion in the global context.
