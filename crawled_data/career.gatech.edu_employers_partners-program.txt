Georgia Tech's students are keenly sought out by employers because of our national collegiate ranking, and our sponsorship program is designed to allow you expedited access to a future employment pool of engaged individuals. Partnerships are limited in number, particularly at the Executive Level, and provide a new and productive vehicle for reaching your key student audience. Each year, thousands of Georgia Tech students participate in the center's programs and sponsored events. These programs are designed to help students better prepare for the world of work and be more productive employees. Without funds from our partners most of our programs would not be possible. Employers often ask how to increase their visibility with students while aiding our outreach. Here are some ways we've designed to achieve these goals. If you are interested in becoming a partner, please contact Richard South at r.south@gatech.edu or 404-894-2554.
