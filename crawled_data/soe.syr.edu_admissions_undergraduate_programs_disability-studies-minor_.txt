This interdisciplinary program in the Department of Cultural Foundations of Education explores disability as a social and cultural phenomenon across of law, policy, identity, education, geography, history, sociology, anthropology, intersectionality, representation, and technology. “I am minoring in Disability Studies because I am interested in how disability is perceived and constructed within our society. With this minor, I can actively work to shift the misconceptions and misinformation surrounding disability in our schools.” – Patricia Maciolek ‘19, Inclusive Elementary and Special Education Major Minor Requirements The Disability Studies minor requires 18 credits, with at least 4 total courses with a DSP prefix, and at least 4 total courses at the 300 level or above. Classes may include disability and its intersection with popular culture, gender, race, class, aging, community, diversity, politics, social contexts, and technology. Students will choose their courses to fit these requirements with the disability studies minor program advisor. More information on academic requirements available in the Syracuse University Course Catalog.
