Whether or not you end up winning an award, the process of developing an application will help you clarify your purpose and goals moving forward. Here is what some of our past candidates have to say. Allen Wang 2017 Goldwater Scholar 2018 Stanford Knight-Hennessy Finalist 2018 NSF Graduate Research Fellow "Of course, you should hope to win, but this process is about a lot more than just that. It's a wonderful exercise in explaining and understanding more about yourself and, for certain awards, getting connected to some awesome people. In the long run, I believe a lot more fulfillment and success will come from developing as a person than from having an extra certificate hanging on my wall." Zoey Mauck 2018 Udall Scholar "Through this process, I gained skills in articulating my story, my research, and my future goals. Students should look at this experience as an investment in their development. Spend the time to write and talk to mentors, and you will end up with a clearer idea of your future path." Collin Powell 2019 Fulbright Scholar "At first, applying for a competitive award seemed daunting. I had no idea where to begin, and I felt completely lost. The Nationally Competitive Awards team at ISU was able to help me funnel my thoughts into a cohesive, thorough statement and ultimately guided me to the Fulbright program as a great pairing for my international aspirations. Having the opportunity to travel to Austria to study, teach English, and work with refugee populations on housing seems like a dream come true, but I know all the work began here on campus." Majd Abdulghani 2019 Rhodes Scholar "In the process of applying to a national award, I gained first and foremost a better understanding of myself and my goals. I also learned how to articulate myself and how to communicate better. Even if I hadn't received the scholarship, that experience has been invaluable. To future applicants, I say, have fun with the application! It's intense, but rewarding and enjoyable. To get the most out of it, though, start early!"
