University Core Renewal Committee The University Core Renewal Committee (UCRC) coordinates and manages the Boston College Core Curriculum. Composed of sixteen faculty, administrative, and student representatives, the committee is leading university-wide efforts to renew the Core Curriculum as a vital part of a Boston College undergraduate education. It promotes interdepartmental and faculty/staff collaboration and innovation. In 2017–2018, the UCRC is focusing on two priorities: systematizing the Core that has existed since 1991, and managing the third year of Core Renewal Pilot classes and preparing for a forth round in 2018–2019. Different subcommittees of the UCRC address Core Renewal pilot classes, curriculum, and assessment.
