Administrative Unit Directors, Teaching Assistants FROM: John Karl Scholz, Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs Lori Reesor, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Heather Daniels, Secretary of the Faculty RE: Religious and Election Day Observances We write to remind you of UW-Madison’s religious observances policy and to highlight faculty legislation regarding Election Day observances. State law mandates that any student with a conflict between an academic requirement and any religious observance must be given an alternative for meeting the academic requirement. A student’s claim of a religious conflict, which may include travel time, should be accepted at face value. There is no practical, dignified, or legal means to assess individual claims. As you finalize your summer term syllabi, we encourage you whenever possible to avoid scheduling conflicts between examinations or other major course activities and religious observances. Please indicate in your syllabus and announce to your students that when conflicts do arise, you and your teaching assistants will follow UW-Madison policy and provide accommodations. _______________________________________________________________________________________________ Election observances: Students must inform instructors at least two weeks prior to Election Day about their commitment as election officials. Students will not receive a grade deduction for not attending class, and instructors will attempt to keep election days free of major assignments. Guidelines 2 and 3 listed below for religious observances are also applicable to election observances. Please provide flexibility to students reporting they may be tardy or absent the day of an election due to waiting to vote at the polls. _______________________________________________________________________________________________ The following guidelines are intended to provide clarity for both students and instructors: Announce to students early in the semester that they must notify you within the first two weeks of class which dates they request relief due to a religious observation or election official responsibility. Include this information on your course syllabus by referring to the policy or using the recommended course syllabus template (teachlearn.provost.wisc.edu/course-syllabi/), where a link to the religious observances policy is included. Make-ups may be scheduled before or after the regularly scheduled requirements. Instructors may set reasonable limits on the total number of days claimed by any student. Occasionally, students may not fully understand the necessity for prior notice, and under these circumstances we urge you to be as flexible as possible. Our policy is meant to be sensitive to the needs of individual students. Please refer to the following calendar for a listing, though not exhaustive, of religious observances, election days and cultural observances. Note that some religions mark observances over multiple days, which may begin at sunset on the day preceding the posted date(s) of the holiday. The list should not be taken as an indication of what occasions merit accommodation but as a base for understanding potential scheduling conflicts. This calendar is also available online at secfac.wisc.edu/academic-calendar and as a shared Outlook calendar named “SoF Academic Calendar & Religious Observances.” If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact: Heather Daniels, Secretary of the Faculty, 608-262-3958, sof@secfac.wisc.edu John Zumbrunnen, Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning, 608-262-5701, zumbrunnen@wisc.edu Christina Olstad, Dean of Students, 608-262-1451, dean@studentlife.wisc.edu CALENDAR FOR SUMMER SEMESTER 2022 Faculty contract year ends 22 May (Sun) 4-week summer session begins 23 May (Mon) Declaration of the Báb (Baha’i) 23 May (Mon) Western Ascension Day (Christian) 26 May (Thu) Ascension of Baha’u’llah (Baha’i) 29 May (Sun) Memorial Day observed 30 May (Mon) 3-week summer session begins 31 May (Tue) Eastern Orthodox Ascension Day 2 June (Thu) Shavuot (Jewish) 4-6 June (Sat-Mon)* Pentecost Sunday (Christian) 5 June (Sun) 3-week and 4-week summer sessions end 17 June (Fri) 8-week summer session begins 20 June (Mon) Juneteenth 19 June (Sun) Independence Day observed 4 July (Mon) Eid al-Adha (Islamic) 9-10 July (Mon-Fri)** Asalha Puja (Buddhist) 13 July (Wed) Awal Muharram (Islamic) 29-30 July (Fri-Sat)** Tisha B’av (Jewish) 5-6 August (Friday-Sat)* Election day 9 August (Tue) 8-week summer session ends 12 August (Fri) Obon (Japanese, Buddhist) 13-15 August (Sat-Mon) Assumption (Christian) 15 August (Mon) Krishna Janmashtami (Hindu) 18-19 August (Thu-Fri) Faculty contract year begins 22 August (Mon) Summer 2022 Key Deadlines: registrar.wisc.edu/dates Please contact the Office of the Registrar for the Apply to Graduate deadline. * Observances of Jewish holidays begin at sunset on the day preceding that which is listed as the holiday. ** Islamic holidays are based on the lunar cycle, and dates may vary by one day from those listed.
