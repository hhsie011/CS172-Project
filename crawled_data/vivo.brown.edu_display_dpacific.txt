Domenico has been the recipient of a Richard B. Salomon Faculty Research Award, three Brown Research Seed Awards, a Dedicated Faculty Award from Brown’s School of Engineering and Tau Beta Pi, and a Henry Merritt Wriston Fellowship “for his contributions to excellence in teaching and for the devotion to the intellectual development of both graduate and undergraduate students.” His research efforts have focused on the opto-electronic properties of erbium doped silicon quantum dots for silicon-based microphotonics and fundamental light-matter interactions at the nanometer-scale for biosensing and energy harvesting applications. His research group has pioneered the field of plasmonic interferometry and received grants from the National Science Foundation, from the Office of Naval Research, and from the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. Domenico is currently a CNST Visiting Fellow in the Nanofabrication Research Group at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and a Visiting Associate Professor at the University of Maryland College Park, in the Institute for Research In Electronics & Applied Physics (IREAP). Domenico is currently working with Dr. Henri Lezec (NIST Fellow and Project Leader) on photon drag detection, negative optical pressure, and the development of active materials for implementation of novel plasmonic lasers and electrically-pumped plasmon sources.

Full Text Research Research Overview Professor Pacifici and his research group are currently leading research projects involving the use of photons and surface plasmons in nanostructured materials for optoelectronics, sensing and energy-harvesting applications. Research Statement We live in a society based on massive information exchange and energy consumption. Indeed, the typical data transfer rate in optical fiber networks is of the order of tens of terabits per second (Tb/s). On the other hand, the worldwide energy consumption is currently estimated to be greater than 14 terawatts (TW), averaged annually, and is expected to exceed 30 TW by 2050. In order to meet the ever growing worldwide data and energy demands, new approaches and paradigm-shifting strategies are needed to overcome the intrinsic limitation of current technologies. Our group intends to understand the fundamental physical laws and explore alternative approaches in the following research areas: Energy harvesting, Optical communication, and Biochemical sensing. Energy Solar energy is an accessible, abundant, and sustainable form of energy with average usable insolation estimated to be several times our current worldwide needs. In conventional photovoltaic devices, the photogenerated charge carriers are collected in the same direction as light is absorbed. Therefore, active layers must be optically thick to enable full light absorption, and at the same time have high crystallinity and purity to allow for efficient photocarrier collection. Solar cell design and material synthesis considerations are strongly dictated by this simple optical thickness requirement, which increases the cost of the photovoltaic module. Reducing the absorber layer thickness by several orders of magnitude (from 10-100 μm down to 10-100 nm) could significantly expand the range and quality of absorber materials that are suitable for photovoltaic devices. Our goal is to demonstrate efficient solar cells that show enhanced energy-harvesting properties. Among other solutions, we propose to employ the high confinement properties of surface plasmon polaritons at metal-dielectric interfaces to increase the optical absorption and carrier extraction in thin photovoltaic materials. This work will help circumvent the cost/efficiency trade-off of conventional photovoltaic technologies, leading to efficient and cost-effective solar cells. Information Photonic networks with sophisticated functions have the potential to solve problems such as crosstalk, power dissipation, and speed limitations that microelectronics circuits are soon expected to face, and at the same time offer the opportunity for low-cost and high-volume fast communication, new computing schemes, and data-storage solutions. We propose to employ nanoscale plasmonic structures to guide, concentrate and modulate light on the surface of a monolithic integrated-circuit. Our goal is to develop the basic building blocks for photonic circuits and networks that operate at the nanoscale. The proposed work will attempt to integrate plasmonic, electronic and photonic devices on the same chip, exploiting the strengths of each technology. This research activity will enable unprecedented guiding and routing capabilities of optical signals in compact devices, with 100 times smaller area than conventional dielectric waveguides, component footprint less than 45 nm, and switch energies in the order of femtojoules to attojoules, comparable to state-of-the-art microelectronic transistors. Sensing Propagating surface plasmon polaritons and localized surface plasmons can be used to enhance detection of chemical or biological analytes by monitoring binding events of molecules to chemically-functionalized continuous metal films. Typical implementations of plasmonic sensor devices rely on non-scalable approaches, which make use of bulky and expensive prisms and optical components to evanescently couple an incident laser beam and generate a propagating surface plasmon, and monitor a variation in refractive index via a change in the incoupling angle. Our goal is to integrate thousands of biochemical sensors in a single, compact, lab-on-a-chip device. The proposed approach will allow quantitative and qualitative detection of multiple analyte species with an estimated sensitivity to refractive index change better than 1 part per million, and provide a powerful tool for protein-DNA binding studies.
