We must also begin to plan for the financial impacts of the coronavirus. I am deeply grateful for the tremendous effort that has been made by faculty and staff in transitioning to the online delivery of instruction. And now, I must also ask for your continued cooperation and support as we implement plans to reimburse students and cover payroll costs for exempt and hourly employees, at the same time that we sustain revenue losses, particularly in our auxiliary operations. In the coming weeks, we will review many aspects of our budgetary process, but at this time, we need to revise our hiring practices. We will communicate a more detailed procedure to Deans, Chairs, and supervisors, but I want to share the main aspects of our plan with everyone. The hiring process may continue for searches that have been certified by the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion or have selected a final pool of candidates that have been interviewed or have scheduled virtual interviews. For all other vacant positions, we will initiate a central review of hiring requests. Our priority in approving new hires will be to maximize funding resources that support our academic enterprise. A committee consisting of Chief Financial Officer Noel Sloan, Chief of Staff Grace Hernandez, and Provost Michael Galyean will review all requests for hires to determine whether the position is critical at this time. We will share additional instructions related to the process in the near future that will describe how a request should be submitted and coordinated at the college level. The opportunity to appear before the committee to make a case for a proposed hire will be provided. As we deal with budgetary challenges that will likely affect us for months to come, we must all work toward responsibly stewarding our funds. I ask everyone with budget oversight to consider other cost-saving measures, with a focus on travel, meals, and entertainment. I appreciate your understanding and continued cooperation. Thank you for all you do on behalf of Texas Tech University.
