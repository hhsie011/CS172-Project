It was not until I started working in the athletic training that I found my passion. I am truly thankful to the SMU Athletic Training Staff for helping to further my knowledge as well as their support in my future as an athletic trainer.” – Taylor Bowker Marsh & McLennan Agency “Working as the Health and Wellness intern at Marsh & McLennan Agency has been one of the most influential experiences of my life. I really enjoyed being given so many different types of tasks and projects because I felt that I was able to gain a lot more experience and knowledge that way.” – Brooke Kuempel UT Southwestern Medical Center “The roles and tasks I was given this summer gave me opportunities to learn beyond my scope of knowledge, held me to high standards of expectations and gave me undeserving autonomy. I never once felt like the intern pushing paper.” – Maddie McCredie Clinical Center for Multiple Sclerosis at the University of Texas – Southwestern “I’ve been able to experience medicine from both the clinical and the research perspective. I’ve also been extremely lucky in that I’ve had an amazing mentor teaching me about medicine and the basics of being a clinician.” – Braeden Newton DNA Stat “It was so amazing being able to apply the knowledge I’ve learned at SMU this far to real-world patients, have a decent understanding of what’s going on in their bodies, and to intelligently be able to discuss their cases with a nurse practitioner.” – Cayenne Price Previous Next pause play hide show The Applied Physiology and Health Management specialization equips students with the skills to design research-based training methods for the development of effective lifestyle prescriptions and to design and manage fitness and health facilities for a rapidly-growing aging population. The gateway courses required to be considered for the major in APSM with a Applied Physiology and Health Management specialization are APSM 2441- Human Anatomy and Physiology 1 with lab and APSM 3343- Health Promotion Practice. The course offerings within this concentration focus on holistic fitness and health outcomes and are formulated and presented around the central theme of evidence-based practice. This strategy endows students with the analytic skills necessary to evaluate and properly incorporate research results into professional practice. The Applied Physiology and Health Management specialization provides students with the solid research foundation that is necessary for leaders, educators and practitioners in the prevention of chronic diseases that plague our society and cripple our health care budget. The required introductory course for students interested in applying for the APHM specialization is APSM 2441: Human Anatomy and Physiology with lab. Academic coursework and experiential learning opportunities within this specialization prepare students for a variety of possible career paths including: *For many of the following career possibilities, additional coursework will be required. For details, see an Applied Physiology and Health Management adviser. Exercise Physiologist within all types of Fitness Centers Research Scientist and Research Associate* Directors, General Managers of Fitness Centers-Corporate, Hospital-based ( e.g. Finley-Ewing, Tom Landry, non-profits-YMCA) Brokers for health insurances to fund/subsidize wellness/fitness programs with companies Owner /Director of private small fitness enterprises - studios, clinics Spa Director with emphasis in the fitness programming Program Directors within all types of Fitness Centers Personal Trainer - within a club, your own business, specialized to different populations* Cardiac Rehabilitation* Technicians for fitness testing Medical Doctor/Orthopedic/Cardiologist/ Physician's Assistant* Sales of medical, performance, or products (equipment or nutritional products, apparel) Physical Therapy-private to targeted groups, sports medicine centers, performance centers, occupational* Athletic Trainer* Fitness consultant and writer for journals, magazines and websites Sports Performance trainer - sports performance centers and teams Nutritionist with a Master's and a RD (Registered Dietician)* Product development for fitness apparel and fitness equipment Marketing Analyst for fitness products and action sports and following current market trends Social Media director for fitness and health organizations Physicians Assistant Nursing Students selecting the specialization of Applied Physiology and Health Management within the Applied Physiology and Sport Management major will find that the two primary content areas of science and management are integrated by the organizing principle of evidence-based practice, which parallels the mission of the Simmons School of Education and Human Development to integrate theory, research and practice.
