Brown University does not accept credit card payments for student account charges. Electronic ACH Payments: Students and their Authorized Users can access the E-Bill & Payment system at http://payment.brown.edu to make online ACH payments via a U.S. personal checking or savings account. View the eBill & Payment Guide for additional instructions. Electronic ACH payments will post to the student’s account immediately and may take up to 48 business hours to post against the payer's bank account. International Wire Transfers: Flywire is Brown University's preferred method of payment for international student account payments. The University has partnered with Flywire to offer a streamlined and cost saving payment method. With this partnership, students and families are offered favorable foreign exchange rates, the ability to pay in home currency (in most cases) and savings compared to traditional banks. In addition, students/families are able to track payments via Flywire's dashboard and receive notification via email (and/or text) when the payment is received by Brown University. Visit Brown.flywire.com to make an international student account payment. Check Payments and Domestic Wire Transfers: All check payments and domestic bank wire transfers must be sent to the Cashier’s Office. Do not send payments directly to the Bursar Office. Checks should be made payable in US dollars, as differences in exchange rates and bank collection charges will be charged to the student account. Post-dated checks will not be accepted. Third party checks will not be accepted with the exception of checks from banks, trusts and investment companies purposely set up to fund a student's education. Overpayments: Brown University will only accept payments to cover educational expenses that appear on the student account. Brown reserves the right to return any overpayments directly to the originating bank or the student/payer may opt to keep the credit on the account to cover future charges. For further details on Student Payment Information, visit our Cashier Office website. _______________________________________________________________ Financing Options Financing the cost of an education requires thoughtful planning and research to determine what will work best for the student and their family’s budget.
