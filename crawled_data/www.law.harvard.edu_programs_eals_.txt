East Asian Legal Studies at Harvard Law School EALS Home | EALS Events | EALS Faculty & Staff | EALS Visiting Scholars | EALS Visiting Scholar program About EALS East Asian Legal Studies is the United States’ oldest academic program devoted to the study of the law and legal history of the nations and peoples of East Asia and their interaction with the United States. The program was created in 1965 in response to increasing interest among lawyers and scholars of international and comparative law in the legal cultures of China, Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia. The Law School offers instruction on the legal systems of East Asia and sponsors in-depth research conducted by scholars in residence. Joint programs of study can also be arranged on an individual basis with other parts of Harvard University. An active extracurricular program includes a lunchtime speaker series that combines lectures and discussions on Asian legal themes in an informal setting, a workshop series providing a more formal setting for the presentation of research projects, and foreign language discussion groups on legal issues. EALS is directed by William P. Alford and guided by a faculty advisory committee which includes Professor Alford, Professor Mark Ramseyer, and Professor Mark Wu. It is funded by independent grants and charitable contributions.
