If May '68 shifted attitudes towards sex, what new worlds of sex have emerged during the last 50 years? This conference brings together a diverse range of perspectives from literature, social theory, history and philosophy to consider questions of sex and gender, queer and trans theory, body and desire and the new worlds of robots and sex and how our worlds of sex have been transformed and challenged since '68. Speakers include: Michèle Idels, Co-directrice des éditions Des femmes, Paris Elsa Dorlin, Professor of Political and Social Philosophy, Vincennes/St. Denis Paris 8 University Bee Scherer, Professor of Religious Studies & Gender Studies and Director of Intersectional Centre for Inclusion and Social Justice, Canterbury Christchurch University Declan Gilmore-Kavanagh, Senior lecturer in Eighteenth-Century Studies and Director of the Centre for Gender, Sexuality, and Writing, University of Kent, UK Jeremy Carrette, Professor of Philosophy, Religion & Culture, University of Kent, UK Loren Wolfe, Columbia University, Paris Alex Goody, Professor of English, Oxford Brookes University, UK In partnership with Upcoming Events Columbia Global CentersAmman / Beijing / Istanbul / Mumbai / Nairobi / Paris / Rio / Santiago / Tunis Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
