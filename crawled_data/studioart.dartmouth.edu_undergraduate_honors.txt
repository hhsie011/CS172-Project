To be eligible for the Honors Program, students must have achieved the following, by the end of junior year: a 3.4 average in all Studio Art Major courses; a 3.0 average in Dartmouth College courses Drawing I and Drawing II; and three terms of study in a specific area of architecture, drawing, painting, photography, printmaking, sculpture (e.g., Sculpture I, Sculpture II, and Sculpture III). By the end of senior fall term, students must: have one professor who will advise them on their honors project throughout Senior Seminar; submit a typed proposal outlining their final project, along with 10 images of their work. These pieces must have been initiated on your own, and not as part of a class assignment. A critique of this independent work will take place between Honors Program participants and the general faculty. Studio Art majors will be notified in writing of procedures for Honors. At the end of winter term, faculty will review all Honors students' work and determine whether or not their work is acceptable to continue in the program. An honors thesis is required by the end of spring term. Honors, if granted, is bestowed at the end of spring term.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Dartmouth Studio Art Department Undergraduate Overview Major Minor Honors Senior Seminar Art Awards Awards News 2020 Award Recipients Diversity Disciplines Overview Architecture Drawing Painting Photography Printmaking Sculpture Special Topics Visual Arts Digital Lab Artists in Residence Overview Current Artist in Residence Past Artists in Residence News About the Artists Artist-in-Residence Talks Exhibitions Overview Jaffe-Friede Gallery Past Exhibitions Barrows Rotunda Past Exhibitions Strauss Gallery Past Exhibitions Student Gallery Past Exhibitions Nearburg Gallery Internships Overview Current Interns Intern Exhibitions Apply for an Internship News & Events Overview Lectures Faculty News Students News Alumni Stories Tell us Your Story Videos & Links People Overview Visiting Faculty and Critics My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
