It provides a unique mentoring opportunity for local youth, called Littles, who would benefit from a positive adult role model. Littles, from the communities of Harlem, Washington Heights, and Morningside Heights, are paired with BIGS from Columbia or Barnard who build a big brother/sister relationship. Growing together, sharing experiences, and developing trust and friendship provides Littles with stable, ongoing companionship. Big SIBS requires a minimum two-year commitment with weekly outings lasting 3-5 hours. Sessions are every Sunday from 10:00am - 2:00pm.
