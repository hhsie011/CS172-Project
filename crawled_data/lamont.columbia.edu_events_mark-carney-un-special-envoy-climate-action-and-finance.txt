Janow Dean of the School of International and Public Affairs Achieving the objective agreed in the Paris Agreement to limit global temperature increases to 1.5°C requires wholesale structural change. We need credible government policy, net-zero plans from companies and all forms of finance—public, private and blended capital—to transform economies. With recent action from governments and major commitments from private finance to align all their lending and investment with net zero, we are on the cusp of realizing a sustainable revolution. In this talk, Mark Carney, UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance will discuss the quantum of capital required for the transition, the finance available for investment today, and the structures and markets we need to develop to unlock financial flows to the projects and countries where it is needed most. The Climate Group has selected the Columbia Climate School as its university partner for this year’s Climate Week NYC. Running September 20-26, Climate Week NYC convenes key climate leaders to accelerate climate action and discuss ambitious commitments ahead of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference, or COP26, later this fall in Glasgow. Columbia University students are invited to participate in a moderated question and answer session following the discussion. Cosponsored by Columbia Climate School, Center on Global Energy Policy, and School of International and Public Affairs. *For the general public, this event will also be livestreamed on the World Leaders Forum website.
