His vibrant images depict overflowing buckets, a rain drenched abstracted head with large pink eyes and two organic cones, which he calls "beacons.” Hancock’s paintings, drawings and prints work together to tell the story of his idiosyncratic cast of characters and their ongoing mythological battles. For this series, Hancock used a range of print media including etching, screenprint and airbrushed watercolor to achieve a dynamic range of tonal shifts. Prints, for Hancock, “are motors to get to the next work. In between working on paintings, I use prints to bring together formal systems and overlapping motifs to create new imagery and elaborate on ideas." Hancock (b. 1974) earned a BFA from Texas A&M University in 1997 where he was the lead cartoonist for the university paper and received a MFA from the Tyler School of Art in 2000. His work was included in the 2000 and 2002 Whitney Biennial exhibitions and the subject of a major exhibition at MASS MoCA, North Adams, MA in 2019. Hancock’s work is in the permanent collections of institutions including the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; and the Menil Collection, Houston among others.
