Confronting Anti-Asian Racism Contemplative Studies honors the people and cultures of Asia from whom we take the inspiration for the unique perspectives of our field. From them, we take seriously the premise that contemplative experience must fully and critically inform our studies of human nature and the social and environmental contexts we inhabit.
