Throughout its many incarnations, the aim of our center has been to provide peer-to-peer instruction that enhances Dartmouth students’ intellectual work at every stage of their thinking, research, and composing processes. The story of Dartmouth’s support for student writing outside the classroom begins with The Dartmouth College Committee on Student English, 1947-1959, which suggested and created a Writing Clinic, where struggling writers could go for help. In the mid 1960s the Clinic was disbanded at the recommendation of Albert Kitzhaber’s report. By 1975, the English Department had created the Composition Center, a peer-tutoring program, and, in 1986, the Center began a small Writing Assistance Program, which offered writing assistants to faculty who wanted trained assistants to work with their students’ papers. In 1988, the college hired a Director of Composition who was charged with the responsibilities of overseeing the Composition Center and its programs. In the year after this appointment, the college provided the Director with the financial resources necessary to further develop the Composition Center’s Peer Tutoring and Writing Assistance Programs. As a result of this investment, the support programs for composition grew exponentially, from a very small student-run program to professional programs that came to serve nearly one-quarter of Dartmouth undergraduates. In 2003, the Composition Center collaborated with the Library and Academic Computing to conceptualize a new kind of center. Using Composition Center tutors and a few technically-competent staff from the Jones Media Center, the collaborators launched a pilot tutoring program designed to offer students help with their multimedia projects, as well as their papers and research projects. When the College launched its freestanding Writing Program in 2004, the Center and Writing Program co-located to Baker-Berry. In that moment the Center became the Student Center for Research, Writing, and Information Technology (RWIT). Collaboratively overseen by the Writing Program, the Library, and Academic Computing, RWIT has become a central support service that assists students with a variety of papers and projects at all stages of the composing process. Now located in the Library’s collaborative learning space, RWIT offers assistance to undergraduate and graduate students through its peer tutoring program in the Center, its Writing Assistance Program (RWIT-in-the-classroom), a senior honors thesis tutoring program, internships available to Masters in Comparative Literature students, and tutors and writing assistants for students writing papers in French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. The Center serves more than one-quarter of the undergraduate population and a substantial number of graduate students.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Institute for Writing and Rhetoric Philosophy & Aims About Writing at Dartmouth Speech at Dartmouth Our Stories The Story of Writing Instruction at Dartmouth The Story of Speech at Dartmouth The Story of Writing Support at Dartmouth Curriculum Overview Writing Courses Writing 2-3 WRIT 5 First-Year Seminars Humanities 1-2 Speech Courses Speech 20 Speech 25 Speech 26 Speech 27 Speech 30 Speech 31 Speech 33 Speech 34 Speech 36 Speech 37 Speech 40 Placement and Enrollment Policies First-Year Writing & First-Year Seminar Requirements Differences Among First-Year Writing Courses FAQ Directed Self-Placement Process for Writing Registration for Writing 5 or Writing 2-3 Registration for First Year Seminars FAQ First-year Writing Registration First-year Writing Choices Prizes Writing Prize Winners Speech Contest Winners Speech Contest Call for Entries Learning Overview Writing Center Make an Appointment Materials Sources and Citations at Dartmouth Teaching Overview Guidelines Teaching Writing in the First Year Expectations for Writing 2-3 Expectations for Writing 5 Teaching the First-Year Seminar First-Year Writing: Pedagogies, Methods, & Design Active Learning in the First-Year Writing Classroom Syllabus and Assignment Design Teaching Writing as Process Integrating Reading and Writing Diagnosing and Responding to Student Writing Conducting Writing Workshops Collaborative Learning/Learning with Peers Teaching Argument Teaching Research Addressing Grammar Useful links Support The Writing Assistant Program Research Past Research Activities Research Overview Multilingual Overview Support for Undergraduate Students Support for Graduate Students Faculty Support News & People People News Employment Upcoming Events Past Events My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
