It does this through widening the scope of the Alliance for Historical Dialogue and Accountability (AHDA), a program of the ISHR to the region. AHDA brings together academics, representatives of civil society organization, journalists, educators and artists as well as policy makers who all pursue historical dialogue in conflict, post-conflict and post-dictatorial societies. They address the political ramifications of the historical legacy of conflicts, as well as the role and impact of the memory of past violence on contemporary politics, society and culture. Columbia Global Centers | Istanbul has been working with Professor Elazar Barkan, Director of the Institute for the Study of Human Rights, and the Alliance for Historical Dialogue and Accountability as well as the Truth, Justice and Memory Studies Center (Hafiza Merkezi), a prominent human rights organization in Turkey, to extend the understanding and practice of historical dialogue in the region.
