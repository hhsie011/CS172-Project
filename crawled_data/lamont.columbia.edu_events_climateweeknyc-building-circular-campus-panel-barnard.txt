Measuring and reporting Scope 3 emissions is notoriously difficult, but they represent as much as 50-60% of Barnard’s total footprint, and the behaviors associated with Scope 3 touch every aspect of the daily lives of our entire community. Join us as we discuss Barnard’s innovative and aggressive approach:panelists will discuss strategies for tracking, measuring, and reducing Scope 3 emissions, including Barnard’s Circular Campus framework, designed to reduce waste, emissions, and costs while supporting student access and affordability. Panelists will situate this approach in the context of Barnard’s overall pathway to net zero. A key topic of this discussion will be how Barnard’s emphasis on circular and regenerative principles aligns with and supports our commitment to social and environmental justice. This event will be held virtually, on zoom. A link will be sent to attendees prior to the start of the panel.
