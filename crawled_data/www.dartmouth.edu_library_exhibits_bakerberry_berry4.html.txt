Dining, classes, religious events, athletic activities, to say nothing of social gatherings, personal meetings, or curfews all required public time. This exhibit explores how the College has kept and communicated this Green Time, via sundials, pocket watches, conch shell trumpets and tower clocks, bells and electrical regulation. And it suggests that Green Time did not always reign supreme, that other times might also intervene … from time to time This exhibit was curated by Ryan Yong ’24 and Rich Kremer, Emeritus Professor of History.
