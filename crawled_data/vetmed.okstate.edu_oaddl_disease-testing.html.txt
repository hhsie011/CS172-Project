The disease is most common in cattle and sheep, but can be seen in dogs, horses, pigs and other animals including humans. Outbreaks in the U.S. have been reported during drought conditions and also following large rainfalls and flooding conditions. The most recent diagnosis of anthrax in cattle and sheep at OADDL was 1996-1997. In many outbreaks, infected animals are simply found dead. Classic signs include rapid bloat, lack of rigor mortis and thick, tarry blood exuding from body orifices. Anthrax is a hemorrhagic disease. Hemorrhagic petechiae are usually seen on tissues such as the sclera, vulva/prepuce, subcutis and mesentery. Important tips to remember: Precautions should be taken when collecting, handling and shipping blood samples from animals suspected of dying from anthrax. Postmortem blood is the preferred sample for anthrax testing at OADDL. Entire carcasses should not be submitted due to the health risk it poses to the public and laboratory staff. A necropsy should NOT be performed. Do not open or transport carcasses suspected of having anthrax. Obtain a postmortem blood sample preferably from the jugular vein. Laboratory diagnosis by culture will require a minimum of 24 hours from the receipt of the sample. Triple bag blood specimens prior to delivery or shipment to the laboratory. Dispose of the carcass in an appropriate manner. Carcass disposal criteria are available on the Oklahoma Department of Ag, Food and Forestry website. The Oklahoma State Veterinarian, Dr. Rod Hall, can provide additional information regarding disposal of animals dying from anthrax. Further information on Anthrax is available below: AVMA - Anthrax (Zoonosis Update) USDA - Epizootiology and Ecology of Anthrax Trichomoniasis PCR OADDL offers individual or pooled Tritrichomonas foetus PCR. Pooling can be performed with up to five (5) InPouch™ TF or PBS Tube samples. Pooling provides an effective method of screening bulls at reduced costs. Individual PCR charges are $25. Pooled PCR charges are $50/pool. If a pool is positive, specimens will be tested individually at $25 each. IMPORTANT NOTE: Cost savings is negated if a pool test positive. In this instance, you will have the price of the original pool ($50 for a pool of up to 5) plus the price of the individual tests ($25 x 5 = $125). Therefore, a positive pool of five animals would cost $175 instead of $125 to test the samples individually. Be strategic when testing and understand the risks. Pooling is extremely cost effective for large numbers, particularly young (virgin) bulls, older bulls from historically Trich-free herds (Trich-free for 12 months), or bulls that have routinely tested negative. If in doubt, do individual testing. Additional information: Use the Trichomoniasis PCR Submittal Form Samples must be collected and submitted individually. All pooling will be done at OADDL. Trichomoniasis PCR testing is performed each business day. InPouch™ samples should be shipped at room temperature by overnight courier. Upon receipt at OADDL, InPouch™ samples will be incubated at 37°C for two overnights prior to testing. InPouch™ samples may be incubated at your facility at 37°C for two overnights, shipped overnight and tested upon receipt. Please verify Trich pouches are not expired. Expired pouches cannot be tested. PBS Tube samples must be purchased from OADDL and should be refrigerated after sample collection and shipped by overnight courier. PBS Tube samples should not be incubated. Refrigeration is recommended after sample collection until shipment. Samples must be received at OADDL within 5 days of collection. When submitting large numbers of samples, please notify the lab prior to collection. Pooled samples or samples submitted in PBS tubes may not be accepted by some states, export countries or sale companies. Verify requirements prior to test submission. Pooling will not be allowed from multiple owners, thus not accepted at livestock markets.
