In response, education systems and schools need to identify and employ the very best tools and practices that could help secure the results they seek. Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai invites you to a workshop with Madhabi Chatterji, Professor of Measurement, Evaluation, and Education at Teachers College, Columbia University, which will introduce new ideas on evidence-based practices in education. The workshop will illustrate how organizations, which are able to make evidence-based education and ongoing evaluations a part of their work culture and value-structure, will continually learn and grow, while generating higher quality outcomes for their students and society at large. About the Speaker Dr. Madhabi Chatterji is Professor of Measurement, Evaluation, and Education at Columbia University’s Teachers College, and the founding Director of the Assessment and Evaluation Research Initiative. An award-winning and internationally recognized methodologist and educationist, her research and teaching interests extend across fields which include education, health and psychology.
