FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE April 29, 2022 Credit Union of America (CUA) was recognized today as a 2022 Champion for Wichita State’s College of Applied Studies (CAS), honoring their ongoing engagement and financial support of the future educators of Kansas. They’ve pledged an additional $250,000 to the college to continue funding the Corbin Connect program, ongoing technology needs, scholarships and programming for CAS students. “The College of Applied Studies is thrilled to have Credit Union of America’s continued support through the extension of this partnership,” said Clay Stoldt, interim dean of CAS. “CUA has already shown a deep commitment to serving educators through Corbin Connect and this gift will allow the College of Applied Studies to build on that strong foundation while expanding our reach to better serve students, faculty and community partners.” The College Champion Award is presented each spring to an individual or group who has been particularly impactful to the college. CUA’s partnership reaches beyond monetary donations, and employees regularly participate in volunteer and mentorship opportunities with CAS. “Credit Union of America is honored and humbled to receive the CAS College Champion Award,” said Frank Shoffner, CUA president and CEO. “Our daily mission is to make a difference in our members’ lives and in our communities. We’re excited to see that mission extend to future educators through our support of WSU.” Their gift of $250,000 will be made over five years, providing funding for room upgrades, equipment and supplies, along with scholarships for five students each year. Funds will also go to outreach, training and support for the Teacher Apprentice Program (TAP). The College of Applied Studies offers degree paths in education, leadership, human performance studies and sport management. It combines nationally accredited programs, exclusive scholarships and applied learning opportunities to equip students with the experience they need to be successful in their chosen fields. Corbin Connect is a space within the Corbin Education Building dedicated to promoting collaboration, innovation and education for WSU and the surrounding community. CUA’s support of the space equips it to engage stakeholders in a variety of impactful ways that transcend traditional university activities. Learn more about the College of Applied Studies.
