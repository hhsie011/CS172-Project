The expertise of faculty in NBB ranges from neuroscience to the evolution of behavior. A major learning goal of our program is to appreciate knowledge from multiple levels of analysis, while specializing in one or more of these areas (mechanistic, developmental, adaptive and evolutionary). We offer a broad exposure and core curricular basis that will serve as the foundation for more specialized coursework, and ultimately, for independent research in preparation for a career as a professional biologist with a range of employment options. While each student’s course of study is tailored to his or her needs and background, students across the program will share many learning goals on the road to establishing themselves as professional biologists, including: independent learning and mastery of the appropriate literature in the student’s subfield; integration of the current state of knowledge to formulate a cutting edge research question; acquisition of data collection skills; acquisition of appropriate analysis skills to derive conclusions for appropriately designed investigations; effective communication abilities using written, spoken and presentation skills. Proficiencies A candidate for a Ph.D. in Neurobiology and Behavior is expected to demonstrate mastery of knowledge in the field of NBB, and to contribute significant, original research to our understanding of behavior within their sub-discipline. In so doing, the candidate shall demonstrate the ability to critically evaluate the state of their field by analyzing available scientific literature synthesize current knowledge and identify novel research questions in their chosen field master appropriate research techniques and collect original data analyze results using appropriate technological and statistical methods place and interpret results into a scholarly context and identify their biological importance master communication skills including the publication of scientific papers, the presentation of scientific talks and the delivery of pedagogically sound lectures stay abreast of the current state of their chosen field support and disseminate knowledge through collaboration, teaching and mentoring uphold standards for scientific rigor and ethical behavior.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
