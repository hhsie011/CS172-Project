All of these tutoring programs help students with any stage of learning (from brainstorming to concept mastery) and aid students who need help to pass a class as well as students who simply want to maximize performance and learning. To that end, tutors are expected to help students understand material and learn how to solve problems; tutors are not simply homework helpers. The tutoring offered through the AARC follows this Stanford tutoring model and student-athletes may avail themselves of 2 hours of tutoring per class per week for any reason.
