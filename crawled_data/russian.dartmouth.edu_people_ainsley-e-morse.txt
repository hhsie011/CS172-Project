Morse |Assistant Professor Exploring the many peculiar, beautiful, and dreadful corners of Russia / the former Soviet Union and its languages, literatures and arts, and sharing my discoveries with students, friends and family, has been my main occupation for many years now. I am excited to bring some of these stories to Dartmouth and to keep exploring with students here. I studied Russian and Serbo-Croatian/BCS literature at Harvard University (PhD 2016) and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill (MA 2008), as well as (and perhaps more significantly) less formally over years of staying in Russia and Serbia/Croatia and learning from people there. As a teacher, I try to recreate this learning experience by making an immersive learning environment even in the Dartmouth classroom, and encouraging students to seek out the topic that will really grab and inspire them to make independent discoveries. I also teach a fair amount of historical and political context--without it, Russian literature (and film, and culture overall) can seem even more bizarre than intended. And, as a lover of poetry, I teach slow close reading--the depths a single line can yield are always astonishing. + View more View Curriculum Vitae Contact Ainsley.E.Morse@Dartmouth.edu 211 Reed, Russian Department HB 6085 Education B.A. University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill M.A. University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill Ph.D Harvard University Areas of Expertise Russian literature, Soviet literature, Yugoslav and post-Yugoslav literatures, poetry, translation Selected Publications ·Permanent Evolution: The Collected Theoretical Works of Yuri Tynianov(ed. and trans.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Russian Undergraduate Majors and Minors Majors: Russian Language and Area Studies Minors Courses Course Descriptions Courses by Term Placement Test Awards & Prizes The Solzhenitsyn Prize in Russian The Pray Modern Language Prize in Russian The Richard Sheldon Prize The Honors Program Foreign Study Resources & Opportunities Overview Student Assistant Teacher Opportunities Martin T.
