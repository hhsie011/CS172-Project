From their use as medical implants and markers, to sensing and drug delivery applications, to studies of bio-inspired and bio-enabled synthesis and formation of new materials for a variety of applications, the field of biomaterials is a rich area of research being actively pursued by a number of our faculty. It is the basis of one of the start-up companies led by an MSE faculty, and also the central theme of the BIONIC Air Force Center of Excellence. The faculty listed below, have identified Biomolecular-Solids and Biomaterials as one of their primary research areas based on material form.
