The fee helps to cover the cost of processing your application and is non-refundable. The application fee will not be waived. Like many graduate programs, we base our admissions decisions primarily on the information requested above. We have no minimum test scores. We recognize that you may have talents and experience that do not shine through the forms and test scores. Use the Application Essay section of the online application to give additional information. Do you have a specific reason for coming to Dartmouth? Specific goals for your study? Significant work experience? Why do you want to do advanced training in computer science? Include any publications you have authored. In the Computer Science Supplement section of the online application, attach examples of your work. This is also the place where you can attach a resume. At the discretion of the admissions committee, we award stipends as well as tuition grants without stipend. The stipend awards cover tuition waiver and a payment for living expenses for nine months of each year for five years, as long as satisfactory progress is made toward the Ph.D. The stipend for 2021-2022 is $2,630 per month, and it generally increases every year. Health insurance cost for the academic year is covered by the college for full-time students. Graduate students who receive support contribute to the program by teaching or grading undergraduate courses, assisting with advanced courses, and participating in research projects. Additional stipend is provided for the summer months if the student performs research or teaching assistance during that period. There is no separate application for financial aid. Every applicant is considered for financial aid, unless you say that you do not need financial support. If you do not need support, please indicate this on the application form, and tell us how you expect to be supported.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Computer Science Undergraduate Overview What You Will Learn Advice & Contact Declaring your CS Major/Minor Programs The Major Modified Majors The Minors Honors Program AIT-Budapest for Dartmouth Students Courses Upcoming Class Schedule Prizes Previous Winners Considering Graduate School?
