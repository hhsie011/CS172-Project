The chapter gathers for numerous events throughout the year, including happy hours, networking lunches, food tours, game watches, and service initiatives. While events in Miami typically range in location, from Brickell to Wynwood, they will occasionally partner with other chapters in South Florida for events, such as a professional sports outing.

I think the top three are: during my junior year the hockey team went all the way to win the National Championship, studying in Florence, and, of course, meeting and falling in love with my husband! Why did you get involved in your local chapter?: Boston College played such a significant role in both my personal and professional life. To be able to give back somehow and help others who are a part of the BC family is important to me. What are your local favorites in your city?: Favorite restaurants include YIP at 1800Lucky for dumplings, Blue Ribbon Sushi in Miami Beach, Ricky Thai in North Miami, and Casa Tua Cucina for pizza. One of my favorite places in Miami is the Frost Science Museum. It has great rotating exhibits and an extraordinary aquarium. Dan Lever '02 Lives in: Brickell Key - Miami, Florida Major: Finance Occupation: Attorney Favorite BC Memory: Meeting my wife, obviously. Why Did you get involved in your local chapter?: I wanted to create a network of BC’ers that could support each other. Fun Fact: I can juggle. What are your local favorites in your city?: The food scene in Miami has really exploded over the last seven years.
