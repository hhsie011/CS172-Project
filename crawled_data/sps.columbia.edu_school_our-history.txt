Originally named the Division of Special Programs, professional education at Columbia began with several non-degree programs, one overseas program, the Summer Sessions, Summer High School Programs, the American Language Program, and a few inter-institutional arrangements. Over the next five years, it expanded steadily, launching a series of programs aimed at postgraduate students who needed to prepare for graduate school or career advancement and at undergraduates who wanted to study overseas for a semester, year, or over the summer. In 2002, the Board of Trustees of Columbia granted final approval for the creation of the School of Continuing Education, the first new school at Columbia in 50 years. With this status, the school gained the authority to confer the Master of Science degree. To reflect a targeted focus on professional degree offerings, market-specific academic programming, and cross-disciplinary scholarly research, the Board approved changing the school’s name in 2015 to the School of Professional Studies. Purposeful in its mission, the School of Professional Studies provides a rigorous education informed by rapidly evolving global market requirements, which supports the academic and professional aspirations of its student community. 100+ Years of History 50+ Programs and Counting 2 New Programs in 2020 Timeline Summer 1900 - present Columbia Summer 1911 - present American Language Program 1986 - present Lifelong Learners Auditing Program 1987 - present Summer Programs for High School Students: New York City 1996 - present Certification of Professional Achievement in Business 1998 - present Certificate in Classics 1999 - present Certificate in Psychology 2002 - Fall 2004 Certification of Professional Achievement in Fundraising Management (subsumed by the Fundraising Management master's program) 2002 - present Summer Programs for High School Students: Barcelona Summer 2002 - present Strategic Communication: International Perspectives Fall 2002 - present Executive Master of Science in Strategic Communication 2003 - present Certificate in Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology Certificate in Quantitative Studies for Finance Fall 2003 - present Certificate in Biotechnology Fall 2004 - Fall 2016 Master of Science in Fundraising Management Fall 2004 - present Executive Master of Science in Technology Management 2005 - 2013 Master of Science in Landscape Design Fall 2006 - present Master of Science in Actuarial Science Master of Science in Information and Knowledge Strategy Master of Science in Construction Administration Master of Science in Sports Management Fall 2008 - present Master of Science in Negotiation and Conflict Resolution 2009 - present Summer Programs For High School Students: Jordan Fall 2009 - present Master of Science in Strategic Communication Master of Science in Narrative Medicine Summer 2010 - present Certification of Professional Achievement in Critical Issues in International Relations United Nations Studies Fall 2010 - present Master of Science in Bioethics Master of Science in Sustainability Management 2011 - present Certification of Professional Achievement in Advanced Business Summer 2011 - present Certification of Professional Achievement in Human Rights Fall 2012 - present Certification of Professional Achievement in Sustainability Analytics 2013 - present Graduate Foundations Program Spring 2013 - present Certification of Professional Achievement in Sustainable Water Management Business Edge Fall 2013 - present Certification of Professional Achievement in Actuarial Science Certification of Professional Achievement in Bioethics Summer 2014 - present Business Practice Business Plus Fall 2015 - 2017 Master of Science in Sports Management and Master in Global Sports Law Companion Degree Program Fall 2015 - present Certification of Professional Achievement in Sustainable Finance Talks@Columbia Spring 2016 - present Accelerated Program in Sustainable Development and Sustainability Management Master of Science in Enterprise Risk Management Certification of Professional Achievement in Enterprise Risk Management Fall 2016 - present Master of Science in Applied Analytics Master of Science in Nonprofit Management Summer 2017 - present College Edge Fall 2017 - present Master of Science in Technology Management Certification of Professional Achievement in Narrative Medicine Spring 2018 - present Master of Science in Sustainability Science Fall 2018 - present Master of Science in Human Capital Management Starting Spring 2020 Master of Professional Studies in Insurance Management Starting Fall 2020 Master of Professional Studies in Wealth Management Footer Social Links LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Instagram Columbia University School of Professional Studies Secondary navigation Faculty Staff Students Alumni Blog News Events The School Academics Impact Admissions Footer menu Careers at SPS Contact Us Support SPS Store 203 Lewisohn Hall 2970 Broadway, MC 4119 New York, NY, 10027 © Copyright 2019 Columbia University School of Professional Studies.
