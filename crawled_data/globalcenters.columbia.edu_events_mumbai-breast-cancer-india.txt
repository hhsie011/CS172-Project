7:00 PM Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai, 12-13, Maker Chambers VI, First floor, Jamnalal Bajaj Road, Nariman Point, Mumbai 400 021 Globally, the burden of breast cancer (BC) has increased annually at a rate of 3.1%, and a third of all global BC occurs in women under age 50 years. The increase in BC incidence is observed in every continent around the world; given the increases are seen in countries with very different reproductive patterns, other factors, besides changes in reproductive trends, must be driving these shifts. In India, rates of BC are surpassing cervical cancer. Of particular concern, India has the highest rate of the most aggressive breast cancer referred to as Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) in the world. TNBC lacks targeted therapy and has a higher fatality rate than other BC subtypes. Given these alarming facts, we need focused studies of environmental exposures that have been changing over time, particularly in young women under 50. To this end, Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai is organizing a symposium to convene a transdisciplinary network of stakeholders who are vested in examining environmental exposures and BC risk, and furthering breast cancer risk reduction efforts, featuring Yusuf Hamied Fellows Dr. Mary Beth Terry and Dr. Jasmine McDonald from the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health. This symposium is by invitation only.
