Its past is traced to French explorers and missionaries in the 17th century. Its present is characterized by the rigorous pursuit of truth in every field as a preeminent Catholic research institution. Notre Dame at its founding bears the marks of Notre Dame today. For 175 years, our Catholic character has informed all we do, and all we are. When Rev. Edward Sorin, C.S.C. came to the Indiana frontier in November 1842, all that stood on the land was a dilapidated log chapel. Yet Fr. Sorin saw here a great university. His boldness of vision can be found on campus 175 years later. See how Notre Dame's founding and early life has shaped its present and future endeavors.View the Timeline Featured Moments Notre Dame grotto Wireless radio Fr.
