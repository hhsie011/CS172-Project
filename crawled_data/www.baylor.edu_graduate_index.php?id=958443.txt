Tuition Remission & Stipends Nearly all incoming Ph.D. students receive full tuition remission, a multi-year research or teaching assistantship, and an 80% subsidy for student health insurance. Stipend levels are highly competitive, and with Waco’s low cost of living, roughly two-thirds of Ph.D. graduates accrue no student loan debt during their doctoral program. Masters programs offer varying levels of support, ranging from a partial tuition waiver to full tuition remission with a stipend. Please contact your program of interest for details. Professional programs typically do not provide funding support. Health & Wellness Health Insurance Beginning July 2020, all domestic graduate students under the auspices of the Baylor Graduate School (including DPT and Online students) taking 3 credit hours or more or at least 1 hour of a full-time equivalency course must demonstrate proof of active insurance. Students will demonstrate their proof of insurance or enroll in Baylor's student insurance through the AHP (Academic HealthPlans) portal each semester during the open enrollment period. Most students who are fully-funded will be eligible to receive an 80% insurance subsidy for the individual student premium. Learn more Free Access to Basic Health Care We are very pleased to share the news of BU’s partnership with Telehealth Services. This portal is available to all students, from any location, 24/7/365. Telehealth provides quick, accessible, and free services for basic physical health, mental health, and nutritional concerns. Students can meet online or set up in-person appointments for counseling, urgent care, therapy, psychiatry and nutrition counseling services at no cost. Learn more Childbirth/Adoption Accommodations In recognition of the challenges of balancing the demands of graduate study and parenting a new child, this policy aims to improve the environment for student-parents by addressing the conflicts and issues that may arise as the two goals of advanced education and parenthood intersect. Learn more Short-Term Leave Accommodation Graduate students suffering from a serious medical condition may apply for short-term medical leave from their academic and assistantship responsibilities. Learn more Baylor Funding Opportunities In addition to the benefits above, Baylor has a number of funding opportunities aimed at supporting the research and professional development of graduate students.
