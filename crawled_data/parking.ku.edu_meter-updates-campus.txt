All Yellow lots are enabled to use ParkMobile or Passport to pay per hour (parkingapp.com). No smartphone to pay in the Yellow lots? ParkMobile has an option where you can call and pay by dialing 877-727-5973. We still have meters available in Green Hall Circle Drive (20 min limit), JRP Circle Drive (20 minute limit), Lot 1 behind Carruth (1 or 2 hour limit), Lot 70 (40 minute limit), Lot 210 (10 hour limit) and Lot 111 (40 minute limit).
