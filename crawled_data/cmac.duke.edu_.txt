Academics Graduate Programs Our Doctoral Program – designed to be small, experimental and interdisciplinary – focuses on the intersection of media arts and humanities, sciences, and technology, both in theory and in practice. Our Master’s Program explore research and presentation strategies enabled by information sciences, new approaches to computational processes, and new forms of interpreting quantitative and qualitative data. We offer a Digital Art History track and a Computation Media track for the MA. Offered through the Information Science + Studies (ISS) Program, a graduate certificate is also available. Undergraduate Programs An interdepartmental major (IDM) and minor in Computational Media was created for students who want to combine deep theoretical and critical engagement with art, computation, and culture with substantive engagement with core computer science concepts and principles, undertaken alongside hands-on experience with computational media practice. The IDM is sponsored by the departments of Art, Art History & Visual Studies and Computer Science. An undergraduate certificate is also offered through the Information Science + Studies (ISS) Program.
