The view of the night sky from the observatory is spectacular -- one easily sees more than four times as many stars as from Hanover. A brief overview of the 2023 astronomy FSP is provided by faculty director Professor Brian Chaboyer in this video. The Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (nearby galaxies) are larger than the full moon and easily visible to the unaided eye. The South African Astronomical Observatory in Sutherland, South Africa. PreviousNext Through first hand observations and intensive studies, students will learn about stars in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds. During the first five weeks of the program students will be based in Cape Town, learning about research methods, astrophysics and observational astronomy through classroom instruction and practical projects. This will include learning how to operate telescopes, and running public observing sessions. Approximately one week of the program will be spent at the national observatory in Sutherland (four hours north of Cape Town), a remote location which is home to over 20 professional telescopes, including the largest telescope in the southern hemisphere, SALT. After collecting data for a week, students will return to Cape Town, where they will analyze their data and present the results of their independent research. During this time, students will assist staff at the national observatory in their public outreach efforts by visiting local schools, introducing young learners to the wonders of the night sky and the science of astronomy. Dartmouth faculty will teach the regular courses and supervise the independent projects, assisted by a graduate student TAs. Curriculum Astronomy 61: Observational Techniques in Astronomy Physics 31.02: Research Methods in Astronomy and Physics Astronomy 81: Special Topics in Astronomy Living Accommodations In Cape Town, students will be housed in off-campus apartments, near the University of Cape Town and the headquarters of the South African Astronomical Observatory. Apartments are equipped with kitchens, and students will be responsible for their own meals. While at the observatory, students will be living on site in dorm rooms and meals will be provided. Prerequisites An introductory physics course (Physics 3, 13 or 15), and an introductory astronomy course (Astronomy 2, 3 or 15).

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Physics and Astronomy Undergraduate Overview Information for New Students Physics Major Astronomy Major Engineering Physics Major Undergraduate Awards Honors Recent Senior Theses Undergraduate Requirements Physics and Astronomy Course Offerings Physics Society Student Research Opportunities Careers in Physics and Astronomy Astronomy and Your Career Undergraduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Graduate Overview Graduate Awards Apply Financial Aid Degree Requirements Courses Recent PhD Graduates Graduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Foreign Study Overview Astronomy FSP in South Africa Research Overview All Projects Astrophysics Current Projects Particles, Fields, Gravitation, and Cosmology Current Projects Gravitational Quantum Physics Quantum and Condensed Matter Current Projects Plasma and Space Physics Current Projects Resources Overview Weather Archive News & Events News & Events Colloquia Physics and Astronomy Colloquia Colloquium Archives (before 2017) Symposiums Symposium on Charles Young's 1869 Discovery of Coronium Jay Lawrence Symposium Archive Pressure of Light Symposium Public Lecture Archives Public Observing People Faculty & Staff Students Alumni Advisory Board Membership Directory Committee Assignments Department Chair Diversity Statement Graduate Advisor Undergraduate Advisor My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
