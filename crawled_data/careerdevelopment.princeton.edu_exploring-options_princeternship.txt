Here's your chance. Since 2008, the Princeternship program has been offering students an inside look at careers by sending them out into the field to investigate career paths and foster personal connections with alumni and employers. Offered by alumni, Princeternships are a career exploration opportunity providing a combination job shadowing, skill development and relationship-building in one-on-one or small-group settings. What to Expect Princeternships can be either virtual or in-person, ranging from one- to five-day shadowing experiences to one- to four-week projects. Princeternships provide undergraduate students an opportunity to get to know the career path of their alum host, learn about possible fields and potentially get tangible experience in environments focused on students' learning and growth. Opportunities span a range of geographic regions and fields. 2021-22 Princeternship Dates Applications open: Oct. 4, 2021 Application deadline: Oct. 20, 2021 at 11:59 p.m. Decisions: All students will receive emails informing them of decisions.

"Princeternships are an amazing opportunity to grow and learn as a student. Lectures and precepts can only go so far in terms of introducing us to the real world, and we must take these unique opportunities to supplement our classroom education." - Marina Beshai '22 Back to Top Footer Center for Career Development 36 University Place, Suite 200 Princeton, NJ 08544 General: careerdevelopment@princeton.edu Recruiting: recruit@princeton.edu (609) 258-3325 Privacy Notice Disclaimer Footer menu Make an appointment Handshake Facebook Twitter YouTube Instagram Accessibility © 2022 The Trustees of Princeton University
