With all expansion plans on hold, Barbour focused instead on the task of connecting with Brown’s far-flung alumni and the University's public relations in general. Just days before his death in 1937, he said, “Holding Brown steady in a very critical time was, I feel, the greatest accomplishment of my administration.” Brown University Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA Phone: 401-863-1000 Maps & Directions / Contact Us © Brown University X
