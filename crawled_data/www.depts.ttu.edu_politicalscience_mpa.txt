The Master of Public Administration (MPA), fully accredited by the NASPAA (The Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs, and Administration), provides professional knowledge and skills-based competence for working public administrators or students seeking a career as a manager or policy analyst in public or nonprofit agencies. Recipients of our degree enter the job market equipped with general public management skills and a specialization in a particular public sector or policy areas such as non-profit management, public management, health care administration, and environmental policy and administration. The MPA is conferred and administered by the Department of Political Science in conjunction with the Center for Public Service. Our degree is offered in the following locations: Lubbock (Main Campus), Waco, Sherman (Austin College), and Dallas/Fort Worth (Collin College). We also have an online degree program. Currently, we have a few courses that are asynchronous, but most courses are synchronous. The synchronous courses meet online at a scheduled time of 6:00-8:50 pm and join the face-to-face course held in Lubbock, TX. At Texas Tech we offer a quality education with a high degree of interaction among faculty and students. We are committed to challenging students in the classroom and providing a "cutting-edge" education. Students will have the opportunity to participate in an internship in the surrounding community and gain valuable hands-on experience with a public service organization.
