Classes » Scheduling Officer Information Short Courses Standard Meeting Times Definitions for Course Components Scheduling Forms & Documents Auditoriums The Office of the University Registrar manages centrally scheduled classrooms and auditoriums. Due to the limited number of auditoriums, there are specific procedures for making a request to use an auditorium with a capacity of 100 or more. Auditorium assignments are based on previous use during the last like term and approved utilization guidelines. Approved utilization for auditoriums is 80% or higher. There are exceptions to this rule when enrollment for a class does not meet the 80% minimum but is too large for the next smaller capacity auditorium. Use the Enrollment Needed to Keep column in the list of centrally scheduled auditoriums to compare the the actual number enrolled on the appropriate Auditorium Utilization Report. Please email scheduling@ku.edu if you have any questions or concerns. Do I need to submit a request? No, if you had a class in an auditorium that met or exceeded the Enrollment Needed to Keep and the time and days of the course are staying the same. Yes, if you meet one of the following criteria: This is a new class that needs an auditorium You had a class, but it did not meet the Enrollment Needed to Keep requirement You had a class, but the time and/or day is changing. Fill out the Advanced Auditorium Request form using the prior term’s Auditorium Utilization Report or if new, as a basis for your request. This report reflects room usage for the appropriate semester and enrollment totals as of the first day of classes or the census date (20th day), whichever is larger. If you need an auditorium for a departmental seminar (BIOL 701), please include this information on your Advanced Auditorium Request form. Standard Meeting Information If the class follows our standard meeting patterns and if the number enrolled is equal to or larger than the Enrollment Needed to Keep, the class will retain the auditorium assignment and you do not need to include the class when submitting the Auditorium request form. If the class had a nonstandard meeting pattern, it will not retain its auditorium even if it met the Enrollment Needed to Keep number. Please do not submit requests for non-standard meeting patterns for advanced placement. Non-standard meeting patterns will be reviewed during the update period and if approved, will be placed during room optimization.
