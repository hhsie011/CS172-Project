You may find them along walkways, inside building Celebrated Entrances, and in and around parking garages. Pushing the call button activates a direct phone line within UTPD 911 dispatch that automatically pinpoints the caller’s location. An officer will immediately respond. Please report any issues with call boxes to the ITS Service Desk at 512-475-9400 or help@utexas.edu. Pushing a call button when there is no emergency is the same as making a false report to law enforcement — a Class B misdemeanor punishable by up to 180 days in jail and a fine of $2,000.
