Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery Enslaved: Peoples of the Historical Slave Trade Enslaved: Peoples of the Historical Slave Trade is an open-source database of historical information and stories highlighting the lives of the enslaved dating from the 15th century to the late 1800s and spanning Western Europe, Africa, and North and South America. Peoples of the Historical Slave Trade About the project Understanding and dismantling anti-Black racism is one of the most urgent and persistent issues of our time. Confronting Anti-Black Racism curates Harvard research and resources on the history of racism in the United States and its impact on Black communities. The project introduces and explores a continuous knowledge loop of scholarship, library resources, and real-world experiences of Black Americans. It enables researchers to examine the past and understand the present, giving us the tools to build a better future. Confronting Anti-Black Racism is developed by Harvard Library.
