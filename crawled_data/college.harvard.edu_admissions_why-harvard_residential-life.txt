You will live in a community of students hailing from all fifty states and more than eighty countries, whose diverse backgrounds, life experiences, and perspectives enrich and enliven our campus. First-Year Dormitories Your first year will be spent in picturesque Harvard Yard, the historic heart of the University. Through activities specially designed for first-year students, such as Opening Days, a Harvard-Yale tailgate, and more, you will get to know your classmates and the College. The Dean of Students Office creates careful, intentional matches between first-year students. Typically, students live in suites, which include a common room and two to four bedrooms. All first-year students dine in Annenberg Hall, one of Harvard’s most beautiful interior spaces located in the legendary Memorial Hall. Upper-Level Houses One of the most exciting moments of your first year is Housing Day, when you'll learn which of Harvard's historic Houses you've been assigned to live in for the remainder of your undergraduate experience. Made up of 350 to 500 students, each House serves as your homebase throughout your sophomore, junior, and senior years. Each House is led by a Faculty Dean—a faculty member who lives in the House with their family. As you share in House meals, extracurriculars, intramural sports, and other activities, you'll learn from the perspectives and experiences of your housemates and develop friendships and connections that endure long after graduation.
