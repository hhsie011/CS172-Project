Established in 1997 with a generous grant from Rita and Gustave Hauser, the Institute—which merged with the Center for Public Leadership in 2013—links academics with practitioners across sectors, helping to shape policy that enhances the sector and its role in society. Through work at the Initiative for Responsible Investment, the Social Innovation + Change Initiative, and our Trotter Collaborative for Social Justice, our affiliated faculty are exploring critical questions about the role non-profits, civil society institutions, and organizing can play to challenge the status quo and promote innovation that shapes a more just and sustainable society.
