The basic requirement for admission as a graduate student is the bachelor's degree received from an institution of acceptable standing. Ordinarily, the applicant will have majored in the field in which graduate study is intended, but in certain programs preparation in a related field of engineering or science is acceptable. The applicant will be admitted only if the undergraduate record shows promise of productive and effective graduate work. The Master of Science (MS) degree is required for admission into the PhD and EngScD degree programs. A student who holds an appropriate bachelor's degree in engineering may apply for admission to either the MS only or MS leading to PhD program. A student who has not already earned an MS degree and is looking to pursue a doctoral degree should apply for admission to the MS/PhD track program, with the exception of the Computer Science PhD program. All doctoral applicants to the Computer Science Department should apply for admission to the PhD program, regardless of whether they have completed an MS degree or not. Students enrolled in the MS/PhD program are considered doctoral students, and are eligible to receive equivalent funding. More information about the doctoral degree can be found in the bulletin. Consideration for admission will be based not only on the completion of earlier courses of study, but also upon the quality of the record presented and upon such evidence as can be obtained concerning the candidate's personal fitness to pursue professional work. Please review our application options, and requirements, thoroughly. Requirements The following materials must accompany the online application for on-campus graduate programs: Official transcript copies from every post-secondary institution attended Three recommendation letters Official Graduate Record Examination (GRE) General Test Scores* Optional for Spring and Fall 2022 applications School Code: 2111 Personal statement Resumé or Curriculum Vitae Publications (optional) An interview may be requested $85 non-refundable application fee International applicants or applicants whose undergraduate degree was received in a country in which English is not the official and widely spoken language must submit the following additional requirements with the application for admission: Test of English as a Foreign Language iBT (TOEFL) - including TOEFL iBT Home Edition, International English Language Testing System Academic (IELTS), Pearson Test of English (PTE Academic), or Duolingo English Test (DET).

The following programs will not be accepting applications for the Spring 2022 term: Applied Mathematics (MS and Doctoral) Applied Physics (MS and Doctoral) Business Analytics MS Computer Science [email protected] MS Bridge Data Science (Cert. and MS) Electrical Engineering MS Financial Engineering MS Industrial Engineering Doctoral Journalism and Computer Science Dual MS Management Science and Engineering MS Materials Science and Engineering (MS and Doctoral) Mechanical Engineering MS Medical Physics (Cert. and MS) Operations Research Doctoral Multiple Applications It is against school policy to apply to more than one program at the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science per term, including Columbia Video Network (CVN). Doing so may cause applications to be invalidated and application fees paid for additional applications will not be refunded. Do not create a new application account in order to circumvent this policy. If you have questions, please contact the Office of Graduate Student Affairs at [email protected] for clarification. Application Materials Review the information below for more detailed instructions on each application component. Transcripts On your application, you must list all colleges and universities you have attended for at least one term, regardless of the number of credits received, including professional schools and summer study from which you have received academic credit. After listing your institution, you will be prompted to upload a copy of your transcript. The transcript copy you upload onto your online application should be a copy of your official transcript or a student copy of your transcript. We ask that you not upload screenshots of your online student portal. Uploading anything other than a copy of your official transcript, or student copy, may cause a delay in the review of your application. If you are a currently enrolled graduate student at Columbia Engineering applying again to another department or degree level you must upload a copy of your transcript to your online application. This is required even if you are a student at Columbia Engineering already and whether or not it is your first semester and grades are available. Official transcripts do not need to be sent from your institution to Columbia Engineering until after you are admitted and have accepted your offer of admission. Do not send us transcripts prior to this. Letters of Recommendation Columbia Engineering requires three letters of recommendation. Letters of recommendation should be written by faculty members with whom you have studied, who can assess your academic work, intellectual ability, academic potential for graduate work, address your suitability for the program, and your ability to commit to the rigorous curriculum. You may also submit letters of recommendation from current or former supervisors. Personal references are not appropriate. Upon entering your recommendation providers' contact information in your application, your recommendation providers will be contacted to supply the letter of recommendation. Under no circumstance should you write any portion of the evaluation, nor have any involvement in its drafting or submission. Test Scores Score Reports Please upload a copy of the corresponding score report for any test scores you have provided in your application. This is the only score report required at the time of application. Your self-reported scores will be verified during the post-admit verification process. After admission, you should have official scores sent to us directly from your testing agency (ETS code 2111). If we cannot verify your test scores, we will contact you. Please do not contact our office to confirm if your scores were received, as this will create a backlog.
