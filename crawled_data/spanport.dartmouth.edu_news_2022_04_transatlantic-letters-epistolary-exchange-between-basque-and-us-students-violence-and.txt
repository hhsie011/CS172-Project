Transatlantic Letters: An Epistolary Exchange between Basque and US Students on Violence and Community PreviousNext Transatlantic Letters: An Epistolary Exchange between Basque and US Students on Violence and Community Annabel Martín María Pilar Rodríguez (eds.) Digital version available in Spanish and English This book brings together the letters that eight college-age students, three from Dartmouth College (Lucas Joshi, Rachel Kent, and Naren Radhakrishan) and five from the University of Deusto (Pablo Bellido, Paula del Barrio, Zuriñe Iglesias, Unai Murua, and Naiara Nájera) exchanged over email and videoconferencing from March to December 2020. This initiative was made possible thanks to the collaboration between two faculty members and colleagues, Annabel Martín (Dartmouth College) and María Pilar Rodríguez (University of Deusto) when they introduced their students to each other in the context of a seminar being taught at Dartmouth College on the postETA context. The letters focus on the broad theme of political violence and the challenges that both Basque and US society face regarding coexistence and the idea of community. The letters dwell upon the world these young adults are inheriting, on social engagement in their respective communities, and on their personal experiences when facing these challenges. The letters are profound, intimate, and exhibit a deep curiosity for understanding and learning from the different contexts. Topics include racial violence, the victims of political violence, immigration, political activism, the use of violence for political struggle, fear and self- censorship, civil disobedience, the effects of neoliberal capitalism on communities, civil rights, issues of identity, etc. The volume includes an introduction penned by the editors, a short prologue by Bernardo Atxaga, and a letter that Maixabel Lasa writes to this next generation of social activists. The book ends with an intergenerational fifth chapter where Esther Pascual, the mediator of the restorative justice project at the Nanclares de Oca Prison, Luisa Etxenike, writer, Cristina Ortiz, academic (U of Wisconsin- Green Bay), Txema Urkijo, former director of the Basque Government's Office for Victims of Terrorism, and Iñaki García Arrizabalaga, academic (Deusto) and ETA victim, address the challenges these students face regarding the building of community in today's world. Annabel Martín is an Associate Professor of Spanish, Comparative Literature, and Women's Gender, and Sexualities Studies at Dartmouth College (USA) and was the founding director of the Gender Research Institute (GRID) at that institution. María Pilar Rodríguez is an Associate Professor in the Department of Communication at the University of Deusto and director of the Doctorate in Leisure, Culture, and Communication for Human Development. She is the Principal Investigator of the Communication Research Group.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Spanish and Portuguese Undergraduate Overview Frequently Asked Questions Advisors Student Awards and Prizes Programs Hispanic Studies Romance Studies Lusophone Studies Hispanic and Lusophone Studies Honors Thesis Program Thesis Timeline Application Process Thesis Research Funding Past Theses Courses Spanish Portuguese First-Year Seminars (FYS) Placement Information Spanish Portuguese Transfer Credits Alumni Update Foreign Study Overview Programs in Spanish Spanish LSA in Barcelona and Buenos Aires (NEW) Spanish LSA in Santander (NEW) Spanish LSA+ in Barcelona [NEW] Spanish LSA+ in Buenos Aires Spanish FSP in Madrid and Buenos Aires Programs in Portuguese Portuguese LSA+ in São Paulo, Brazil Student Opportunities Overview Apprentice Teacher Information Digital Resources Student Funding AT/Drill Instructor Tryout Dates La Casa Overview Apply Living Guidelines Who We Are Frequently Asked Questions Day of the Dead El Cafecito News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
