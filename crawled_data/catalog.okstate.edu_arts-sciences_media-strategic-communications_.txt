Courses Undergraduate Programs Graduate Programs Faculty At Oklahoma State University, the professional areas of mass communication are grouped in the School of Media and Strategic Communications (SMSC). These areas seek to complement each other with a minimum of duplication. Degrees offered include a Bachelor of Arts or a Bachelor of Science in the following: Multimedia Journalism Sports Media Strategic Communication A modern democratic society cannot live by its ideals if its mass media practitioners are merely competent technicians who worry less about what is reported to the people than how it is reported. Citizens must have accurate information about social, political and economic problems as well as knowledge of actions taken by government agencies and organizations at all levels. From village council to Supreme Court, there can be no exception from the rule that public business is the public's business. To speak to people through different media, whether as a journalist or a strategic communication practitioner, requires knowledge of the people to whom or on whose behalf one wishes to speak and an understanding of the world in which they live. Therefore, the curricula of the School of Media and Strategic Communications are designed to offer more than training in communication techniques. Three-quarters of the SMSC student's time at the University is devoted to a liberal education in the arts and sciences. At the same time, the student gains competence in a professional field through courses in the School of Media and Strategic Communications. On graduation, undergraduate students in the School of Media and Strategic Communications will be able to: Demonstrate an understanding of the relevant constitutional freedoms, legal issues and ethical principles in mass communications, Demonstrate an understanding of the relevance of human diversity in mass communications, Demonstrate an understanding of the history and social role of mass communications, Demonstrate critical, creative and individual thinking, Demonstrate an understanding of the relevant theories and concepts of mass communications, Demonstrate an understanding of the methods and techniques of research and information gathering, Demonstrate appropriate writing, editing and production techniques in mass communications, and Demonstrate an understanding of relevant planning and management methods in mass communications. Accreditation The undergraduate programs of study in the School of Media and Strategic Communications are accredited by the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communication. Admission to the Undergraduate Program A 2.75 graduation retention GPA and at least 24 hours completed required to initially declare major. Undergraduate Proficiency Review Successfully passing the proficiency review is required to enroll in upper-division major requirements. The Proficiency Review includes: 2.75 graduation retention GPA; At least 12 OSU earned hours and a 2.75 graduation retention GPA in those hours; Grade of “C” or better for MC 2003 and MC 2023; and Passing score on the Language Proficiency Exam.

Industry employers require communication professionals to be skilled in writing, content creation, research, strategic planning and critical thinking.

Strategic communication courses focus on a thorough understanding of the social, political and economic systems of society and develop writing and content-creation skills that apply across all media platforms, such as print, television, radio, websites, social media, etc. A degree in strategic communication prepares students to be professional communicators in any environment, such as counseling firms, advertising agencies, corporate communications, nonprofit organizations, or even their own businesses. The ultimate objective of this degree is to prepare students to be the future leaders in their field. Coursework prepares students to write and communicate effectively because good writing skills remain the foundation of professional communication. Coursework also focuses on strategic and critical thinking, which are skills needed for leaders in the field. This degree also grounds students in a thorough knowledge of gathering and analyzing data relevant to their practice and in communication management principles. Students complete their degree with a capstone campaign course, where students integrate and apply knowledge gained in their undergraduate work to a single strategic communication campaign. There are three options to choose from for the Strategic Communications degree: SC: Advertising and Public Relations and SC: Social Media are both offered on the OSU-Stillwater campus while SC: Entertainment Media is offered on the OSU-Tulsa campus.
