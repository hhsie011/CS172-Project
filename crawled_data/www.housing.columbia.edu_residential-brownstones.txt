There is so much room for you to either hang out with your friends or even just to sit and study. Plus, when else in my life will I be able to live in a real New York City Brownstone?” “I loved living in the Brownstones. The kitchen and the living room are huge, much bigger than any suite in East Campus. When the weather is warm, we all sit on the steps of our house and hang out with people from the other Brownstones on the block. Overall, I had a great experience living here.” Additional Photos: Image Carousel with 2 slides A carousel is a rotating set of images.
