The Mindich Program in Engaged Scholarship is focused on integrating civically engaged experiential learning into the academic fabric of Harvard College. Engaged Scholarship consists of curricular and co-curricular components, and includes courses, research, and internship opportunities. With a focus on creating linkages, and working together to create new and strengthen existing opportunities for students and faculty, Engaged Scholarship works in collaboration with faculty, staff, and various programs, offices, and initiatives across Harvard. By creating opportunities for students to engage with communities and social issues through academics, Engaged Scholarship aims to nurture the development of 21st century competencies among students: Habits of mind that can relate education to life and the world Collaboration skills The ability to dialogue across differences, communities, and sectors of civic and community life Creativity, critical and systems thinking The ability to draw on multiple perspectives, forms of information, and knowledge domains to innovate and problem solve Appreciation for non-academic perspectives, knowledge, and expertise For More Information Mindich Program in Engaged Scholarship About Vision Statement History Testimonials Leadership Academics Student Research Opportunities Faculty Curricular Innovation Award Engaged Scholarship Resource Portal (Canvas) Writing Program Preceptor Curricular Innovation Award News and Publicity Student Advisory Committee Quick Links The Institute of Politics Office of Career Services Search Contact Phillips Brooks House 1 Harvard Yard Cambridge, MA 02138 publicservice@fas.harvard.edu (617) 495-5526 Admin Login OpenScholar Copyright Â© 2022 The President and Fellows of Harvard College | Accessibility | Digital Accessibility | Report Copyright Infringement
