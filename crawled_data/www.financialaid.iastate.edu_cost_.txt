Students are assigned a financial aid budget based on their estimated cost of attendance, which is used to determine the maximum amount of financial aid needed. To help with understanding your cost of attendance, planning tools are available. Some of these tools can help you create budgets and lay out costs specific to your enrollment situation. Cost of Attendance Adjustment You may be eligible to complete a cost of attendance adjustment form if your education-related expenses exceed the amount of financial aid included in your cost of attendance. Expense Estimator See a detailed estimate of Iowa State University expenses by using the Expense Estimator.
