Texas Tech presence now in historic Jefferson. Texas Tech University works hard to create a unique college experience for every single student, wherever one may be. Students at every Texas Tech campus are presented with many opportunities to grow. "Texas Tech has several regional teaching sites that allow place-bound students to receive a high-quality degree from a tier one university," said Melanie Hart, vice provost for eLearning & Academic Partnerships at Texas Tech. To that end, Texas Tech officials are pleased to announce its newest regional site, Texas Tech University at Jefferson. The satellite location is at the Jeffersonian Institute in downtown Jefferson. "The Jeffersonian Institute and the Schluter Foundation always wanted to get a tier one university here in Jefferson, and because of the Jeffersonian Institute building here, it makes the perfect satellite location, with the large ballroom area downstairs and the classrooms upstairs," said Brian Brooks, the campus' new program coordinator. For now, there will be two classrooms upstairs at the new Texas Tech site, but Brooks said he hopes for the other rooms to be used as classrooms in the future. TTU Jefferson is ready for advising potential students! TTU Jefferson is ready for advising potential students! Beginning in October 2020, TTU at Jefferson will offer two on-site coding options, Full-Stack Web Development, and Cyber Security certifications from the Texas Tech Coding Academy. Classes will be held two nights a week for nine months. The site will also offer the Full-Stack Web Development course online for any individuals who are not able to take the in-person course. In the coding industry, a student can explore a variety of career choices because there are plenty of programming jobs for them to pursue in the world of technology. These programs prepare students for high-demand careers with starting salaries averaging $50,000 to $60,000 per year and increasing to over $100,000 after gaining a few years' experience according to Career Karma and Salary.com. "These courses allow full web stack developer training, which means if you have a company, a developer can design their website on the front end and provide full network support on the back end," Brooks added. "Texas Tech University at Jefferson is a great place to get a career in coding or cyber security started!" As a student looking to develop the skills required for this industry, Texas Tech University at Jefferson provides a top-tier education. The Texas Tech Coding Academy offers a flexible schedule; in-person, part-time classes meet twice a week in the evenings, so learning to code fits most schedules. A benefit to this is learning in a "flipped classroom" approach, with hands-on classes led by instructors who work as professional developers during the day. To prepare for a career, students can develop skills that employers are looking for, build a professional resume, take part in practice interviews, and more. Texas Tech Coding Academy has its own website, for students to have as many resources as possible. It features a blog, where students can read the latest news from the Texas Tech Coding Academy team on web development, technology, and what's happening in the community. Information is also available about future events, signing up for courses, tuition, and ways the student can contact the college for any questions. In the long run, the goal of Texas Tech University at Jefferson is to become a regional site, but for now, it is a professional development site focusing on professional certifications.
