SENIOR PORTRAITS: FAQ How do I sign up for senior portraits? February 25th is the final date to sit for your senior portraits. If there are no appointments available on the site, we are fully booked. Please continue checking for any cancellations that may occur, however, no new dates will be opening. We are unable to extend them any longer or squeeze anyone in. Sign up HERE using school code 29! When can I take portraits? Portrait sittings began on October 20th and close on February 25th. No more dates will be opening. We are unable to accommodate any students who do not secure an appointment. Sign up HERE using school code 29. May I use another photographer/picture or submit my own portrait? No, Sub Turri has a contract with LifeTouch Studios. We cannot allow students to do this as we would be in legal trouble. How much does this cost? There is NO sitting fee to get your yearbook photo taken (or retaken) and included in the yearbook. You are charged only if you decide to order pictures. What can I expect on the day of my appointment? Portraits will take place in the Sub Turri office, McElroy 103, or in Carney. Please arrive 10 minutes early to Mac 103 for your appointment. You will be told where to go from there. Females should dress in business casual wear and males should wear a shirt/tie/jacket. There will be a standard cap and gown provided for grad shots. Where are my cap and gown photos? If you did not get them with your initial set of proofs, Lifetouch mails cap and gown proofs home the first week of April. Can I order a portrait package that combines cap and gown with the regular portraits? Yes! Just contact a customer service rep online to do so. Is there a deadline for ordering portraits? Lifetouch keeps the proofs for a full academic year. OUR STAFF Each year we have an incredible staff of undergraduate students working to create the book.
