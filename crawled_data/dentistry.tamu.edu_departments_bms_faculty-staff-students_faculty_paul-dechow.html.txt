Throughout his career, he has addressed this area through a variety of biomechanical, material, and morphologic approaches. Early work focused on comparative and morphometric studies of craniofacial form and physiological studies of the muscles of mastication. Specifically, this work concerned the morphology, function, and biomechanics of the masticatory muscles, and the adaptation of the muscles to clinically relevant alterations, such as surgical overloading, detachment, and chronic lengthening. Of particular interest were the relationships between force and speed of masticatory muscles, muscle form, craniofacial growth, and biomechanics. Later and continuing research includes studies of the structural properties, biomechanics, and modeling of the craniofacial skeleton. This work concerns the understanding of the mechanical and elastic properties of bone in the craniofacial region, and the relationship of variations in the properties to the biomechanics of orofacial form and function. The broad question is how do cellular mechanisms of bone growth and remodeling relate to gross skeletal form, function, and evolution. Recent research, funded by NIH, focused on the functional results of surgical and traumatic insults on the basic structures and function of the craniofacial skeleton, and the impact of alteration, such as distraction osteogenesis, bond plating (stress shielding), osteoporosis, or edentulation, on the craniofacial skeleton. The diversity of bone tissue in the craniofacial region makes this an optimal area for exploring the relationship between the microarchitecture of cortical bone and its material properties. These later studies have led to the use of ultrasound, confocal microscopy, 3D computer reconstruction of internal tissue organization, and biomechanical modeling, including finite element analysis, as experimental techniques. A primary interest is the evolution of craniofacial form in humans and other primates. These include the comparative biomechanics, growth, and form of the craniofacial region in both extant and fossil primates, and the relationships between variations in craniofacial structure and function throughout the vertebrates. A major ongoing collaborative project, funded by NSF, is exploring craniofacial structure and feeding mechanics during hominid evolution using advanced techniques of mechanical modeling, structural tissue analysis, and morphological reconstruction of paleontological specimens.
