International Student Requirements We're glad that you're considering Syracuse University! Read about the necessary requirements that an international graduate applicant must complete in order to be considered for admission. Equivalence of a U.S. Bachelor’s Degree As an applicant to a Syracuse graduate program, you’ll need to provide official documentation of having earned at least a U.S. bachelor’s degree (or its equivalent) in another country. Some Syracuse programs require a master’s degree, and this must be officially documented before enrollment as well. Funding Requirements The United States government requires international students to demonstrate sufficient funding for at least the first year of graduate study. Once you’ve done this, Syracuse University can issue the visa eligibility document that you’ll need to have your student visa authorized.
