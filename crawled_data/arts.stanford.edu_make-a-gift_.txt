Over the past several years, great strides have been made in enhancing arts programs for students and faculty. Additionally, the completion of the arts district has made Stanford a cultural destination. This remarkable momentum began with the Arts Initiative during the Stanford Challenge and has continued thanks to the loyal support of donors. These accomplishments have set the stage for the current phase, Arts Leap: Join the Movement. With additional support, Stanford can develop further opportunities for students and faculty to contribute to the arts in critical and imaginative ways—and help define what it means to make, experience, and study art in the 21st century. Ongoing priorities include: Endowed support for scholars including fellowships, professorships, curatorships, directorships Support for Stanford art departments, programs, and museums Funding for collaborations that take advantage of world-class teaching and research across disciplines Frost Amphitheater Gifts of art Funds for visiting artists, art supplies and equipment Arts Leap: Join the Movement Make a Gift Arts Advisory Council Adam Banks (ex officio) Cynthia Lewis Beck ’77, JD ’80 Diana Bowes ’82 Sabrina Buell ’99 Louisa Cheng ’85 Michael Darling ’90 Katharine Duhamel ’83, MBA ’88 Melissa F.
