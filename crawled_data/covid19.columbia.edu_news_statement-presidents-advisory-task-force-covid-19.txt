Consequently, based on the Columbia COVID-19 Monitoring Plan, the University’s alert level also will move from Low (Green) to Medium (Yellow). This change would happen concurrent with the City’s shift. The change in alert level for the City is based on the COVID-19 case rate surpassing the threshold of 200 COVID-19 cases/100,000 people in the past 7 days —a metric and threshold set by the CDC. However, it is important to note that COVID-19 hospitalization indicators -- measures that are more reliable and that better reflect the impact of COVID-19 -- remain reassuringly stable in New York City. For the Columbia community, taking into account the overall situation as described above, the high level of vaccination coverage among Columbia affiliates, and the continued evidence of vaccine and treatment effectiveness against the Omicron variant, we anticipate making no changes in our current campus COVID-19 guidance, unless New York City puts in place measures that we would be required to follow. We will also be adjusting our Monitoring Plan to reflect the latest COVID-19-related information. We continue to closely monitor the epidemiological situation in New York City and on campus and will provide updates as needed.
