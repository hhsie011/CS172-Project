The Digital Media Conundrum: Can Journalism Save Democracy in the Age of Disinformation? The Digital Media Conundrum: Can Journalism Save Democracy in the Age of Disinformation? Columbia Global Centers | Istanbul and the International Press Institute hosted a discussion titled “The Digital Media Conundrum: Can Journalism Save Democracy in the Age of Disinformation?” The event was moderated by Emre Kizilkaya, esteemed journalist and Vice President of the National Committee at the Vienna-based International Press Institute, and welcomed presenters Professor Tirşe Erbaysal Filibeli of Bahçeşehir University and Professor Todd Gitlin of Columbia Journalism School. The purpose of this event was to address fake news, digital echo chambers, and the impact of disinformation on fundamental rights and freedoms. As the sharing of knowledge has grown and reached broader audiences, the unintended consequence of the spread of misinformation and disinformation has also developed. This issue now raises the question of how can society contain disinformation without undermining the ability of knowledge to spread? Funding Independent & Quality Journalism Columbia Global Centers | Istanbul and the International Press Institute hosted a discussion titled “The Digital Media Conundrum: Can Journalism Save Democracy in the Age of Disinformation?” The event was moderated by Onur Sazak, Turkey-based Project Coordinator at International Press Institute (IPI), and welcomed presenters Sheila S. Coronel, director of the Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism and the Stabile Professor of Professional Practice in Investigative Journalism at Columbia University; Kaya Heyse, News Coordinator at Medyascope; and Barbara Trionfi is Executive Director at International Press Institute (IPI). Our distinguished panelists shared their insights on these issues and draw comparisons between how independent journalism could be enhanced with international funding for operations, especially within the context of authoritarian regimes. Understanding and Countering Online Harassment of Women Journalists Columbia Global Centers | Istanbul, in partnership with the International Press Institute (IPI) Turkey National Committee, organized a panel on March 9, 2022, marking International Women's Day. This panel shed light on the online harassment of women journalists and mechanisms to protect the physical and emotional safety of the targeted journalists. Online harassment and violence imperil journalists across the world. Online attacks, abuse, violence, and bullying especially directed at women journalists have significantly increased in the past few years. A cross-country report issued by UNESCO and the International Center for Journalists in 2020 reveals that three out of four women respondents (73 percent) had experienced online violence, and one in five women reported that they experienced physical attacks stemming from the initial online harassment. Many press freedom organizations like International Press Institute (IPI) recognize the severity of this threat to the safety of journalists and implement programs to help newsrooms protect their staff.
