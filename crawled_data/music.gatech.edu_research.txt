Every student majoring in music technology is also a researcher, collaborating with our faculty on groundbreaking topics in one of five labs: GTCMT Website Student Research Showcase Brain Music The Georgia Tech Brain Music Lab is a community gathered around a unique facility combining EEG (brain wave data) and other physiological measurement techniques with new music technologies. Our mission is to engage in research and creative space that brings health and well-being to others. Visit the Brain Music at GTCMT. Computational and Cognitive Musicology The Computational and Cognitive Musicology group aims to answer questions about musical structure and organization, and how people respond to those structures, using scientific methodology. We build user-friendly technologies to assist scholars, educators, and music lovers. Visit Cognitive Musicology at GTCMT. Computational Music for All Enables mass-audience participation in live concert performances through real-time music notation systems, connecting the audience to the performer. This research also develops transformative technologies for music education for STEAM (STEM + Arts) classrooms and studies the impact of music, technology, and creativity on the ways people learn. Visit Computational Music for All at GTCMT. Music Informatics Teaches computers to listen to and understand music, incorporating a variety of topics from the fields of audio content analysis and music processing. It includes such tasks as transcribing musical scores, identifying instruments, or automatically assessing music performances. Visit Music Informatics at GTCMT. Robotic Musicianship Researches methods of creating meaningful musical interactions between humans and machines, through novel experiences and outcomes. This work combines the emotion and expression of human musicians with the power processing and note accuracy of robotics. Visit Robotic Musicianship at GTCMT. Questions?
