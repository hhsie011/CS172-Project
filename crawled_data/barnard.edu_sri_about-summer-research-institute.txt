In 2021, a total of 247 students received funding to conduct faculty-mentored research in laboratories at Barnard College, at Columbia University, at labs around New York City. They also had access to subsidized on-campus housing. In addition to funding and mentorship, SRI provides access to trainings, faculty lectures, and workshops. SRI culminates with the program-wide Lida Orzeck '68 Poster Session, at which students share the findings of their research with mentors, peers, and other guests of the College. The result is an intensive interdisciplinary community of individuals with a shared commitment to excellence in the sciences, and a summer of pathbreaking research conducted at the highest level. Questions about SRI can be sent to sri@barnard.edu.
