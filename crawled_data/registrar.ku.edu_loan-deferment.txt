Occasionally your circumstances may necessitate that a manual deferment form be submitted to your lender. If that is the case, please complete our loan deferment form. Be sure to be in contact with your lender to see if they are a Clearinghouse participant prior to submitting the form to our office. Submission of a deferment form in conjunction of the report from the Clearinghouse may cause problems particularly if there is a discrepancy in the two due to a change in enrollment between the date of the form and the date of the submission. If you have a unique situation, please contact our certification staff to explain your needs. If you are eligible for deferment, but received a collection letter you should: Contact your lender or loan servicer to verify your deferment status. Sometimes deferment forms are received between the time the NSC supplies the information and the lending agency sends out collection letters. If your lender or servicer is unable to verify your deferment, contact the National Student Clearinghouse at: Phone: 703-742-4200 Customer Service hours: Mon.-Thu., 9 am-7 pm and Fri., 9 am-5 pm EST) E-mail: service@studentclearinghouse.org Fax: 703-742-7792 Mail: National Student Clearinghouse 13454 Sunrise Valley Dr., Suite 300 Herndon, VA 20171. Web: www.studentclearinghouse.org If an emergency exists - ie: you are being threatened with default - the Clearinghouse will contact the lender with the appropriate information and ensure the proper form is processed on a high priority basis.
