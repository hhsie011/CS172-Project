Our faculty have long upheld the principle that law must be studied within the context of its ultimate humanity. As part of a great American research university, they recognize that this principle demands the same dedication, enthusiasm, and critical spirit that infuses all liberal study. Our students thrive in a diverse and resource-rich atmosphere that is intellectually invigorating, professionally supportive, and forward-thinking. This is precisely why we are known for producing well-rounded lawyers and accomplished practitioners cut from a different cloth – “lawyers in the best sense.” General Information Degree Programs Law School Courses Faculty Back to Top | Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Global Search Courses of Study Search Choose Search Location Select an option Courses Departments & Fields of Study College Items College Content Entire Courses of Study Search Keyword Field Whole Word/Phrase Advanced Search Courses of Study Home Course Descriptions Colleges, Schools, and Units Agriculture and Life Sciences Architecture, Art and Planning Arts and Sciences Athletics and Physical Education Biological Sciences Bowers College of Computing and Information Science Brooks School of Public Policy Continuing Education and Summer Sessions Cornell Tech Division of Nutritional Sciences eCornell Engineering Graduate School Human Ecology Industrial and Labor Relations Law School Officer Education SC Johnson College of Business - Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management - Hotel Administration - Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management Veterinary Medicine My Favorites All courses of study © 2022 Cornell University.
