Print Degree Planner (opens a new window) | Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Facebook this Page (opens a new window) Tweet this Page (opens a new window) Master of Science in Education, Secondary Education Concentration This program is designed to help career secondary classroom teachers upgrade their skills, become informed about new ideas in secondary teaching and prepare for curriculum leadership roles in public and private schools. The graduate program builds upon teacher preparation in the Single Subject Credential Program. Whereas coursework in the credential program focuses on knowledge and skills necessary for a beginning secondary teacher, the graduate program will allow students to extend their knowledge and deepen their skills in curriculum design, instructional and assessment strategies, integration of technology and reflection skills. Online Graduate Program Features The graduate programs in Secondary Education are delivered in two formats: 1) an online hybrid format, with 49 percent of courses delivered entirely via web-based instruction, and the other courses delivered partially via web-based instruction; 2) a 100 percent online format. The programs begin with a required one-unit prerequisite course. Options for Culminating Experience The options for candidates’ culminating experiences are the comprehensive examination, action research project, thesis, submission for National Board Certification, development of a comprehensive curriculum project or development of an article for publication. Application Deadlines Deadlines for completing the online application are July 1 for the fall semester and Nov. 15 for the spring semester (http://www.csumentor.edu). Spring starts are not always available and are dependent upon student enrollment. Students should always check the program website for the latest information regarding admissions deadlines. Admission to Graduate Standing - Conditionally Classified Students must meet the CSU requirements for admission to a master’s degree program. Please consult the Graduate Admissions section in this catalog for complete information. Graduate Standing - Classified Classified standing is granted after a study plan is developed in consultation with a faculty adviser and approved by the Associate Vice President, Academic Programs (or designee). Students must also meet the following admission requirements: an approved major; grade-point average of 3.0 on previous academic and related work; proof of a current teaching credential; current professional resume; 500-word statement of purpose outlining your interest in the Secondary Education Master’s Program (e.g., any areas of special interest or emphasis you plan to pursue as a graduate student, a brief description of your current teaching position or anything else that would facilitate an informed decision on your application); and two or more letters of recommendation that address your aptitude for graduate study including your teaching skills as well as your academic preparation. Grade-point average deficiencies may be removed by a demonstration of competency in the graduate program. Emphasis in Teacher Induction (30 UNITS) The concentration in Secondary Education with an Emphasis in Teacher Induction is designed for 7-12 grade teachers to earn their Professional Clear Credential and to prepare them for continued instructional and leadership roles in secondary schools. This graduate program builds upon teacher preparation in the Single Subject Credential Program and allows students to extend their knowledge and deepen their teaching skills while working toward the Clear Credential. Students should contact their BTSA support provider for additional information regarding their eligibility for this area of emphasis.
