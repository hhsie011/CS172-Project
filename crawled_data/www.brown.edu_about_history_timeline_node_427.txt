The small Brown squad and the rest of the travel party took a special Pullman car to Pasadena. The journey lasted six days and was described as “a corking good trip.” Separated from their equipment trunks along the way, the team played in borrowed uniforms and, more importantly, without mud cleats, losing to Washington State 14–0 in a heavy rainstorm.
