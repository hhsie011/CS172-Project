These special visitors may be involved in the practice, creation, or study of Christian music. Presenters are on campus for a three- to four-day residency and are available to speak in classes, make public presentations, and visit with students in small group settings. Winter 2022 - Heather Sorenson - EVENT CANCELED. Heather Sorenson entered the church music industry in her twenties, and her name quickly became a welcomed fixture in the publishing world. Heather is hired by the largest and most respected publishers in the world, and her pieces remain at the top of Bestsellers lists and Editor's Choice selections. Diversity is the characteristic that makes Heather somewhat of an anomaly in the industry: she easily maneuvers both the traditional and contemporary genres of Christian music, often combining the two for a unique blend that has become her artistic fingerprint. Initially recognized for her skill as a pianist, Heather is now known for her compositions in choral anthems, solo piano collections, and orchestrations. Her works are performed regularly at competitions, concerts, recitals, and churches worldwide.
