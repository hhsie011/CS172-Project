Therefore, we want you to be educated in all the aspects of research before you decide to participate. It is important to consider the level of risk and compare it to any benefits when deciding whether or not to participate in human subjectâ€™s research. The U.S. Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) has developed resources for you to learn about participating in research and making informed decision. Visit their "About Research Participation" page. Participants can also view the OHRP brochure "Becoming a Research Volunteer: It's Your Decision". People considering involvement in a research study should know that they have certain rights as a research participant. More information below. For more information on children participating in research, please see this page. Informed consent You are likely to be presented with an informed consent form indicating approval by the IRB. This document is intended to provide you with relevant information necessary to decide whether or not you want to participate. This form itself should be coupled with a discussion of the research. Generally, informed consent will involve a description of the following: An explanation of the purpose of the research. A description of what you will be asked to do and how long it will take should you participate and whether or not you will be compensated for your time. A description of any risks involved in participating. These risks could be physical, psychological, social or criminal. The steps taken to minimize these risks should also be described. A description of any benefits to you or to society as a whole. The degree to which the information will be kept confidential. Who to contact should you have questions about the research or about your rights as a participant. A statement that you are free not to participate and can stop participating at any time. Voluntary participation Any participation in a research study is completely voluntary. You are free to decline to participate for any reason. You may also stop participating at any time or refuse to answer any individual questions. Even after you sign the consent form, you can stop. Should you decide to decline or stop participating, this decision will in no way influence any services to which you are otherwise entitled. For example, if you are a student, your teacher or professor cannot hold this against you when determining your grade. If you are receiving treatment, that treatment cannot be withheld if you do not agree to participate. Whether or not you participate is entirely up to you. You should not sign the form agreeing to the research until all of your questions have been answered to your satisfaction. Signing this form does not waive any of your legal rights or alter your ability to stop participating at a later time. You should be given a copy of the form to take with you in case you have questions later. The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) provides leadership in the protection of the rights, welfare, and wellbeing of subjects involved in research conducted or supported by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Questions to ask Why is the research being done? What will be done to me as part of the research? How will I benefit from the research? Could the research hurt me? What will the researcher do with my information? Will the research cost me anything? Who pays if I'm unexpectedly injured in the study? How long will the study last? What happens if I decide to leave the study early? Who should I call if I have a question about the research? QUESTIONS/CONCERNS ABOUT A STUDY: The Consent form you receive when you are invited to be a research subject includes some contact information if you have questions or concerns about the study. You are encouraged to contact the researcher if you have questions. QUESTIONS ABOUT RIGHTS AS A RESEARCH SUBJECT: Call the office at 502.852.5188 or toll free at 1.800.334.UofL (8635).
