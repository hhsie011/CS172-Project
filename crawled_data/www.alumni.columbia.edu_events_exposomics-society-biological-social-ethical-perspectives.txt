We have sought to organize thematic sessions, each bringing together biomedical science researchers with social scientists and epidemiologists, to explore how exposure to environmental factors interacts with genomic, epigenetic and cellular processes, and may have an unequal and disproportionate impact on marginalized communities, leading to life-long health disparities. We strongly believe that the overall success of the conference depends on facing the issues from both sides and fostering a conversation that cuts across disciplinary boundaries. 8:15a- Registration opens 8:45a- Opening Remarks by Gil Eyal, PhD Keynote Speakers 9:00a- Gary W.
