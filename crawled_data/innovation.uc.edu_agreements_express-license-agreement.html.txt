ARTICLE 3. DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION 3.1. Diligence 3.1.1. General. Licensee shall use commercially reasonable efforts and shall cause its Sublicensees to use commercially reasonable efforts: (a) to develop Licensed products in accordance with the Development Plan; (b) to introduce Licensed Products into the commercial market; and (c) to market Licensed Products following such introduction into the market. In addition, Licensee, by itself or through its Affiliates or Sublicensees, shall achieve each of the Development Milestones within the time periods specified in Exhibit A. 3.2. Adjustments of Development Plan. Licensee will be entitled, from time to time, to make adjustments to the then applicable Development Plan as Licensee believes, in its good faith judgment, are needed in order to improve Licensee’s ability to meet the Development Milestones. 3.3. Reporting. Within sixty (60) days after the end of each calendar year, Licensee shall furnish UC with a written report summarizing, its Affiliates and its Sublicensinsee’s efforts, during the prior year to develop and commercialize Licensed Products, including: (a) research and development activities completed; (b) commercialization and/or other distribution efforts, including significant corporate transactions involving Licensed Products; and (c) marketing efforts. Each report must contain a sufficient level of detail for UC to assess whether Licensee is in compliance with its obligations under Section 3.1 and a discussion of intended efforts for the then current year. Together with each report, Licensee shall provide UC with a copy of the then current Development Plan, including an updated schedule of anticipated events or milestones. 3.4. Failure to Meet Development Milestone; Opportunity to Cure. If Licensee believes that it will not achieve a Development Milestone, it may notify UC in writing in advance of the relevant deadline. Licensee shall include with such notice (a) a reasonable explanation of the reasons for such failure (and lack of finances will not constitute reasonable basis for such failure) (“Explanation”) and (b) a reasonably detailed, written plan for promptly achieving a reasonable extended and/or amended milestone (“Plan”). If Licensee so notifies UC, but fails to provide UC with both an Explanation and Plan, the Licensee will have an additional thirty (30) days or until the original deadline of the relevant Development Milestone, whichever is later, to meet such milestone. Licensee’s failure to do so shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement and UC shall have the right to terminate this Agreement forthwith. If Licensee so notifies UC and provides UC with an Explanation and Plan, both of which are acceptable to UC in its reasonable discretion (e.g. Licensee asserts lack of finances or development preference for a non‐Licensed Product), the Licensee will have an additional thirty (30) days or until the original deadline of the relevant Development Milestone, whichever is later, to meet such milestone. Licensee’s failure to do so shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement and UC shall have the right to terminate this Agreement forthwith. If Licensee so notifies UC and provides UC with an Explanation and Plan, but the Plan is not acceptable to UC in its reasonable discretion, then UC will explain to Licensee why the Plan is not acceptable and provide Licensee with suggestions for an acceptable Plan. Licensee will have one opportunity to provide UC with an acceptable within ninety (90) days, during which time UC agrees to work with Licensee in its effort to develop an acceptable Plan. If, within such ninety (90) days, Licensee fails to provide an acceptable Plan, the Licensee will have an additional thirty (30) days or until the original deadline of the relevant Development Milestone, whichever is later, to meet such milestone. Licensee’s failure to do so shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement and UC shall have the right to terminate this Agreement forthwith. For clarity, if Licensee fails to achieve a Development Milestone and does not avail itself of the procedure set forth in this Section 3.4, such failure shall be a material breach that entitles UC to proceed under Section 10.2.2.1. ARTICLE 4. CONSIDERATION FOR LICENSE 4.1. License Issuance Fee. Licensee shall pay UC a non‐refundable, non‐creditable and nonrecoverable license fee of one thousand fifteen hundred U.S. Dollars ($1,500), due and payable within sixty (60) days of the Effective Date. 4.2.

If the outcome of such Challenge Proceeding is a determination against the Challenging Party, (a) the royalty rate specified in Section 4.5.1 with respect to Net Sales of Licensed Products that are covered by the Patent Rights that are the subject of such Challenge Proceeding shall remain at such doubled rate and (b) Licensee shall reimburse UC for all expenses incurred by UC (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) in connection with such Challenge Proceeding. UC may invoice Licensee on a quarterly basis with respect to such costs and expenses and Licensee shall make payment within thirty (30) days after receipt of such invoice. If the outcome of such Challenge Proceeding is a determination in favor of the Challenging Party, Licensee will have no right to recoup any royalties paid before or during the pendency of such Challenge Proceeding. 4.7.

Licensee shall maintain, and shall cause its Affiliates and Sublicensees to maintain, complete and accurate records of Licensed Products that are made, used, sold, leased or transferred under this Agreement, any amounts payable to UC in relation to such Licensed Products, and all Non‐Royalty Sublicense Income received by Licensee and its Affiliates, which records shall contain sufficient information to permit UC to confirm the accuracy of any reports or notifications delivered to UC under Section 5.1. Licensee, its Affiliates and/or its Sublicensees, as applicable, shall retain such records relating to a given Calendar Quarter for at least five (5) years after the conclusion of that Calendar Quarter, during which time UC will have the right, at its expense, to cause an independent, certified public accountant (or, in the event of a non‐financial audit, other appropriate auditor) to inspect such records during normal business hours for the purposes of verifying the accuracy of any reports and payments delivered under this Agreement and Licensee’s compliance with the terms hereof. Such accountant or other auditor, as applicable, shall not disclose to UC any information other than information relating to the accuracy of reports and payments delivered under this Agreement. The parties shall reconcile any underpayment or overpayment within thirty (30) days after the accountant delivers the results of the audit. If any audit performed under this Section 5.3 reveals an underpayment in excess of five percent (5%) in any calendar year, Licensee shall reimburse UC for all amounts incurred in connection with such audit. UC may exercise its rights under this Section 5.3 only once every year per audited entity and only with reasonable prior notice to the ‐ and will be compounded quarterly. Payment of such interest by Licensee shall not limit, in any way, UC’s right to exercise any other remedies UC may have as a consequence of the lateness of any payment. 5.4. Payment Method. Each payment due to UC under this Agreement shall be paid by check or wire transfer of funds to UC’s account in accordance with written instructions provided by UC. If made by wire transfer, such payments shall be marked so as to refer to this Agreement. 5.5. Withholding and Similar Taxes. All amounts to be paid to UC pursuant to this Agreement shall be without deduction of exchange, collection, or other charges, and, specifically, without deduction of withholding or similar taxes or other government imposed fees or taxes, except as permitted in the definition of Net Sales. ARTICLE 6. PATENT FILING, PROSECUTION AND MAINTENANCE 6.1. Control. UC will be responsible for the preparation, filing, prosecution, protection, defense and maintenance of all Patent Rights, using independent patent counsel reasonably acceptable to Licensee. UC will: (a) instruct such patent counsel to furnish the Licensee with copies of all correspondence relating to the Patent Rights from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and any other patent office, as well as copies of all proposed responses to such correspondence in time for Licensee to review and comment on such response; (b) give Licensee an opportunity to review the text of each patent application before filing; (c) consult with Licensee with respect thereto; (d) supply Licensee with a copy of the application as filed, together with notice of its filing date and serial number; and (e) keep Licensee advised of the status of actual and prospective patent filings. UC shall give Licensee the opportunity to provide comments on and make requests of UC concerning the preparation, filing, prosecution, protection, defense and maintenance of the Patent Rights, and shall seriously consider such comments and requests; however, final decision‐making authority shall vest in UC. In particular, and without intending to limit any of UC’s rights pursuant to this Agreement, UC expressly reserves the right to decline Licensee’s request to file, prosecute, maintain or defend any of the Patent Rights in any Developing Country(ies) unless (i) Licensee demonstrates to UC’s reasonable satisfaction that the filing, prosecution, maintenance or defense of such Patent Rights in such Developing Country(ies) would materially increase the locally‐affordable availability of Licensed Products or equivalents thereof (e.g., generic products) in those and/or other Developing Country(ies) and (ii) the provisions of Section 7 notwithstanding, Licensee agrees that UC shall hold final decision‐making authority, on a case‐by‐case basis, as to whether Licensee will be permitted to enforce such Patent Rights in such Developing Country(ies). 6.2. Expenses. Subject to Section 6.3 below, Licensee shall reimburse UC for all documented, out of pocket expenses incurred by UC pursuant to this Article 6 within thirty (30) days after the date of each invoice from UC for such expenses. In addition, within thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, Licensee shall reimburse UC for all documented, out‐of‐pocket expenses incurred by UC prior to the Effective Date with respect to the preparation, filing, prosecution, protection and maintenance of Patent Rights. 6.3. Abandonment. If Licensee decides that it does not wish to pay for the prosecution or maintenance of any Patent Rights in a particular country, Licensee shall provide UC with prompt written notice of such election. Upon receipt of such notice by UC, Licensee shall be released from its obligation to reimburse UC for such expenses incurred thereafter as to such Patent Rights; provided, however, that expenses authorized prior to the receipt by UC of such notice shall be deemed incurred prior to the notice. In the event of Licensee’s election hereunder to no longer pay for prosecution or maintenance of any Patent Rights, any license granted by UC to Licensee hereunder with respect to such Patent Rights will terminate, and Licensee will have not rights whatsoever to exploit such Patent rights. UC will then be free, without further notice or obligation to Licensee, to grant rights in and to such Patent Rights to Third Parties. 6.4. Small Entity Designation. If Licensee, its Affiliates, any Sublicensee and/or any holder of an option to obtain a Sublicense does not qualify, or at any point during the Term ceases to qualify, as an entity entitled to pay lesser fees as provided by the USPTO (i.e., a “small entity”) or the patent office of any other country, Licensee shall so notify UC immediately, in order to enable UC to comply with regulations regarding payment of fees with respect to Patent Rights. 6.5. Marking. Licensee shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and Sublicensees to, mark all Licensed Products sold or otherwise disposed of in such a manner as to conform with the patent laws and practice of the country to which such products are shipped or in which such products are sold for purposes of ensuring maximum enforceability of Patent Rights in such country. Enforcement of Patent Rights. 7.1. Notice. In the event either party becomes aware of any possible or actual infringement of any Patent Rights with respect to Licensed Products in the Field and in the Territory (an “Infringement”), that party shall promptly notify the other party in writing and provide it with details regarding such Infringement. 7.2. Suit by Licensee. Licensee shall have the first right, but not the obligation, to take action in the prosecution, prevention, or termination of any Infringement. Before Licensee commences an action with respect to any Infringement, Licensee shall consider in good faith the views of UC and potential effects on the public interest in making its decision whether to sue. Should Licensee elect to bring suit against an infringer, Licensee shall keep UC reasonably informed of the progress of the action and shall give UC a reasonable opportunity in advance to consult with Licensee and offer its views about major decisions affecting the litigation. Licensee shall give careful consideration to those views, but shall have the right to control the action; provided, however, that if Licensee fails to defend in good faith the validity and/or enforceability of the Patent Rights in the action or, or if Licensee’s license to a Valid Claim in the suit terminates, UC may elect to take control of the action pursuant to Section 7.3. Any and all expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred by UC with respect to the prosecution, adjudication and/or settlement of such suit, including any related appeals, shall be paid for entirely by Licensee and Licensee shall hold UC free, clear and harmless from and against any and all such expenses. The expenses of such suit or suits that Licensee elects to bring, including any expenses of UC incurred in conjunction with the prosecution of such suits or the settlement thereof, shall be paid for entirely by Licensee and Licensee shall hold UC free, clear and harmless from and against any and all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys’ fees. Licensee shall not compromise or settle such litigation without the prior written consent of UC, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event Licensee exercises its right to sue pursuant to this Section 7.2, it shall first reimburse itself out of any sums recovered in such suit or in settlement thereof for all costs and expenses of every kind and character, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, necessarily incurred in the prosecution of any such suit. If, after such reimbursement, any funds shall remain from said recovery, then UC shall receive an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of such funds and the remaining ninety percent (90%) of such funds shall be retained by Licensee. 7.3. Suit by UC. If Licensee does not take action in the prosecution, prevention, or termination of any Infringement pursuant to Section 7.2 above, and has not commenced negotiations with the infringer for the discontinuance of said Infringement, within ninety (90) days after receipt of notice to Licensee by UC of the existence of an Infringement, UC may elect to do so. Should UC elect to bring suit against an infringer, Licensee shall agree to be entered as a party in the suit for jurisdictional reasons. If Licensee is joined as party plaintiff in any such suit, Licensee shall have the right to approve the counsel selected by UC to represent UC and Licensee, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. Any and all expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred by Licensee with respect to the prosecution, adjudication and/or settlement of such suit, including any related appeals, shall be paid for entirely by UC and UC shall hold Licensee free, clear and harmless from and against any and all such expenses. UC shall not compromise or settle such litigation without the prior written consent of Licensee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event UC exercises its right to sue pursuant to this Section 7.3, it shall first reimburse itself out of any sums recovered in such suit or in settlement thereof for all costs and expenses of every kind and character, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, necessarily incurred in the prosecution of any such suit. If, after such reimbursement, any funds shall remain from said recovery, then Licensee shall receive an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of such funds and the remaining ninety percent (90%) of such funds shall be retained by UC. 7.4. Own Counsel. Each party shall always have the right to be represented by counsel of its own selection and at its own expense in any suit instituted under this Article 7 by the other party for Infringement. 7.5. Cooperation. Each party agrees to cooperate fully in any action under this Article 7 that is controlled by the other party, provided that the controlling party reimburses the cooperating party promptly for any costs and expenses incurred by the cooperating party, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, in connection with providing such assistance. 7.6. Declaratory Judgment. If a declaratory judgment action is brought naming Licensee and/or any of its Affiliates or Sublicensees as a defendant and alleging invalidity or unenforceability of any claims within the Patent Rights, Licensee shall promptly notify UC in writing and UC may elect, upon written notice to License within thirty (30) days after UC receives notice of the commencement of such action, to take over the sole defense of the invalidity and/or unenforceability aspect of the action at its own expense. Express License Agreement ARTICLE 8. WARRANTIES; LIMITATION OF LIABIL 8.1. Compliance with Law. Licensee represents and warrants that it will comply, and will ensure that its Affiliates and Sublicensees comply, with all local, state, federal and international laws and regulations relating to the development, manufacture, use, sale and importation of Licensed Products. Without limiting the foregoing, Licensee represents and warrants, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and Sublicensees, that they shall comply with all United States laws and regulations controlling the export of certain commodities and technical data, including without limitation all Export Administration Regulations of the United States Department of Commerce. Among other things, these laws and regulations prohibit or require a license for the export of certain types of commodities and technical data to specified countries. Licensee hereby gives written assurance that it will comply with, and will cause its Affiliates and Sublicensees to comply with, all United States export control laws and regulations, that it bears sole responsibility for any violation of such laws and regulations by itself or its Affiliates or Sublicensees, and that it will indemnify, defend, and hold the Indemnitees harmless (in accordance with Section 9.1) for the consequences of any such violation. 8.2. No Warranty. 8.2.1. NOTHING CONTAINED HEREIN SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE A WARRANTY BY UC THAT IT CAN OR WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN PATENTS ON PATENT APPLICATIONS INCLUDED IN THE PATENT RIGHTS, OR THAT ANY OF THE PATENT RIGHTS WILL AFFORD ADEQUATE OR COMMERCIALLY WORTHWHILE PROTECTION. 8.2.2. UC MAKES NO WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER AS TO THE COMMERCIAL OR SCIENTIFIC VALUE OF THE PATENT RIGHTS OR UC TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER MATERIALS. UC MAKES NO REPRESENTATION THAT THE PRACTICE OF THE PATENT RIGHTS OR USE OF THE UC TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER MATERIALS OR THE DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE, USE, SALE OR IMPORTATION OF ANY LICENSED PRODUCT OR THE PRACTICE OF ANY LICENSED METHOD, OR ANY ELEMENT THEREOF, WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY PATENT OR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. 8.2.3. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO ANY TECHNOLOGY, PATENTS, GOODS, SERVICES, RIGHTS OR OTHER SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO ANY AND ALL OF THE FOREGOING. 8.3. Limitation of Liability. 8.3.1. UC will not be liable to Licensee, its Affiliates, any Sublicensee, or any of their Affiliates with respect to any subject matter of this Agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for (a) any indirect, incidental, consequential or punitive damages or lost profits or (b) cost of procurement of substitute goods, technology or services. 8.3.2. UC’s aggregate liability for all damages of any kind arising out of or relating to this Agreement or its subject matter under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory shall not exceed the amounts paid to UC under this Agreement Express License Agreement ARTICLE 9. INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE 9.1. Indemnity. 9.1.1. Licensee shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless UC and its current and former directors, governing board members, trustees, officers, faculty, medical and professional staff, employees, students, and agents and their respective successors, heirs and assigns (collectively, the “Indemnitees”) from and against any claim, liability, cost, expense, damage, deficiency, loss or obligation of any kind or nature (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs and expenses of litigation), based upon, arising out of, or otherwise relating to this Agreement or any Sublicense, including any cause of action relating to product liability concerning any product, process, or service made, used, sold or performed pursuant to any right or license granted under this Agreement (collectively, “Claims”). Neither Licensee nor UC shall settle any Claim without the prior written consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 9.1.2. Licensee shall, at its own expense, provide attorneys reasonably acceptable to UC to defend against any actions brought or filed against any Indemnitee hereunder with respect to the subject of indemnity contained herein, whether or not such actions are rightfully brought. 9.2. Insurance. 9.2.1. Beginning at the time any Licensed Product is being commercially distributed or sold (other than for the purpose of obtaining regulatory approvals) by Licensee, or by an Affiliate, Sublicensee or agent of Licensee, Licensee shall, at its sole cost and expense, procure and maintain commercial general liability insurance in amounts not less than $5,000,000 per incident and $5,000,000 annual aggregate and naming the Indemnitees as additional insureds. During clinical trials of any such Licensed Product, Licensee shall, at its sole cost and expense, procure and maintain commercial general liability insurance in such equal or lesser amount as UC shall require, naming the Indemnitees as additional insureds. Such commercial general liability insurance shall provide: (a) product liability coverage and (b) broad form contractual liability coverage for Licensee’s indemnification obligations under this Agreement. 9.2.2. If Licensee elects to self‐insure all or part of the limits described above in Section 9.2.1 (including deductibles or retentions that are in excess of $250,000 annual aggregate) such self‐insurance program must be acceptable to UC and UC’s insurer in their sole discretion. Page 20 of 27 The minimum amounts of insurance coverage required shall not be construed to create a limit of Licensee’s liability with respect to its indemnification obligations under this Agreement. 9.2.3. Licensee shall provide UC with written evidence of such insurance upon request of UC. Licensee shall provide UC with written notice at least fifteen (15) days prior to the cancellation, non‐renewal or material change in such insurance.

Licensee shall maintain such commercial general liability insurance beyond the expiration or termination of this Agreement during: (a) the period that any Licensed Product is being commercially distributed or sold by Licensee, or an Affiliate, Sublicensee or agent of Licensee; and (b) a reasonable period after the period referred to in (a) above which in no event shall be less than fifteen (15) years. ARTICLE 10. TERM AND TERMINATION 10.1. Term.

If Licensee defaults in its obligations under Section 9.2 to procure and maintain insurance, or, if Licensee has in any event failed to comply with the notice requirements contained therein, then UC may terminate this Agreement immediately without notice or additional waiting period. 10.2.2.3. UC shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.4. 10.3. Effect of Termination. 10.3.1. Termination of Rights. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement by either party pursuant to any of the provisions of Section 10.2: (a) the rights and licenses granted to Licensee under Article 2 shall terminate, all rights in and to and under the Patent Rights will revert to UC and neither Licensee nor its Affiliates may make any further use or exploitation of the Patent Rights; and (b) any existing agreements that contain a Sublicense shall terminate to the extent of such Sublicense; provided, however, that, for each Sublicensee, upon termination of the Sublicense agreement with such Sublicensee, if the Sublicensee is not then in breach of its Sublicense agreement with Licensee such that Licensee would have the right to terminate such Sublicense, such Sublicensee shall have the right to seek a license from UC. UC agrees to negotiate such licenses in good faith under reasonable terms and conditions, which shall not impose any representations, warranties, obligations or liabilities on UC that are not included in this Agreement. 10.3.2. Accruing Obligations. Termination or expiration of this Agreement shall not relieve the parties of obligations accruing prior to such termination or expiration, including obligations to pay amounts accruing hereunder up to the date of termination or expiration. After the date of termination or expiration (except in the case of termination by UC pursuant to Section 10.2), Licensee, its Affiliates and Sublicensees (a) may sell Licensed Products then in stock and (b) may complete the production of Licensed Products then in the process of production and sell the same; provided that, in the case of both (a) and (b), Licensee shall pay the applicable royalties and payments to UC in accordance with Article 4, provide reports and audit rights to UC pursuant to Article 5 and maintain insurance in accordance with the requirements of Section 9.2. The parties agree that the obligations in Section 4.1 (License Issuance Fee), and Section 6.2 (Patent Expenses) will accrue immediately upon execution of this Agreement by both parties, regardless of the events, invoice and payment timing details set forth therein. 10.3.3. Regulatory Filings. Licensee shall have the exclusive right to prepare and present all regulatory filings necessary or appropriate in any country and to obtain and maintain any regulatory approval required to market Licensed Products in any such country.

UC shall be entitled to freely use and to grant others the right to use all such materials and documents delivered pursuant to this Section 10.3.3. 10.3.4. Survival. The parties’ respective rights, obligations and duties under Articles 5, 9, 10 and 11 and Sections 4.2, 4.7, 8.2 and 8.3, as well as any rights, obligations and duties which by their nature extend beyond the expiration or termination of this Agreement, shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement.

Any grant or creation of a security interest purported or attempted to be made in violation of the terms of this Section 11.2 shall be null and void and of no legal effect. 11.3. Use of Name. Except as provided below, Licensee shall not, and shall ensure that its Affiliates and Sublicensees shall not, use or register the name “UC” (alone or as part of another name) or any logos, seals, insignia or other words, names, symbols or devices that identify UC or any UC school, unit, division or affiliate (“UC Names”) for any purpose except with the prior written approval of, and in accordance with restrictions required by, UC. Without limiting the foregoing, Licensee shall, and shall ensure that its Affiliates and Sublicensees shall, cease all use of UC Names on the termination or expiration of this Agreement except as otherwise approved by UC. This restriction shall not apply to any information required by law to be disclosed to any governmental entity. 11.4. Entire Agreement.

Any action, suit or other proceeding arising under or relating to this Agreement (a “Suit”) shall be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Ohio, and the parties hereby consent to the sole jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in the State of Ohio. Each party agrees not to raise any objection at any time to the laying or maintaining of the venue of any Suit in any of the specified courts, irrevocably waives any claim that Suit has been brought in any inconvenient forum and further irrevocably waives the right to object, with respect to any Suit, that such court does not have any jurisdiction over such party. 11.7.

No waiver by either party of any condition or of the breach of any term contained in this Agreement, whether by conduct, or otherwise, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be, or considered as, a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or of the breach of such term or any other term of this Agreement. 11.11. Force Majeure. Except for monetary obligations hereunder, neither party will be responsible for delays resulting from causes beyond the reasonable control of such party, including fire, explosion, flood, war, strike, or riot, provided that the nonperforming party uses commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or remove such causes of nonperformance and continues performance under this Agreement with reasonable dispatch whenever such causes are removed. 11.12. No Agency or Partnership. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give either party the right to bind the other, or be deemed to constitute either party as agent for or partner of the other or any third party. 11.13. Assignments and Successors. This Agreement may not be assigned by either party without the consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, except that each party may, without such consent, assign this Agreement and the rights, obligations and interests of such party to any purchaser of all or substantially all of its assets or all of its equity, or to any successor corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation of such party with or into such corporation; provided, in each case, that the assignee agrees in writing\ to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.

Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is or becomes invalid or is ruled invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction or is deemed unenforceable, it is the intention of the parties that the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected.
