Traditionally bound to two-dimensional architectural representations, paper engineers construct three dimensional forms that emerge from within the book and allow the viewer to move around and through buildings, viewing plans and elevations -- often simultaneously. Visit Greece, India, Japan, and Mexico and explore the works of Frank Gehry, Wendy Evans Joseph and M.C. Escher, through pop-ups constructed by award-winning paper engineers such as Courtney Watson McCarthy, Anton Radevsky, and Dario Cestaro. This collection was initially developed to entertain the children of students who needed a quiet moment in the library and has since grown to encompass more than 50 volumes. In addition to the 20 volumes on display, another 30 volumes are available for interactive exploration. Open daily.
