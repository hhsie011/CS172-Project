By building a community-engaged learning curriculum on endangered and indigenous languages, this team is raising awareness about this issue and collaborating on language maintenance, revitalization and documentation. The grant project includes continued development of a community-based online project for revitalizing the Onondaga language, adding endangered languages to new and current linguistics courses, introducing student field projects and mentoring student interns working with speakers of minority languages.
