The goals of the Master of Arts program in Communication Studies are to provide students with a rigorous educational experience, to develop an advanced understanding of the human communication process, to increase awareness of the interdisciplinary nature of the communication field, and to develop oral, written, critical thinking, and research skills. Students complete coursework in persuasion, interpersonal, intercultural, organizational, and health communication together with research methods applicable to these areas. Two programs are offered. The thesis program emphasizes the student’s development of research skills under faculty supervision (30 credits). The non-thesis program focuses on a theoretical foundation with emphasis on applied communication (36 credits). Students will be prepared for leadership positions in public or private organizations at the national or international level, or pursue advance degrees.
