Abstract: This talk draws together concepts in Black geographies and critical physical geography to examine the linkages between racial and environmental histories in Black environmental justice communities along the U.S. Gulf Coast. Specifically, this talk considers the notion of ecological memory, a natural science concept that refers to how past states or processes influence present or future responses in ecological communities, and its compatibility with threads within Black geographies and Black studies, in particular the afterlife of slavery. The afterlife of slavery refers to the precarity and devaluation of Black life set in motion by chattel slavery. Heeding calls within critical physical geography to take seriously the biophysical and social co-constitution of landscapes, I put forth the concept of the biophysical afterlife of slavery to describe how the precarity and devaluation of Black life has impacted the natural environments in which these Black lives exist. In this talk, I will discuss a framework I have developed that draws together the reconstruction of environmental histories with analyses of the past, present, and future of the biophysical afterlife of slavery: using dendrochronology and trees as archives of the biophysical afterlife of slavery, as well as witnesses to Black life and sense of place in environmentally precarious spaces over time. This research focuses on a case study of Port Arthur, Texas, a historically Black community nestled in what the US Environmental Protection Agency calls “the largest oil refinery network in the world”. DeFord Lecture Series Since the 1940’s, the DeFord (Technical Sessions) lecture series, initially the official venue for disseminating DGS graduate student research, is a forum for lectures by distinguished visitors and members of our community. This is made possible through a series of endowments. × Faculty MeetingStart: May 3, 2022 at 12:30 pm End: May 3, 2022 at 1:45 pm × DGS Awards CeremonyStart: May 3, 2022 at 4:00 pm End: May 3, 2022 at 5:00 pm Location: Boyd Lecture Hall × TBD - Bureau Seminar SeriesStart: May 6, 2022 at 9:00 am End: May 6, 2022 at 10:00 am Location: TBD Contact: Dena Miller, dena.miller@beg.utexas.edu View Event Bureau Seminar Series × WCE Seminar | Nilay Dogulu - RCRC Climate CentreStart: May 6, 2022 at 12:00 pm End: May 6, 2022 at 1:00 pm Location: Online Contact: Cansu Demir, cdemir@utexas.edu View Event Speaker: Nilay Dogulu (Consultant research lead at Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre and independent researcher) Title: Applications of Clustering Methods in Hydrology Zoom link: https://utexas.zoom.us/j/93865487444 × Bureau Seminar Series - Zoltan Sylvester, PhD, Bureau QCL Start: May 13, 2022 at 9:00 am End: May 13, 2022 at 10:00 am Location: TBD Contact: Dena Miller, dena.miller@beg.utexas.edu View Event Bureau Seminar Series × Doctoral Defense | Anna Turetcaia Start: May 13, 2022 at 2:00 pm End: May 13, 2022 at 4:00 pm Location: JGB 4.102 (Barrow Family Conference Room) View Event The final doctoral examination for ANNA TURETCAIA has been scheduled for MAY 13; 2:00pm; JGB 4.102 (Barrow Family Conference Room) AND VIRTUAL..

But trapped in these glittering crystals are tiny droplets of water that have preserved what rain and snow were like thousands of years ago. Dr. Isabel Montañez shares her fascinating research in creating a timeline for Northern California’s climate history going back nearly 20,000 years. Isabel Montañez is a paleoclimatologist whose research focuses on reconstructing past climates, in particular those during major warming periods. Dr. Montañez is a professor at the University of California, Davis. She has been president of the Geological Society of America and currently is the Director of the UC Davis Institute of the Environment. Time: 7:00 – 7:40 p.m. The event will be streamed live through our Facebook and YouTube channels and will include a Q&A session with Dr. Montañez! × JSG Graduation BreakfastStart: May 20, 2022 at 8:30 am End: May 20, 2022 at 11:00 am Location: Holland Student Center (JGB 2.102) Please join us for a breakfast for JSG students/ faculty/guests Jackson School of Geosciences, 2305 Speedway, Holland Family Center, JGB 2.102 × JSG GraduationStart: May 20, 2022 at 12:00 pm End: May 20, 2022 at 1:30 pm Location: Bass Concert Hall View Event Friday, May 20, 2022 – 12:00pm – 1:30pm Bass Concert Hall The Jackson School of Geosciences holds commencement ceremonies each May to honor the graduates and candidates of the entire academic year.
