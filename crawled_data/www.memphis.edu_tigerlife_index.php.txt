TigerLIFE (Tigers Learning Independence Fostering Education and Employment), is the largest and most ethnically diverse program for intellectually/developmentally disabled adults in the state of Tennessee. Founded in January 2013, TigerLIFE operates under the Institute of Disability in the College of Education at the University of Memphis. We offer a diverse curriculum designed to help young adults succeed in obtaining and maintaining employment, and live independently as citizens of the Memphis/Shelby community. With support from several stakeholders, our goal is to guide our students down the path to employment and help them become integrated in the working world alongside their non-disabled peers.
