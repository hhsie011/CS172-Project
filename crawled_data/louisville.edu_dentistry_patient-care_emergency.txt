These are the top five dental emergencies: Toothache with no visible swelling Dental abscess (pain, swelling or draining infection) Dental trauma (fractured, displaced or avulsed teeth) Fractured tooth/lost filling/loss of a crown Damaged dental prosthesis (denture fractured/ veneer fractured/ orthodontic wire or appliance issue) What to do when a dental emergency occurs If you have an established relationship with a dentist If you don't have an established relationship with a dentist If you have a dental emergency, it is best to call your dentist and discuss the situation over the phone. It can be determined if you need to be seen immediately or if the care can wait until the office is open during regular hours. If you would like to be evaluated in the emergency clinic at the University of Louisville School of Dentistry, call 502-852-5096. Please note that we have a limited number of same-day and next-day emergency appointments available. Dental emergencies can also be seen in local hospital emergency rooms, but generally only very limited care can be provided.
