Medicare Part A and B is your primary medical insurance coverage once you retire from Columbia on or after age 65; Columbia University's Retiree Medical Plan will be your secondary coverage. Expand all Collapse all Medicare Part A - Hospital Insurance In most cases, Part A is free, as you paid for it through your FICA taxes while employed. Part A helps cover inpatient care in hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, hospice and home healthcare. At least three months prior to your 65th birthday or your retirement date from Columbia University, if after age 65, you and your spouse/same-sex domestic partner should contact the Social Security Administration to enroll in Part A. Part B - Medical Insurance Part B helps cover doctors and other healthcare providers, outpatient care, durable medical equipment and home healthcare. Some preventive services are covered to help maintain your health and to keep certain illnesses from getting worse.| Each individual is responsible for paying a monthly premium for Medicare Part B. You will also be responsible for an annual deductible. In order for a retiree and spouse/partner to enroll in any of the retiree medical plan options with Columbia, they must enroll in Part A & B once they reach age 65, or on your retirement date from Columbia University, if after age 65. Part C- Medicare Advantange Plans Medicare also sponsors approved private insurance companies, similar to the UnitedHealthcare Group Medicare Advantage Plan (HMO) or the Aetna Medicare PPO Plan that Columbia offers. Download Summary Plan Benefits and enrollment forms for the two Medicare Advantage plans offered by Columbia University to retired Officers or contact the Benefits Service Center at [email protected]. Part D - Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage This contributory prescription drug coverage is available on a voluntary basis to anyone who is eligible for Medicare. You will not be penalized as long as you have other creditable prescription drug coverage and do not incur a 63-day break in coverage. The OptumRx plan under the Indemnity and Choice Plus 100 Columbia Retiree Medical plans for Officers are on average at least equivalent to this coverage, therefore you are not required to enroll in Medicare Part D. 2018 Creditable Coverage Disclosure Notice For more information go to cms.gov or call 1-800-MEDICARE.
