Brown University is committed to supporting graduate students with children and strives to provide resources and support necessary to help graduate student parents thrive in their time at Brown. These pages feature Brown University resources and community resources that may be helpful starting points whether you are expecting, already have children, or are considering starting a family while at Brown. We encourage graduate students to explore the resources on these pages, at Brown and in the community, to determine best options for care, for education, for community activities and support for their children. We recommend graduate student parents connect with other graduate student parents at Brown through various channels (listserv, Facebook group, grad student parent events) to gain additional recommendations, advice and insight on additional resources. Finally, we welcome graduate students to reach out to the Graduate School with questions regarding policies, advocacy and opportunities for community support.
