Because of their close proximity to campus, these Forests are extensively used for university instruction and research. Managers apply several silvicultural themes - even-aged, two-aged, and multi-aged (plus mature forest reserves) across the entire McDonald and Dunn Forests, depending on specific objectives for each area. The Forest's recreation opportunities in close proximity to the Corvallis community result in over 155,000 non-motorized recreation visits each year. Peavy Arboretum serves as a gateway to the Forests and displays a diverse array of tree species. The Research Forests Business Office is located at Peavy Arboretum.
