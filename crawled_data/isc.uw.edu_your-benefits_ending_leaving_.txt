On This Page: Medical and Dental Insurance Savings Accounts (FSA/DCAP) Other Insurance Retirement Plans Regaining Benefits Eligibility Medical and Dental Insurance Your medical and dental coverage generally ends on the last day of the month you leave the University, as long as you were in an eligible pay status for at least eight (8) hours during that month.* If you are transferring from the UW to another Washington state agency, please work with them to arrange the transfer of your medical and dental coverage. If you are in need of documentation proving your loss of coverage, please contact the ISC. About Continuing Coverage/COBRA You may elect to purchase continued coverage through Public Employees Benefits Board (PEBB) Continuing Coverage/COBRA. The Washington State Health Care Authority (HCA) will mail a “PEBB Continuation Coverage Election Notice” to your home address after your coverage ends detailing your options based on your particular circumstances. It’s important to review this information carefully and postmark the completed election form by the deadline – usually no later than 60 calendar days following the date coverage ends. To learn more, please visit the HCA’s PEBB Continuation Coverage (COBRA) page. As an alternative to COBRA, you may qualify to purchase coverage through the Washington Health Insurance Marketplace or Washington Apple Health. Please visit Washington Health Plan Finder, Healthcare.Gov or call 1-800-200-1004 to learn more. Please note: Delays in your department’s processing of your separation from the University will in turn cause a processing delay at the HCA. *If you return to UW employment within the calendar month that follows the month in which you left your prior position, your PEBB benefits may be reinstated if specific criteria are met. Savings Accounts Dependent Care Assistance Program (DCAP) Your coverage automatically ends on the last day of the month you leave the University. You can continue to submit claims incurred before/on your coverage end date through the following March 31, though exceptions do apply. Please review the plan booklet (PDF) or contact Navia Benefit Services directly at 800-669-3539 with questions. Medical Flexible Spending Arrangement (FSA) or Limited Purpose FSA Your coverage automatically ends on the last day of the month you leave the University. You can continue to submit claims incurred before/on your coverage end date through the following March 31. You may choose to continue your Medical FSA or Limited Purpose FSA coverage for the remainder of the plan year (through December 31). Look for a COBRA notice from Navia Benefit Solutions or contact them at 1-800-669-3539. For information about accelerating your deductions, please contact the ISC. Other Insurance Basic Life insurance Your coverage automatically ends on the last day of the month you leave the University. If you are eligible for portability or conversion of your life insurance after separation, MetLife will send you information and an application. When porting or converting your employee life insurance coverage, your coverage will become an individual policy that is not tied to the PEBB program. Contact MetLife directly at 1-866-548-7139 with any questions. Optional Life Insurance Your coverage automatically ends on the last day of the pay period in which your premium was deducted from your paycheck. You have 60 days following the date you lose coverage to transfer your Optional Life insurance to your spouse or state-registered domestic partner’s PEBB account (if they’re also covered by PEBB), continue some/all of your life insurance through the portability option, or convert some/all of your life insurance into an individual policy. MetLife will mail you a letter approximately five to six weeks after your separation date, including information about your options. Contact MetLife directly at 1-866-548-7139 with any questions. Long Term Disability (LTD) Insurance Your Employer-Paid LTD insurance (i.e., contributions the University makes) automatically ends on the last day of the month you leave the University. Your Employee-Paid LTD insurance (i.e., contributions you make) automatically ends on the last day of the pay period in which your premium was deducted from your paycheck. Auto/Home Insurance (with Liberty Mutual) You can arrange to have coverage continue beyond your separation date. Contact Liberty Mutual at 800-706-5525 or via their website. Retirement Plans Your retirement plan options can depend on a variety of factors, such as your age, how long you’ve been participating, your retirement plan’s rules, and federal and state requirements. In general, there is no deadline to take any action on your retirement account and, depending on your own circumstances, you may leave your contributions in your plan, take a distribution, or elect to roll your retirement assets over into another qualified plan. We recommend consulting with your tax or financial advisor to determine what option makes sense for you. You may also contact your retirement plan directly: For UWRP and VIP plans Contact Fidelity Investments at 1-800-642-7131 or on the web. Or schedule a meeting with TIAA at 1-877-209-3142 or on the web. For PERS 2, PERS 3, TRS or LEOFF plans Contact the Washington Department of Retirement Systems at 800-547-6657 or on the web. Please note: if you intend to return to a benefits-eligible position at the UW or another state agency, you may wish to leave your retirement plan contributions in place. Regaining Benefits Eligibility Please know that the ISC monitors your employment across all UW departments and schools and will notify you if your eligibility to contribute to a health or retirement plan changes again in the future (for example: if you return to work at the UW or if your position regains eligibility).

Please be sure to also check with your department about any additional action items they may have related to your leaving the UW.
