The program develops a student’s knowledge of global history, culture, and contemporary political and economic issues. The requirements for the international affairs major allow students to pursue a variety of distinct interests that align with a student’s personal and professional goals. Employment opportunities are to be found in government service, international organizations (public, private, or non-profit), business, journalism, and teaching. Computer Skills Competency All undergraduates at Florida State University must demonstrate basic computer skills competency prior to graduation. As necessary computer competency skills vary from discipline to discipline, each major determines the courses needed to satisfy this requirement. Undergraduate majors in international affairs satisfy this requirement by earning a grade of “C–” or higher in any course at FSU which meets the liberal studies computer competency designation, though it is strongly recommended that students take either CGS 2060 or CGS 2100 in order to satisfy this requirement. Requirements for a Major in International Affairs Majors in international affairs must complete a minimum of thirty-nine semester hours beyond liberal studies requirements or the A.A. degree, with a grade of “C–” or better in each course. A minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 in all coursework applied to the major must be maintained. All courses counted toward the international affairs major must come from the approved list of courses in the participating and non-participating departments provided by the International Affairs program each semester. These term course lists are available in the program office in 211 Bellamy, the advising office in 106 Bellamy, and on the International Studies Canvas site. A master list of approved courses (excluding approved Special Topics courses) in the participating departments is provided below. Coursework must be selected from at least three participating departments and must include the required core courses INS 2010 (Professional Development for International Affairs Majors) as well as INS 3003 (Introduction to International Affairs). INS 3003 meets the university requirement for upper-division writing (https://liberalstudies.fsu.edu/). A minimum of twelve semester hours and a maximum of eighteen semester hours must be in one of the participating departments for a departmental concentration. No more than eighteen credit hours may be taken in one department. At least eighteen semester hours must be above the 2999 level. A maximum combined total of twelve semester hours in internship (INR 4941 or INS 4940), directed individual study (INR 4905), or upper-division honors in the major (INR 4937) may be credited to the major. Majors must also complete the University computer skills competency requirement (see above) and language requirement (see below). Students are advised to coordinate their coursework with foreign language study, focusing on a regional concentration (e.g., Africa, the Middle East, East or South Asia, Russia, Eastern and Central Europe, Western Europe, or Latin America). Majors are encouraged to include such courses as CPO 2002, INR 2002, ECO 2013 and 2023, GEA 1000, and WOH 1030 among the courses they take to fulfill the liberal studies requirements (if those courses are taken to fulfill the liberal studies requirements, however, they cannot also be counted toward the major requirements). In addition to a 2.0 overall GPA all students must meet “mapping” requirements. See https://www.academic-guide.fsu.edu/ for more information. Language Requirement While Students may choose to obtain either a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree or a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree, in both cases they must complete modern foreign language coursework to the intermediate level (2220 or equivalent course) or demonstrate intermediate proficiency in reading, writing, and speaking a modern foreign language. Any credit hours taken to meet this requirement do not count towards the 39 credit hours required to complete the major. Study Abroad Students majoring in international affairs are strongly encouraged to study abroad either through FSU International Programs (https://international.fsu.edu) or the Center for Global Engagement (https://cge.fsu.edu). Students are able to earn academic credit towards the international affairs major at a variety of international destinations. Students should consult with their academic advisor about any study abroad programs they wish to pursue. Coursework taken abroad must be approved in advance for credit toward the major. Internship The Program in International Affairs encourages students to take advantage of internships at the state, national, and international level. There are opportunities to work in the international arena through agencies and businesses in Florida’s capital, the Washington Center Program in Washington, DC., and Florida State’s International Programs in Valencia, Panama, and London. Most significantly, international affairs students can apply for one of the several prestigious internships in London, where we place our students in Parliament, the American Embassy, Amnesty International, NBC, the Associated Press, the British-American Chamber of Commerce, and other significant organizations, or in Panama where the United Nations has a regional office. Information and application materials are available on the International Studies Canvas site. Applications must be submitted and all internships must be approved the semester before the internship takes place. If approved, the student will be enrolled in INR 4941: Internship, which meets the university’s formative experience requirement (https://liberalstudies.fsu.edu). See the International Affairs program advisor in 211 Bellamy for further information. Honors in the Major The Program in International Affairs offers honors in the major (INR 4937) to encourage talented students to undertake independent research. For requirements and other information, see the “University Honors Office and Honor Societies” chapter of this General Bulletin. Second Majors When students pursue a second major, they may count six semester hours of coursework toward both of their majors. Otherwise, all major requirements are listed above. Requirements for a Minor in International Affairs A minor consists of eighteen semester hours beyond the liberal studies requirements (or courses used to satisfy general education requirements for an A.A. degree) with grades of “C–” or better. Work must be taken in at least three participating departments, and all of those courses must be from the approved list of courses below or terms lists provided by the program. Modern language courses numbered above 2999 may count toward the minor. Nine of the eighteen semester hours must be numbered above 2999. A maximum combined total of six semester hours in internship or directed individual study may apply to the minor. Approved Courses Descriptions of individual courses can be found under the departments in which they are taught. It is the student’s responsibility to verify course pre-requisite requirements at https://registrar.fsu.edu/bulletin/undergraduate. Note: In addition to the courses listed below, special topics courses may be approved by the program director in any particular term. These courses appear on the term course lists and are available in the program office in 211 Bellamy, the advising office in 106 Bellamy, and on the International Studies Canvas site.
