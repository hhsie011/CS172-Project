All courses must be passed with a “C” (2.0) or better. Those seeking careers in the health professions should speak to a health professions adviser about specific course recommendations. For more information, visit: fullerton.edu/health_professions.

The upper-division program requires at least six units of laboratory- or field-based activities, six units of 400-level biology courses and two units of a specified capstone course. Students with junior or senior standing will be permitted to enroll in BIOL 480 , BIOL 482 , BIOL 495 , BIOL 498 and BIOL 499L . However, no more than a combined total of six units of BIOL 480 (2 units maximum), BIOL 482 (2 units maximum), BIOL 495 (3 units maximum), BIOL 498 (2 units maximum) and BIOL 499L (6 units maximum) shall be counted toward the 21 upper-division biology units required for the major, and no more than three of these units may count toward the requirement to complete at least six units of upper-division biology laboratory/field electives.

Additional Information 1 courses that count as electives or capstone, but not both 2 a maximum of 4 units of these marine biology courses may be applied toward the 21 upper-division electives required for the EEB concentration Physiology One course in physiology is required. This can be met by taking one of the following as a Free Upper-Division Biology Elective or as part of the concentration if one of the courses below is listed as an option to fulfill a concentration requirement. BIOL 362 - Mammalian Physiology (4) BIOL 444 - Plant Physiological Ecology (4) BIOL 445 - Plant Cell Physiology (3) BIOL 468 - Comparative Animal Physiology (4) Free Upper-Division Biology Electives Although it is recommended that Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Concentration majors select additional elective units from courses listed under the Concentration Requirements, any upper-division biology majors course may be utilized to complete the 21 units of required upper-division courses.
