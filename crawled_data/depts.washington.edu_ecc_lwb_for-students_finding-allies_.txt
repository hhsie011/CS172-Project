This is why at the LWB Office we work to connect undocumented students with allies across campus who can provide them with additional support and resources. We know how important it is for undocumented students to know there are faculty and staff who are knowledgeable on undocumented student issues and who are ready and willing to support them. At the University of Washington, undocumented students can expect to find allies across our campus who can support and help them access a variety of resources and information. Connecting with Allies LWB works to provide training to staff and faculty who are interested in becoming allies to undocumented students and enhancing their working knowledge on how to best serve undocumented student populations. We invite you to explore how you can connect with allies at the University of Washington. Visit the LWB Office: Contact us at undocu@uw.edu or visit us on the third floor of the Kelly Ethnic Cultural Center located on 3931 Brooklyn Avenue NE Seattle, Washington 98105. Attend Purple Group Meetings: Faculty and staff who are allies to undocumented students are welcome to present or attend Purple Group meetings. Sign up to participate in an Undocu Ally Training: You can work with LWB Staff to attend or present at a LWB Undocu Ally training. This is not only a good leadership opportunity, but a great way to connect with allies from across campus. Contact us at undocu@uw.edu for more information.

Hall leads the university’s equity, diversity and inclusion efforts, and plays a key role in advancing institutional excellence. He has oversight of the UW Office of Minority Affairs & Diversity (OMA&D) which administers programs that broaden college access, support student success and enhance diversity-related teaching and learning across campus.

Prior to that role, he served for six years as the assistant vice president for equity and diversity at the University of Minnesota. Hall was awarded the 2015 Unity in the Community Award from HoLa Hora Latina (Knoxville, Tenn.) and selected as an American College Personnel Association Educational Leadership Foundation 2015 Diamond Honoree.

Hall is currently completing a doctor of education degree in organizational leadership at the University of Minnesota. CLOSE Carolina Valdivia Ordorica, Doctoral Candidate Creator of My Undocumented Life Carolina Valdivia is a doctoral candidate in Education at Harvard University. She is a recipient of the Ford Foundation Pre-Doctoral Fellowship. Her research interests include immigration, law and society, race and ethnicity, and social movements. Her work explores the ways through which illegality impacts the lives of immigrant youth and their families, including their educational trajectories and political participation. Her current project explores how deportation and its omnipresent threat shape the life trajectories of immigrant young adults. Title: Understanding the Educational Experiences of Undocumented Students and Identifying Ways to Support Them Drawing from existing research and her own personal journey as an undocumented student, Carolina will present on the experiences of undocumented students, including the challenges they face in high school and college. We will pay particular attention to how these challenges are exacerbated by the current political climate. Attendees will also learn about the different steps they can take to support undocumented students. CLOSE Dr. Laura Emiko Soltis Professor and Executive Director, Freedom University Professor Soltis received her bachelor’s degree from the University of Georgia, where she was awarded the Foundation Fellowship. Emiko received her PhD from Emory University and wrote her dissertation on the role of global human rights strategies and local music practices in the mobilization of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, an interracial farmworker organization in South Florida. Her research and teaching interests include social movement theory, global studies, music and social movements, U.S. immigration history, and racial formation theory. Having served as a longtime student activist, Emiko is committed to mentoring undocumented youth and providing them with the knowledge and skills they need to be effective leaders in their own freedom struggle. Title: Good Trouble: Liberatory Education, Direct Action, and the Undocumented Student Movement in Georgia Dr. Laura Emiko Soltis will share her experience as a teacher at Freedom University, an underground freedom school for undocumented students in Georgia. She will discuss the rise of anti-immigrant policies in the Deep South from a racial and economic justice perspective, and describe how Freedom University has resisted such policies by utilizing a liberatory education model and human rights framework in the classroom, and a multi-level strategy of intersectional coalition building, direct actions, and federal legal challenges in the public arena. Most importantly, Soltis will share what she has learned as a teacher of undocumented students and present a photographic history of their fight against modern segregation in one of the most hostile states in the country. CLOSE Supporting A Diverse Community: Undocumented Asians & Pacific Islanders Presenters: Marissa Vichayapai, Programs Director of 21 Progress & Organizing Director of FAIR! Michel Baños, Candidate for the Bachelor’s degree in University of Washington In Washington State, Asians and Pacific Islanders (API) make up 26% of the undocumented community, yet APIs have the lowest application rates to federal programs that offer protection and access to resources. Facing their own unique challenges, the underserved community of APIs who are undocumented fight to gain visibility and access to the resources they need. Fearless Asians for Immigration Reform (FAIR!), a campaign of 21 Progress, was the first in WA State to organize on undocu API issues. Since it’s launch in 2014, the campaign has reached over 20,000 members in the API community through advocacy trainings, cultural ambassadors, social media campaigns, and grassroots activism. In this workshop you’ll learn about the trends, stories, and needs of the undocumented API community, best practices from the field, and ways you can create change and equity within your community. Join us to discover how you can use your power to be a transformational ally to undocumented APIs in this interactive and informative workshop. CLOSE M.
