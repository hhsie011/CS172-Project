For further information, go to our webpage: Home Office Ergonomics The simplest definition of ergonomics is fitting the job to the worker. The goal of ergonomics is to enhance the worker's comfort, health and productivity. If ergonomics is not considered when designing a job or workstation, injuries can occur. Ergonomic-related injuries are observed in the office environment, laboratories and material handling jobs. The goal of this web page is to provide guidelines to improve a workstation or job to prevent injuries from occurring. Computer Ergonomics Office ergonomic assessments are now available remotely using our new software, Humantech Office Ergonomics! Go here to learn more: Humantech Office Ergonomics If you have questions regarding computer ergonomics please refer to the self-help information provided on the EHRS web page or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration web page.
