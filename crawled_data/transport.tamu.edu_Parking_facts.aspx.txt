As of the beginning of FY2016 there are 37,330 parking spaces distributed over 151 parking lots and five parking garages. Parking Lots and Spaces chart Permit Data garage permit counts and counts by class How many areas can students park in? There are 55 lots and 5 garages. Some areas are more than one lot (es. lot 100 has 11 lots). There are 21,928 spaces available for student purchase. How many disabled parking spaces are on campus? Disabled spaces are calculated using ADA rules. ADA rules say that each lot is required to follow the chart, however we have several lots that are remote from any buildings, thus we adjust by over-allocating disabled spaces in some lots closer to buildings. For example, lot 35, the disabled spaces on Asbury and Spence and lot 102. We have almost 900 disabled spaces on campus. How many timed spaces are on campus? 524 What is the average parking spot width? 9 feet What is the history of permit prices at Texas A&M University? See Permit Price History How do A&M University parking permit rates compare to other large universities? See Parking Rates How many parking services officers are on-duty at one time? Approximately 15-18 officers regulate parking per shift, and there are 2 shifts per day. How do parking services officers determine which area to monitor at what time? The campus is divided up into a grid, and each officer is assigned a section of the grid. How are the 30 minute parking areas monitored, and how often are they checked? Each officer is responsible for the 30 minute parking area in his or her section of the campus grid. When parking areas are checked initially, the officer enters the information about the vehicles parked in the area into a handheld unit. After about 30-40 minutes have elapsed, the officer returns to the parking area and re-enters information about the vehicles in the parking area into the handheld unit, which indicates which ones are in violation of the area's time limit. The order in which the officer visits the parking areas in his or her section of the campus grid is left to the officer's discretion.
