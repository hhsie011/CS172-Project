Italian Poetry Review (IPR) is a journal of creativity and criticism that is part of a larger cultural program based at Columbia, both in the Italian Department and at the Italian Academy for Advanced Studies in America. Printed mostly in Italian and English, IPR is the first journal in the United States dedicated to the critical and pluri-lingual diffusion of Italian poetry in a broad comparative context: it compares the current state of Italian and American poetry, and fosters a dialogue between poetry and prose as well as a dialogue between poetry and “texts” from non-verbal arts, such as painting, sculpture, architecture, photography, and design. IPR aims at establishing a dialogue between academic and non-academic readers of poetry. The presentation of the 2008 issue of the review will include a poetry reading, in English and Italian, accompanied by a round table. Poetry readings by Alfredo De Palchi (Director of “Chelsea Publications”), Pulitzer Prize winner Richard Howard (Columbia U.), Davide Rondoni(Director of the Center for Contemporary Poetry, Bologna), former MacArthur Fellow Susan Stewart (Princeton U.), Poet Laureate of the United States, Mark Strand (Columbia U.). Translation readings by Graziella Sidoli (Convent of the Sacred Heart).
