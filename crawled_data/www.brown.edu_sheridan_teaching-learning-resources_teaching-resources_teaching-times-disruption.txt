Asynchronous Strategies for Inclusive Teaching For equity and accessibility, Brown instructors were asked to prioritize asynchronous instruction in Spring 2020. The hallmark of asynchronous learning activities is that students do not participate at the same time. This resource provides strategies for asynchronous course design and examples of concrete activities and assignments. Teaching and Learning Guides These Digital Learning and Design resources suggest ways to use digital tools like Google, Panopto, Zoom, and Canvas to maintain key teaching and learning functions.
