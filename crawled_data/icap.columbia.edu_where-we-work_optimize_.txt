Limited funding and country budgets call for a simpler, safer, more cost-effective approach to HIV treatment. That’s why ICAP is part of the OPTIMIZE project, a global consortium dedicated to rapidly improving treatment outcomes for people living with HIV by optimizing ARV drugs and formulations and accelerating their introduction in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). OPTIMIZE is supported by USAID and led by the Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute (Wits RHI) and founding members including ICAP‚ Mylan Laboratories‚ the University of Liverpool, and the UNITAID-funded Medicines Patent Pool.
