In the 2021-22 academic year, undergraduates received more than $173 million of financial aid in the form of endowment-generated, need-based scholarships that do not require repayment. Nearly 70 percent of students received some type of financial aid. The median need-based scholarship offered to freshmen including University, Federal Pell, and supplemental grants was $50,550. Almost 100% percent of students in the Graduate School—both doctoral and non-professional master’s— receive full-tuition scholarships that include all fees except for a small student activity fee. Financial Aid Budget, Endowment, and Income Notre Dame’s operating budget for the fiscal year 2021–22 is $1.5 billion, and the market value of its endowment is approximately $13.3 billion. Two major sources of revenue accounting for just about 60 percent of the total are student tuition and fees, and auxiliary enterprises (including residence halls, dining facilities, athletics and the bookstore).
