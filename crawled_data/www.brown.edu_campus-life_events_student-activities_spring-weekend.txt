You can view the schedule by following the link here. Information about individual events will be forthcoming and will be sent out this week and next week. Please reach out to Matt Branch at [email protected] if you have any questions. Ticketing Information: On Monday, April 25th at 8:00 am, 3000 tickets will be available to Brown students. Each student can reserve one ticket per day. The Spring Weekend concerts are free but tickets are required and we will likely hit capacity, so reserving is a must! On Wednesday, April 27th at 2:00 pm, if the weather call is made that we will have the concert outdoors, an additional 2500 tickets per day will go on sale. Any Brown students who did not reserve their tickets on Monday will have the opportunity to reserve one ticket per show. Tickets will be available until we reach capacity. Remember, tickets are non-refundable, non-transferable, and only open to Brown students. Tickets are limited to current Brown students only and are non-transferable. A physical Brown ID (no copies or photos) is required for entry. The name on your ticket must match your ID. How to reserve tickets: Reserve tickets on the Brown Ticketing website here: https://tickets.brown.edu/springweekend Go to the link above Login via the Shibboleth portal Add a ticket from each date to your cart if you plan on going to both dates (just add one of the days if you are only planning to attend one) Proceed to checkout! Important: Prior to tickets going on sale, please be logged in to your Brown account before attempting to purchase Spring Weekend tickets. You will be required to log in with Brown credentials so make sure to test your access before Monday Morning! Text #SPRING22 to 1-855-799-2180 to receive messages and updates about Spring Weekend. This is a new service we're trying for Spring Weekend 2022 and messages will begin on 4/24. Information on 4/45 Ticketing issue: Due to a higher than anticipated volume of traffic to the Ticketing website on Monday at 8am, the servers reached capacity resulting in error messages for many users. Our vendor was able to add additional server capacity and we believe the issue was resolved. Should we release more tickets on Wednesday we are confident that the additional server capacity will be more than sufficient to handle the volume of traffic and do not anticipate any issues. We apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. Please reach out to [email protected] if you have any questions.
