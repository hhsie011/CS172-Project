Students may purchase only one automobile permit and one motorcycle/moped permit per year. Parking permits are registered to your license plate, instead of a window sticker. Please know your license plate before you begin the permit purchase process. You can register alternate license plates if drive a different vehicle. Only one registered vehicle can be parked on campus at a time. Annual student permits will be available to order online through the KU Parking portal beginning July 6. Students will be offered permits in order by class*: Graduate and professional students (July 6) Seniors (July 12) Juniors (July 19) Sophomores (July 26) Freshmen and all university housing (Aug 2) You must be enrolled in order to purchase a parking permit. Typically, this means that new students cannot buy their permits until at least 24 hours after their orientation visit. Annual permits are valid August 1-July 31. If you need a permit for one semester only, purchase the annual permit and contact KU Transportation Services after finals week to cancel your permit if it is no longer needed. Students who cancel the permit will only be able to repurchase a Park & Ride permit for the remainder of the current academic year. Night-and-Weekend Garage Pass Students with a valid KU parking permit can purchase a pass for $5 that allows parking in either the Mississippi Street Garage, the Allen Fieldhouse Garage or the Central District Garage after 5 p.m. and before 7 a.m. Monday-Friday, and any time on weekends. A pass is valid only for the specified garage, and is not valid when the garage is reserved for KU home football or basketball games. Cars must be moved prior to the date/time indicated on temporary signs posted at garage entrances at least 48 hours prior to game days.
