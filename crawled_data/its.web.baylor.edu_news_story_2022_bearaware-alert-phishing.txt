Upon investigation, the point of entry for these messages was someone approving a DUO notification that they did not initiate which resulted in their email account being compromised. DUO two-factor authentication provides a barrier of protection for the university against phishing attacks and other outside access to Baylor information systems. Only approve DUO pushes, phone calls, and use tokens that you know you have requested. Assuming it is a legitimate request and approving will place your personal information, university information, and technology at risk of loss and compromise. If you did not initiate the DUO request click Deny which notifies Baylor cybersecurity staff of a possible compromise attempt that can be further investigated. If you receive an email that seems "phishy" — asks for an immediate response with personal information such as your social security number, credit card numbers, phone numbers, passwords, and other sensitive information) or contains unexpected attachments — delete it without responding or opening the attachments. You can also forward the emails to abuse@baylor.edu. If you have questions about whether an email you received is a phishing attempt, please visit HelpDesk+ on the garden level of Moody Memorial Library, call (254) 710-4357, or email helpdesk@baylor.edu.
