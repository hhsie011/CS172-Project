Guarini '46 Board of Advisors Factsheet Visual Identity From the Dean People Visiting Dartmouth Life & Community News & Events Share Frank J. Guarini '46 In 2018 Dartmouth announced it was naming its graduate school in honor of Frank J. Guarini ’46, a former congressman, delegate to NATO, and U.S. Representative to the United Nations, who has made a historic gift in support of the College’s graduate programs. Frank J. Guarini '46: Honoring a Visionary In May, 2018 Dartmouth announced the naming of the Frank J. Guarini School of Graduate and Advanced Studies in acknowledgement of a transformative investment in graduate education by the Honorable Frank J. Guarini '46. The first new school to be created in over a century at Dartmouth, the Guarini School supports more than 1,000 graduate students, doctoral candidates, and postdoctoral scholars – young men and women who will go out into the world and drive positive change, just as Congressman Guarini has. "Frank has led a remarkable life of service and dedication, and all of us at Dartmouth are inspired by his leadership," says President Phil Hanlon '77. "Frank has given selflessly to help others – from his service in World War II, when he received the Navy Commendation Medal and three Battle Stars, to seven terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, to his dedication to advancing international place." For nearly two generations, Frank Guarini has generously invested in the Dartmouth educational experience, making transformative gifts that have touched many lives, from establishing the Honorable Frank J. Guarini NIAF Italian Language Study Abroad program, which honors his family's vibrant heritage; to creating the Frank J. Guarini Institute for International Education, the Frank J. Guarini Associate Deanship for International Studies and Interdisciplinary Programs, and much more. His service as a New Jersey state senator, U.S. congressman, delegate to NATO, and representative to the UN reflects his deep understanding of the lifelong global impact of a Dartmouth education and its urgent mission to tackle the world's toughest problems. Now more than ever, the world needs leaders of this caliber, and the Guarini School of Graduate and Advanced Studies at Dartmouth is committed to producing them.
