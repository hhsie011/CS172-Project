"HSI" stands for "Hispanic-Serving Institution." It is a designation created by the U.S. Department of Education to identify and support institutions of higher education that provide post-secondary educational opportunities to Hispanic students. What does it take to be an HSI? The Department of Education requires two elements to become an HSI. An enrollment of undergraduate full-time equivalent students that is at least 25 percent Hispanic; and A determination that the institution is an "eligible institution" (i.e., has an enrollment of disadvantaged students and low average expenditures per student).
