Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) ADUHELM® Our center is aware of the approval, on June 7th, by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the medication aducanumab (brand name ADUHELM®) to treat Alzheimer’s disease (see FDA.gov). Aducanumab is the first drug approved in the United States, which removes Alzheimer’s disease proteins from the brain, and is designed to slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. We are waiting for more information on availability and eligibility for insurance coverage, including Medicare. This is an evolving situation which we are monitoring very closely, and we are working towards offering it here soon. You may schedule a visit with your doctor to discuss this drug with you. If you are a new patient, you will first need to schedule an initial evaluation and diagnostic testing to determine potential eligibility. Our Cores Led by some of the best minds in their field, specific projects cover a broad range of scientific disciplines, allowing the Columbia University ADRC to mobilize toward its goals in research and training.
