Who We Are The Cuban Heritage Collection at the University of Miami Libraries is home to the largest repository of materials on Cuba outside of the island and the most comprehensive collection of resources about Cuban exile history and the global Cuban diaspora experience. As a premier research destination, the Collection hosts researchers, students, and visitors from around the world who can explore and discover a wide and ever-expanding range of information. These materials include published works such as rare and contemporary books, journals, artists books, and newspapers, as well as archival materials including personal papers, organizational records, correspondence, manuscripts, photographs, maps, works on paper, audiovisual content, ephemera, and growing born-digital and digitized collections. The Collection organizes a calendar of events and programing and curates exhibitions that showcase the richness of the repository. The span of the University of Miami Libraries’ Cuban Heritage Collection reinforces the University’s hemispheric mission and commitment to a continuing relationship with its neighbors.
