Advertising Policy Consistent with University and State of Utah policy on the appropriate use of University-owned equipment, the university's Web page must not be used for commercial, non-mission-related purposes. In practice, this means that advertising space cannot be sold at any level of the Web page. "Advertising" refers to any situation in which the university or one of its units received payment or in-kind gifts in exchange for a link or brand placement on a university Web page. While advertising cannot be sold at any level, links to commercial vendors may be made in the following specific situations: Licensed software required for Web viewing - The logo or graphic represents licensed software on which a core function of the page is based (e.g., Netscape, Adobe Acrobat Reader, etc.) Links to separately contracted vendor - The logo or link is to a vendor or other entity separately contracted to provide services to the university Sponsorship Recognition - Within a unit's Web page, a logo or link can be displayed at that unit's second level page or below to acknowledge the support of the unit's mission-related activities through sponsorship. Such logos or links are deemed to be recognition of corporate or other external sponsorship; payment may not be accepted for that link or logo Educational purposes - The text link provides information for educational or other mission-related purposes and the university has received no consideration for incorporating that link To learn more about copyright at USU, visit the website about Copyright Essentials for Faculty, Staff, and Students.
