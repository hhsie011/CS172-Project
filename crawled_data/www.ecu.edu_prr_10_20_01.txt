Introduction The graduate catalog is offered online in a digital format. The current graduate catalog and archived graduate catalogs are accessible on the Office of the Registrar website at: www.ecu.edu/registrar/catalog.cfm. The graduate catalog is for informational purposes only and does not constitute a contractual agreement between a student and East Carolina University. The university reserves the right to make changes in curricula, degree requirements, course offerings, or academic regulations at any time when, in the judgment of the faculty, the Chancellor, or the Board of Trustees, such changes are in the best interest of the students and the university. Ordinarily, a student may expect to earn a degree in accordance with the requirements of the curriculum described in the official graduate catalog in effect when he or she first entered the university or in any subsequent catalog published while he or she is a student, but the faculty of the university reserves the right to make changes in curricula and in regulations at any time when in its judgment such changes are for the best interest of the students and of the university. Graduate students should refer to the requirements of their respective college, school, or department for information about their programs of study and confer with their advisors whenever problems arise. 1.1.
