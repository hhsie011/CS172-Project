Membership is open to all alumni varsity letter winners and members of the Princeton Athletics Friends Groups, and also open to all alumni and supporters of Princeton University who are interested in helping further the mission of the Princeton Varsity Club. All gifts to the PVC are fully tax-deductible and benefit nearly 1,000 varsity student-athletes across 37 varsity athletic programs. The PVC supports the notion that athletics are an integral part of the educational mission of the University and that Princeton Athletics should aspire to be a model for collegiate athletics, both in the Ivy League and in the NCAA at large. The PVC also supports the ongoing role athletics and the student-athlete play within the University community. Learn More Athletics Friends Groups The Department of Athletics and coaches rely on the financial support of their Athletics Friends Group for continued success in their programs. The mission of AFGs is to secure philanthropic and volunteer support that enables coaches to recruit and develop some of the finest scholar-athletes in the world, and to provide our student-athletes with the best possible overall experience. Princeton’s Athletics Friends Groups raise money to support a wide range of needs and opportunities for each of the 37 varsity athletic teams and the 37 club sport teams. Currently, there are 17 varsity Athletics Friends Groups (one AFG supports men’s and women’s teams of the same sport, such as basketball). Each varsity Athletics Friends Group has at least one volunteer president, and in some cases, other volunteer board members to assist the president(s) in carrying out activities of the group. Athletics Friends Groups provide many opportunities to reconnect with former teammates and meet alumni from all decades. Friends are invited to events such as alumni days, fundraising dinners, milestone anniversaries, on-the-road gatherings, “Meet the Coach” events, mentoring sessions, and networking nights. We encourage all Princeton alumni letter winners/participants, parents of student-athletes, parents of alumni, and friends of Princeton Athletics to become involved with the Athletics Friends Groups.
