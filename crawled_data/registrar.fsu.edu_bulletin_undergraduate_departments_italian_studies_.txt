Pitts (International Programs) The Florence Study Center minor is focused on the culture of Italy from ancient times to the present. The minor is built around the student’s program of studies at the Florida State University Florence Study Center, allowing the student to pursue the minor before, during, and after the student attends the Florence program. The minor gives greater focus to, and enhances the quality of, the student’s program of studies in Italy. The sojourn in Florence is the essential element in the minor, providing direct involvement in contemporary Italian civilization as well as exposure to Italy’s historical cultural artifacts. Requirements for a Minor in Florence Study Center Interdisciplinary Studies The interdisciplinary minor requires the completion of fifteen semester hours in courses approved by the Florence Study Center Minor Coordinating Committee. At least nine semester hours of approved courses must be taken while the student is in residence at the Florence Study Center. A maximum of nine semester hours may be counted in any single academic discipline. Students who intend to minor in Florence Study Center Interdisciplinary Studies should declare this intention with International Programs at the end of the semester in Florence. Contact Sarah Lovins Bacani at slovins@fsu.edu for further information. The student must have completed at least three semester hours (or the equivalent) in elementary Italian prior to attending the Florence Center.
