Additionally, there is an all-student group focused on campus culture, and a faculty group focused on campus as a living lab. The work of these working groups is reflected and incorporated into the strategies put forward to meet the goals within the six commitment areas in this plan. Throughout the ten-year period of the plan, these groups will continue to work together to achieve these strategies and will share progress along the way.
