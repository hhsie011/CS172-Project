Linguistics is also concerned with the relationship between language and cognition, society, and history. The Department of Linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania is the oldest modern linguistics department in the United States, founded by Zellig Harris in 1947. The department is known for its interdisciplinary research, spanning many subfields of linguistics, as well as integration of theory, corpus research, field work, and cognitive and computer science. The department has both a graduate Ph.D. program and undergraduate major and minors. For the specializations of our faculty, please see the research section.
