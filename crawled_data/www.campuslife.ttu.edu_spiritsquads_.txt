The Spirit Squads lead the fans in supporting the teams at football, basketball, and volleyball games. They serve as ambassadors not only at athletic events, but also at many different school and community functions. In additional to our game day role, the members represent Texas Tech on the national stage at competitions. Being a proud part of the Texas Tech Spirit Program is more than just a year-round commitment. It means dedication from each member to maintain the school spirit of the students, the alumni, and the fans. The Spirit Program members take pride in knowing that they are an essential part of such a wonderful tradition!
