Located in 211 Bellamy, we offer Asian Studies programs at both the undergraduate and graduate level. Our programs feature fields of study which may be individually tailored to fit each student’s unique career aspirations. In these programs, students also can intern and study abroad, furthering their experience with firsthand, real-world scenarios. The program in Asian Studies is an area studies program that is designed to develop a student’s competence in the language, history, culture and the contemporary political economic setting of a country or cultural region. The program is focused on Asia, broadly defined as including East Asia, South Asia and the Middle East. We help prepare students for international careers in the public and private sectors, such as positions in government, business, non-governmental and non-profit organizations, journalism, research and teaching. Additionally, each program may serve as a vehicle into a more specialized doctoral program, usually within one of the disciplines represented by the participating departments.
