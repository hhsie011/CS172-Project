We want to educate engineers and computer scientists who will graduate with state-of-the art knowledge in their chosen field and are ready to embark on careers in industry and government, or proceed to acquire advanced degrees in their own or related fields. More and more of our graduates are also interested in being entrepreneurs, thanks to the success of so many young people on the West Coast who have become successful in creating wealth via technology.” Dean Susamma Barua College of Engineering and Computer Science Associate Dean Sang June Oh Dean’s Office Computer Science 502 657-278-3362 College Website fullerton.edu/ecs The curricula of the College of Engineering and Computer Science are designed to prepare students for careers in engineering and computer science and for further study and specialization in graduate work. The faculty of the college is actively involved, not only in instruction and scholarship, but also in the advising of students on topics relating to the planning of career and program goals. Cooperative education and internship programs are generally available. ENGINEERING - UNDECLARED The Engineering - Undeclared option is designed for students who are interested in pursuing an engineering education, but are undecided on a particular major within the College of Engineering and Computer Science. The college’s Student Success Center advisers will provide academic advising, help students explore their academic interests and guide students through the process of selecting and declaring a major. Students admitted as Engineering - Undeclared must declare a major before the beginning of the third semester. The option is open only to freshmen applicants and is not open to transfer applicants. Transfer applicants must choose a specific major and should apply to that major. ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT Courses are designated as EGMT in the class schedule.
