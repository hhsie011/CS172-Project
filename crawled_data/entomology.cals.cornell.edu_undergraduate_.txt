Serving as excellent preparation for future endeavors, alumni of the program have gone on to medical school, veterinary school, graduate school, and work in government, agriculture and Integrated Pest Management (IPM). Whether your interest is systematics, genomics, medical entomology, IPM or physiology, we have opportunities for you! Undergraduate students can pursue studies in Entomology at Cornell in three ways: Major in Entomology: An excellent option for those who are sure they would like to pursue graduate studies or a career involving insect biology. This is a small major, which increases the interactions between students and faculty and their graduate students. Students study broadly across biology and other natural sciences, such as chemistry and physics, and deeply within the biology of insects. Biological Sciences Concentration in Insect Biology: Students must complete all the requirements for the Biological Sciences major, plus specialize in Entomology. Minor in Entomology: A good option for students in other CALS majors who have a casual interest in Entomology. Finally, students with a very serious interest in pursuing Entomological research should consider fulfilling the requirements for Distinction in Research Honors in Entomology. In this case, students work directly with a faculty member to complete an independent research project and submit an honors thesis by the end of their senior year. Why Entomology at Cornell? Cornell is a mid- to large-size university (relative to universities in New York). However, Entomology courses are typically small (15-35 students). This creates a highly personal environment that allows students and faculty to get to know each other well, and facilitates opportunities for all students to excel. Not only do students get hands-on experience in lab courses utilizing Cornell's vast array of specimens and the latest scientific equipment, but numerous opportunities exist for research with faculty members during the academic year and summer. Insectapalooza The annual, one-day insect fair hosted by the faculty, staff and students of the Department of Entomology at Cornell University. Insectapalooza is an interactive, hands-on experience that features hundreds of live insects, spiders, and other fascinating arthropods.
