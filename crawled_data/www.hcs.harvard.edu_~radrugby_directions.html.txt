Directions to the Pitch Take Mass Pike East to Exit 18 (should read "Allston/Cambridge"; it's a left exit). Go through the toll and follow signs to Cambridge. Pass through one set of lights and come to another set of lights immediately after crossing over the river. Turn left here (Memorial Drive; there's no sign, but there's a Shell Station). Continue to go straight on Mem Drive. Turn left at the second light (large boathouse on your left). Go over the river on North Harvard St. and on your right will be the athletic complex. Park on the street (you can try to park in the lot for the athletic complex, but we can't guarantee you won't be towed.) When you enter the complex, the football stadium is on your left and the indoor track/hockey rink is straight ahead. Our pitch is behind Jordan Field and the Beren Tennis Center (look for the uprights). This map shows the athletic facilities; the diagonal street in the lower right is North Harvard Street, which is what you took when you turned off of Mem Drive if you followed our directions correctly and probably where you parked. Our pitch is beyond the turf field and the tennis courts.
