The E2C approach integrates science domain knowledge with classroom learning and technology skills. Through weekend and summer workshops, K-14 teacher-participants participate in presentations by research scientists about their latest investigations while acquiring new background information and classroom-ready applications. The E2C website offers a variety of resources for teachers and their students, including one of the most comprehensive sets of Earth Science curriculum units anywhere, web-based student investigations, links to useful Internet pages, links to national and state curriculum standards, and other features. Since 1998, we have provided more than 120 workshops featuring over 80 LDEO scientists. Learn More Earth2Class Website Contact Michael J.
