The IT@UC Office of Information Security (OIS) is one of many entities that participates. OIS has held Information Security Awareness Week (ISAW) annually since 2009 to help promote the month and spread awareness to the university community so that UC may work towards a more secure future. This is now a month-long event. Each and every one of us needs to do our part to make sure that our online lives are kept safe and secure. That's what Cybersecurity Awareness Month - observed in October - is all about!
