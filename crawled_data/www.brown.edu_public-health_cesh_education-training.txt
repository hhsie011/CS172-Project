That’s why we created EvSynth Academy- a program devoted to bringing evidence synthesis out of academia and into our communities. Find our free, open access, easy-to-understand courses at Evsynthacademy.org.

Customized Workshops We frequently lead a basic "Introduction to Systematic Reviews" course, as well as more advanced courses in meta-analysis, network meta-analysis and risk of bias.
