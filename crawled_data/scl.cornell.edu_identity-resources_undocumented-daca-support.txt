"Cornell, since its founding, has been committed to diversity and inclusion, and DACA students are an integral part of our community. They were brought to this country before they had a choice in the matter, have grown up here, and are succeeding here despite significant challenges and obstacles. I believe they deserve a chance to fulfill their dreams..." â€”President Martha Pollack Meet the Team Julia Dahae Jun Graduate Assistant, Student Empowerment & Undocumented/DACA Student Support dj344@cornell.edu Julia was born in Seoul, South Korea, grew up in Queens, NY and graduated from Stony Brook University with a B.S. in Psychology.
