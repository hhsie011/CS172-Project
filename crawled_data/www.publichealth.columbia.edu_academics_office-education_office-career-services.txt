Career support continues for alumni throughout their professional careers. Field Practice We support the graduation-required Applied Practice Experience (APEx) for MPH, MHA and DrPH students through the practicum program. We can help you find an APEx site that aligns with your interests and goals, and help you complete the necessary paperwork to make it happen. We advise individual students and groups on these and other related issues, and offer pre-departure orientations for selected international field sites. Our unit supports other practice and professional opportunities such as volunteer, service-learning and interprofessional experiences for students across all departments and schools at Mailman. Are you looking for a field experience in a particular location, related to a specific health issue, or with a certain organization? Are you planning to travel to a location that is unstable due to political unrest or other risks? Are you interested in a practicum at one of the school-wide international sites or in an inter-professional service-learning opportunity?
