Most UCR faculty and students (including University Extension users) will use the CAS (Central Authentication Services) login. CAS authentication uses your UCR NetID and password. These are the same credentials you use when logging into your UCR e-mail account. If you are an iLearn Community user, you should use the "Community Users" section. Guest users should use the Guest Login. iLearn Community Instructors & Students Guest User Please enable JavaScript in your browser for the Blackboard application to function.
