This mentored scholar program includes a scholarship, which is awarded annually to ten Black/African American or Latinx high school graduates from Kentucky or Southern Indiana. MLK Scholars participate in a program designed to develop critical thinking skills, engage in self exploration, and establish an appreciation for civic engagement. MLK Scholars live in an Honors Service Living Learning community throughout their first year, enroll in courses focused on social justice and peace studies, engage in experiential learning through community service initiatives, and, during the second year, participate in a civil rights immersion travel experience. The program includes full in-state tuition plus an $8,000 stipend to cover other university expenses. A minimum high school GPA of 3.5 is required to apply. ACT/SAT scores are not considered. To Apply: Students who are eligible to apply for this scholarship will find their next steps in their UofL Application Gateway soon after they apply to UofL. The deadline to apply for this scholarship and submit materials is December 15. A complete application includes: One essay (700-1,000 words) responding to ONE of the following prompts: Social justice and community service are key elements of the MLK Scholars Program. What is your understanding of social justice and what significance does it hold for you? If you were given the opportunity as an MLK Scholar to develop and implement a social justice themed project, what would you be interested in pursuing for this project? Why? UofL is dedicated to becoming a premier anti-racist community. What does being an anti-racist institution mean to you? When evaluating this construct, how will you contribute to UofL’s anti-racist mission? 2 letters of recommendation (at least one must be from a high school teacher) Resume (review resume scoring rubric.)
