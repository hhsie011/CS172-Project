Most international students will find that it is easier and more practical to explore on campus housing or share an apartment than to try to obtain a lease in your name. Getting a lease without a U.S. credit history, employment, or a U.S.–based guarantor is very difficult.

Obtain a U.S. Credit Card It is difficult for newcomers to get your first credit card because of lack of U.S. credit history (record of paying your bills). Ask the bank where you have an account about qualifying for one of their credit cards to help establish a credit history. Get U.S. Mobile Phone Service Some carriers may offer student discounts, but it is best to check with the stores owned by the mobile provider directly rather than "authorized dealers." Some students bring an “unlocked” phone from home and buy a U.S. SIM card at a US airport, from a mobile provider, or a prepaid card online. There are many phone service provider stores in the Columbia neighborhoods. Some top providers are: AT&T, T Mobile, Sprint, Verizon.

When you arrange your course schedule, consult not only your academic adviser but also experienced students. Don't forget to have a full-time course load! Keep up with your assignments. Don't wait until the end of your term to begin studying! Talk with your instructors. Professors expect students to ask questions in or immediately after class, or during office hours. Know your professor's expectations. Each professor may have different expectations and requirements. Academic Integrity Academic integrity is taken seriously, and violations may have harsh consequences, including being expelled from the university. Be aware of plagiarism and cheating. Each school at Columbia has its own code of academic honesty and integrity and the way in which infractions are disciplined. What is considered cheating? Having someone else do your work. Talking during examinations, especially in another language. Asking to borrow a pencil or using another person’s calculator during an exam could even be construed as cheating. Collaborating on homework assignments. Be sure you ask the teaching assistant or the professor whether you can work with fellow students on an assignment. What is considered plagiarism? Plagiarism is defined as representing another person’s work as your own. To avoid plagiarism: Read Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS) Academic Integrity and Responsible Conduct of Research Use the Columbia University Libraries’ citation management software Learn to recognize plagiarism via this self-test tool.

Additional Personal Safety Tips At night, take the well-lit and well-traveled paths. Avoid shortcuts through dark or isolated areas. Don’t be afraid or embarrassed to utilize the Walking Safety Escort Program—your safety, well-being, and peace of mind are at stake. Be prepared and ready with your keys before you approach your residence hall, apartment, home, or automobile. If you think someone is following you, don’t lead him or her to your destination—instead, abruptly change directions and go into a store or restaurant that is open. Be aware of your valuables and belongings, such as your backpack, handbag, or wallet. Even if you’re in a “safe” place for a short time, take them with you rather than leave them behind. When taking the bus or subway, use well-lit, and preferably well-peopled, stations. Beware of Scams and Phishing Fraudulent phishing emails and imposter phone calls are a big problem. Scammers are very creative and skillful in seeking access to your money and/or personal information by either gaining your confidence (“con artist”) or threatening you. They pretend to be from a government agency and demand money for a variety of fake reasons, including taxes you owe or a problem with your immigration status. The best way to avoid being a victim of a scam is to be aware that they exist and have some common characteristics: Always be suspicious of unsolicited phone calls and emails. If it doesn’t sound right—just hang up! Be aware that a government agency would never ask you to send money a certain way or purchase gift cards. Just hang up! Resist their pressure to act immediately, before you have time to think or check their information. Contact Public Safety.
