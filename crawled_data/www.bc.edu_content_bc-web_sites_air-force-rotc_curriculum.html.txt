There may be options for a cadet to enroll as a junior, depending on the specific circumstances of their enrollment or programs available to an upper-level student. You will need to check with the detachment as these programs vary by year. As a college freshman or sophomore, you will register for an Air Force one-hour credit course and Leadership Laboratory. As a college junior or senior, you will register for an Air Force three-hour credit course and Leadership Laboratory. Upper class course times fluctuate per academic year. Students taking a compressed schedule, a period of non-attendance, or a term abroad may have to take multiple sessions in order to complete the program on time. Classes for Spring 2022 are: Leadership Laboratory (AS 101): Wed 4:30-6:30 p.m. (All Cadets) AS 100 (Freshman) course section(s): Wed 3:30-4:20 p.m. AS 200 (Sophomore) course section(s): Wed 2:30-3:20 p.m. AS 300 (Juniors) course section: Tues 6:30-9:30 p.m. (May be adjusted by instructor) AS 400 (Seniors) course section: Mon 6:30-9:30 p.m. (May be adjusted by instructor) Freshman GMC academic classes meeting one hour a week focus on the functions, organizations, and hardware of the U.S. Air Force. Sophomore classes also meeting one hour a week concentrate on the evolution of aerospace power from the Wright brothers through the space program. Aerospace Studies class activities during the junior year center on management and leadership in a U.S. Air Force setting; standard textual material on management is supplemented by case studies cast in a U.S. Air Force setting. The senior year Aerospace Studies curriculum examines national defense policy and the military in American society. All POC academic classes meet three hours per week. Complementing the academic classes, a weekly leadership laboratory introduces students to U.S. Air Force customs, courtesies, drills, ceremonies, and lifestyles. Guest lecturers, seminars, briefings, films, and practical experience are also included. In addition, you will also be required to attend two physical training (PT) sessions per week. These are Tuesday and Thursday at 0550 (subject to change). Alternate PT options may be available for cadets on varsity sports teams, by exception. Students already attending law school wishing to serve as Air Force Judge Advocate Generals (JAGs) may apply for a one- or two-year program through the Air Force JAG website. Officer training will be provided by the AFROTC detachment at an accelerated pace to meet Air Force recruiting goals.
