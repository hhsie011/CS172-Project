Many of these awards support post-graduate study, research, or international engagement. In addition, notable awards such as the Goldwater, Boren, Critical Language Scholarship, Gilman, and NSF-REU fund student research and study at the undergraduate level. Many of these awards are prestigious and highly competitive, and it is usually the case that students don't know how to navigate these waters alone—nor should they! That is why we are here to help. The Office of Engaged Learning guides students through every step of considering and applying for fellowships and awards—from understanding which awards might be right for a student, to helping draft application materials, obtain recommendation letters and university endorsements, and forge the international networks that are sometimes required so students can realize their aspirations. In sum, we seek to inform Baylor students about rich opportunities for study, research, and professional experience available to them, and then to equip them, walk alongside them as they pursue these opportunities through a formal application process.
