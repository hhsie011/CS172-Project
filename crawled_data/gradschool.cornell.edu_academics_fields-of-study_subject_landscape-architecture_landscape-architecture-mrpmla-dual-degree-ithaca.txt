(dual degree) (Ithaca) Field of Study Landscape Architecture Program Description The dual master's degree in regional planning (M.R.P.) and landscape architecture (M.L.A.) and is a professionally accredited degree intended for students with an interest in both planning and design issues. Landscape architecture (LA) students interested in the social, political, and economic context in which design occurs, or planning students who want to establish a deeper concentration in physical design and planning than the existing planning curriculum can provide, are ideal candidates for the dual degree program. The dual degree prepares students for work in areas such as physical planning, environmental analysis, community development, and urban design — skills which are highly sought after in the public, private, and nonprofit sectors. Students apply for admission to the dual degree generally after already being accepted to either CRP or LA, but need to be admitted to both programs separately. Typically, a student will apply to the complementary program during their first year at Cornell.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
