In 1988, we provided students with professional contacts utilizing a rolodex and index cards. Today, students browse potential mentors located across the globe at the click of a button through a sophisticated online database. How does the ProfessioNole Mentors program work? ProfessioNole Mentors is our entirely virtual mentoring network. Once the mentee and mentor profiles are fully completed, the ProfessioNole Mentors program recommends potential mentor matches to registered student mentees by aligning career interests and academic experiences. Conversations are always initiated by students with their selected mentor. How much time do I need to put in? There is no required time commitment, do what works for your schedule! You can engage in a single conversation or have a longer mentoring relationship over time. ProfessioNole Mentor Diversity Chat Series Through the ProfessioNole Mentors program, each semester the Career Center hosts Diversity Chats hosted by our registered ProfessioNole Mentors. These virtual chats are open to current students, alumni, faculty and staff. The chats provide a unique opportunity for our Mentors to share their diverse backgrounds and career experiences with students. Past topics have included: Navigating Race at Work, Succeeding in a Male Dominated Industry, Being Out at Work, etc. Students Activate your Student Mentee Profile!
