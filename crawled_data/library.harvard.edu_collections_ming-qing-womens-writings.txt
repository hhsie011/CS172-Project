An item from the Ming-Qing women's writings collection. View Details. Harvard-Yenching Library The Ming-Qing writings in this collection offer rich insight into women's roles in Chinese literature, history and culture from the 14th through the 20th centuries. The collection is also notable as one of the few collections of such materials to be widely accessible. In China, women's writing has often suffered from marginalization, neglect, and loss, meaning the examples that remain are largely held in hard-to-access rare book collections. Completed in collaboration with McGill University, the digitization of these 91 titles from the Harvard-Yenching Library ensures these texts are accessible to scholars worldwide. Accessing These Materials The titles from this collection are available online.
