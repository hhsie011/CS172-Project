What is a "liberal arts & sciences" education? Paying the admissions application fee is a hardship for my family. Can I get a waiver? Can I self-report my test scores? Do I need a minimum required SAT, ACT or Subject Test score? Helpful Links FAQs Applicant Portal Events Contact Us my.harvard Can I self-report my test scores? Frequently Asked Questions Article Yes. Applicants may provide self-reported SAT and ACT test scores (including other standardized tests). Admitted students who self-report scores and decide to enroll at Harvard College will be required to submit official test scores upon enrolling. View our application tips for specific information on how to self-report your scores. If you were eligible for a fee waiver from the SAT or ACT, you are eligible for unlimited free score reports to be sent to institutions to which you are applying. We recommend you use your free score reports to share your scores with Harvard.
