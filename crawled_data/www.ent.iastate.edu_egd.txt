Humans are at the core of Global Health, which is viewed and addressed through an understanding of disease, disease transmission, health and well-being. Global health incorporates all cultures and places and integrates knowledge of health's social, anthropological, historical, biological, and ecological dimensions. The program cultivates capacities to deal with complex problems across disciplines and social constructs: how to identify the critical issues, ask the right questions, and create solutions that are meaningful, lasting and effective. Requirements of the Global Health minor The Global Health minor will consist of selecting courses that have at their core a focus on health, disease transmission, and social aspects that pertain to health. The minor will require a minimum of 15 credit hours with all students required to take Global Health (VMPM/MICRO/GLOBE 360) and Insects and Our Health (ENT/MICRO 374). The remaining credits to fulfill the minor will come from courses listed in two tracks: Biological sciences of health Social sciences aspect of health Students must select a minimum of three credits from each of the two tracks, and an additional three credits from either track. Students may petition to take courses not on the approved list, providing these courses can be shown to include substantial study related to global health.
