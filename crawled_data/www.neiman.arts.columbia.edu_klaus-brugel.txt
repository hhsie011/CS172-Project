"Unless a sculpture exists in a vacuum, Bürgel explained, it is inherently dependent on its environment for its success. I was interested in a dialogue between the photographed image and my memory of taking it, a dialogue with the space, a dialogue with the material, and a dialogue between process and result." The resulting prints investigate the longing of sculpture for a place and explore the tension that occurs between volume, space, form, and construction. The use of digital color photography and screenprint creates contrasting glossy and matte areas on the surface of the prints. Bürgel (b. 1958 Radolfzell, Germany) received his MFA at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Munich in 1993. He has participated in numerous group shows and had solo exhibitions at the Oliver Art Center, Frankfort, MI; California College of Arts and Crafts, Oakland, CA; Bernard Toale Gallery Boston, MA; Goethe Institute, Boston, MA; and Jewelerswerk Gallery, Washington D.C. Bürgel has taught at the Maine College of Art, Portland, ME; Rhode Island School of Design, Providence, RI; California College of Arts, Oakland, CA; School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, MA; Parsons School of Design, New York, NY. He lives and works in New York City.
