Our work is directed toward understanding biological systems at the gene, individual, population, and community levels of organization. Major conceptual areas pursued by our department include animal locomotion and functional morphology, ecology of marine and terrestrial communities, conservation biology and environmental science, and population and evolutionary genomics. We study a wide variety of organisms - both living and extinct - spanning the tree of life, including microbes, plants and algae, marine invertebrates, terrestrial arthropods, reptiles, birds, and mammals, including humans.
