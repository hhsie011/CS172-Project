Home Home Students Parents Faculty & Staff Alumni College of the Environment Earth and Space Sciences 070 Johnson Hall 206-543-1190 Website Faculty Website essadv@uw.edu Earth and Space Sciences seeks to further our understanding of the Earth, the solar system, and their histories. The scope extends from the center of Earth to the rim of the solar system, and activities cut across traditional disciplines of physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and mathematics. The discipline examines Earth's interior structure, chemistry, motion, and dynamics; the processes affecting its landscapes, including ice and climate; natural hazards; the surrounding space environment; planetary processes; and geobiology.
