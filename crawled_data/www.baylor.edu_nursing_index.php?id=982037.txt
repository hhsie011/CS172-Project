As members of the nursing profession, we pray you have felt an unprecedented amount of love, support, and encouragement from the community over the past year and a half. On Saturday, September 18, we gathered at the nursing school with over 100 alumni for our annual Alumni Reunion and celebrated the accomplishments of LHSON graduates. Although the event normally recognizes all graduates celebrating their 50th, 40th, and 30th anniversaries, this year was made doubly special as we honored not only the classes of 1971, 1981, and 1991, but also the classes of 1970, 1980, and 1990. Thank you to all who attended. To view the program click here. Attendees visited the nursing school campus to learn about all of the exciting happenings at LHSON, including the installment of our new Dean, Dr. Linda Plank. A Baylor graduate and long-time LHSON faculty member and administrator, Dean Plank served as Interim Dean before being selected for the role full-time earlier this year. The Baylor Connections podcast recently featured Dean Plank. In that episode, which may be found here, Dean Plank provides an update on the nursing school and details challenges facing current students. During the Alumni Reunion luncheon, attendees enjoyed a music video, Let Them See Jesus. The video features a song written by Class of 2013 alumnae, Bekah Lemonds and Bethany Gebhard. The video was produced by generous and long-time supporters of the nursing school, Lisa Stepp, an LHSON grad and her late sister, Dr. Kathy Tinius, a Baylor alum. The video was especially touching and poignant, given Dr. Tinius’ recent passing this summer. The luncheon provided a time to commemorate the lives of Dr. Tinius and Wayne Tucker, both of whom previously received the Friend of Nursing Award. It was also our privilege to continue the tradition of honoring several outstanding individuals with awards to acknowledge their commitment and support of nursing.

Thank you for your generosity and for making meaningful difference in the lives of future Baylor nurses. If you would still like to make a gift, please click here. Now, more than ever, the impact of nurses is felt worldwide. LHSON is leading the way by holistically preparing and educating students in mind and spirit to fulfill their calling.
