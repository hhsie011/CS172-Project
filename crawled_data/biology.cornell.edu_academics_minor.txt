Opportunities to integrate biological sciences into your academic plan exist. Students who matriculated to Cornell prior to August 2021 may still complete the minor. Students who matriculate August 2021 or after are encouraged to meet with an OUB advisor to discuss curricular and co-curricular options, outside of the major, to pursue their interests. There are many options for students to gain breadth and/or depth in most aspects of biology and the advisors in the OUB are eager to work individually with students to address their interests and meet their goals. The minor in biological sciences has been designed to provide students with a broad background in biology while allowing them significant flexibility to choose courses of interest. Students enrolled in any of Cornell’s seven undergraduate colleges may declare the minor. Students must submit the Application to Certify Completion form once they completed all courses for the minor or during their last semester of enrollment. The OUB will notify the student’s college Registrar that the minor has been certified and a notation will be made on the student’s transcript.
