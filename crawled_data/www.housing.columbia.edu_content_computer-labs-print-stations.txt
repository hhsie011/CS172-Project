Computer Labs CUIT maintains computer labs of varying sizes, some with on-staff lab consultants to assist you and troubleshoot problems onsite, and some that are self-service. Most include Windows machines, although there are a number with a mix of Mac and WIndows, and Mac-only labs available. Visit CUIT's Computer Lab Locations and Hours page for more details. The page provides information about how to report issues you experience at a lab, and this information is usually available in the labs themselves as well if you run into problems. Print Stations CUIT also manages the University's public printing system, called PawPrint. PawPrint stations are located in the libraries, most academic buildings, and a number of residence halls. View all PawPrint locations, as well as how to use the print service and add additional funds to your print account if necessary.
