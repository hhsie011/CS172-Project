CBLR Fellows work with instructors on planning and/or implementing specific engaged courses. While fellows’ responsibilities vary, they may serve as important peer mentors for students enrolled in the course to which they’re assigned, as well as liaisons between students, instructors, community partners, and Swearer Center staff. Structure CBLR Fellows receive a $1475 stipend for each semester. This leadership experience will ideally relate to students' academic interests, support their sustained engagement with community partners or issues they care about, and further their skills in communication, partnership development, organizing, and problem-solving. Fellows’ responsibilities vary somewhat from course to course but require approximately 7 hours per week. CBLR Fellows have worked with faculty members on: Curriculum development (e.g., identifying relevant course resources, designing assignments or reflective activities, etc.); Facilitating specific class discussions, reflection sessions, and/or holding student office hours; Cultivating and coordinating relationships with community partners; Mentoring students around community engagement components of a course; Documenting and disseminating the results of engaged courses; and Supporting longer-term engagement with community partners. More than one fellow can be matched with faculty of larger courses so that each fellow is responsible for no more than 20 students. Eligibility/Timeline Applications for the 2022-23 academic year are now closed. Applications for the 2023-24 academic year will open in November 2022. Any Brown University undergraduate with relevant experiences and interests may apply. While students are encouraged to serve as a CBLR Fellow in both Fall 2023 and Spring 2024, when possible, students able to commit for only one semester will be considered as well. Please note that students must be enrolled in Brown (either on-campus or remotely) during Spring 2023 to apply for this position and must also be enrolled during the semester(s) they serve as a CBLR Fellow. University policies do not allow students on personal leave or medical leave to be eligible for this opportunity. Apply Short applications will be accepted through UFunds. For more information on past application cycles, see: Call for Student Applications (2022-23 academic year); or Call for Faculty Applications (2022-23 academic year).
