Application Information Live with the Pack Graduate in 4-years Achieve higher GPAs Engage in Living Learning Communities Receive academic support Live in a safe and healthy environment; 24/7 security Participate in free, exclusive activities and events Rent includes all utilities and WiFi Convenient Living Students recognize us for convenience, beyond just proximity to classes. We have made renting easier by creating one-bill to include room rent, utilities (electricity, water, heat, A/C, garbage and recycling), Wi-Fi, community and study spaces, academic support, and free social events. Meaningful Connections Research shows that students who live on campus have stronger connections with faculty, better relationships with their peers, and participate in more student activities. Graduation Goals Students who live on campus have higher graduation rates and graduate faster than those who live off campus. Safe and Healthy Environment Our residents' health and safety in University housing and around campus is important to us. All of our Villages are locked 24 hours a day and require card access. Housing and Residential Education, in coordination with the University Police Department, work to provide a safe and healthy living environment for all our residents. Health measures are in place to promote wellness. Peace of Mind There are no hidden fees or change of contract rates once you move in. If someone moves out of your room or apartment, you will never be obligated to pay their bill; and if you are having issues in your room, our staff can help mediate or find a new space. Additionally, we encourage you to contact the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships regarding how best to finance living on-campus. Dining and Healthy Eating The CSUSB dining experience is more than great food. It is a community experience centered around a variety of food choices and healthy options. Coyote Commons offers an array of all-you-care-to-eat selections. Coyote Village residents are required to choose a meal plan, and returning (continuing) and transfer students can purchase a voluntary plan. Visit Yotie Eats to learn more.
