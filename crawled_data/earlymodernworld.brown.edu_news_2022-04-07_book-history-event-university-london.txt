Summer Term 2022: Thursdays, 2.00-4.30 pm (BST) NEW WORKSHOP SERIES: The Medieval Diagram as Subject (Institute of English Studies and Warburg Institute) Medieval diagrams typically combined text and visual features, ranging from geometric forms to elaborate imagery, in order to communicate complex ideas in a powerful and memorable way. As such they constitute important evidence for attitudes to design in the transmission of knowledge in the Middle Ages. The meaning of these terms could encompass a variety of forms and content and suggest different emphases for these complex works that often combined images and text in inventive and unexpected ways. The workshops will consider diagrams on all subjects and across different media in medieval visual culture, to address their design, function, and reception. *In-person (Senate House) and online.
