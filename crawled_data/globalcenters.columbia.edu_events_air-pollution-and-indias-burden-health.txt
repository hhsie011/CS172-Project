Energy emissions vary across urban and rural populations but monitoring is often limited only to urban regions. Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai invites you a lecture by Dr. Alexandra Karambelas from The Earth Institute at Columbia University on the links between energy emissions, air quality, and health outcomes along the Indo-Gangetic Plain and regionally across India. Her research uses an urban-versus-rural emissions framework to support and expand the use of air quality modeling with a view to offering appropriate regional mitigation strategies to improve health outcomes. About the Speaker Dr. Alexandra Karambelas is currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow of The Earth Institute at Columbia University. She received her PhD in Environment and Resources and also holds degrees in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, and a certificate in Energy Analysis and Policy from the University of Wisconsin—Madison.
