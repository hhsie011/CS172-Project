What were some challenges you face or things you learned throughout the process? As a future broadcast meteorologist, the job search process is not your typical run-of-the-mill application. I had to make an audition reel from all my broadcasts on the FSU Weather show. I had to re-watch all the segments I forecasted for since late 2020. It was difficult finding just the right clips to highlight my strengths as a broadcaster. My audition reel is my résumé, in a sense. After I finalized my audition reel, I posted it to YouTube and started emailing news stations that were hiring a broadcast meteorologist. I did not expect the reach I had from posting my reel to YouTube. I received over 25 job interviews for a on-air meteorology position. This is where my search became challenging. I had to narrow down my search to three stations and decide where I wanted to work. I had to weigh many things such as salary, location, benefits, and so much more when making my decision. I had made so many connections along the way, and having to turn down my new acquaintances was one of the most difficult and challenging trials I have faced in college. I learned that I have to go with my gut and follow my happiness. My family might be sad that I chose a station that is farther from home, but I know in my gut that I will prosper with my decision. If you used any Career Center services, resources, or events to obtain your experiential learning opportunity, what were they? I used the Career Center to review my résumé. The Career Center strengthened my résumé and made me stand out from other applicants. My future boss at the station I will begin working for in May even said so himself that my resume was incredibly organized, and it set me apart from the rest. Have you participated in any experiential learning opportunities while at FSU? My experiential learning was done in the FSU Weather Studio. I volunteered as on-air talent which eventually transitioned into a position where I actually helped produce one of the weekly shows. I would come in early Monday mornings and create graphics that would be displayed on the live show that evening. I learned so much from the FSU Weather program. I learned to become a stronger broadcast meteorologist and got my practice in on the green screen to make my on-air appearance more confident. Not only did FSU Weather help me with my on-air presence, but the behind-the-scenes of creating graphics is going to be a major help in the future when I have to create my own shows at the news station I have signed a job contract with. What advice do you have for current students who will be launching a full-time professional job search? Edit your résumé constantly. You don't want to get into a slump where you have not updated it in months and when the time comes for you to send it to a potential employer, it isn't a true display of who you are at the time. Another note would be to always have professional clothing on hand. I got lucky the past two years with COVID so I could easily throw a nice blouse on, but when I got to my in-person interviews a couple months ago, I was scrambling to make sure I had the perfect professional fit. Students can visit the ProfessioNole Clothing Closet to access free professional attire for career fairs, interviews, and the workplace. Allie Ann McCord "Edit your résumé constantly.
