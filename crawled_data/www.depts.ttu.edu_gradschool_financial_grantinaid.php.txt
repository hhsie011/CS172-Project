Texas Tech University Directory Raiderlink A-Z Index Graduate School Menu Search TTU Graduate School Financial Support Graduate Student Research Support This program is for Texas Tech University graduate students who are in need of funds to successfully complete their research (thesis/dissertation or non-thesis based). Funds may only be used for expenses directly related to research (e.g., supplies, software, research-related training, etc.). Funds may not be used for tuition and fee purposes or to purchase computers/laptops. It is anticipated that there will be two grant cycles during the academic year, one in the fall and one in the spring. This award is disbursed as a scholarship. Variable award amounts of up to $1,500 per award. Funding made possible through generous support of The CH Foundation, Texas Tech Office of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion, and the Graduate School. Please note: The Graduate Student Research Support program is only for research related expenses. Requests for travel funding to attend and present work at a scholarly conference should be submitted here: Student Travel Funding. As noted above, this support is disbursed as a scholarship. If a student has a balance with SBS, the scholarship will apply to their balance thus making funding available that the student would have had to pay for tuition and fees to be directed to support their research expenses outlined in their GSRS application. If the student does not have an SBS balance, the scholarship applies to their bill and is refunded to the recipient to utilize for the research expenses outlined in their GSRS application. If one of these options is not feasible for the student's expenses, please contact our office at gradfellowships@ttu.edu. The application cycle for the spring 2022 semester is now closed. Please see below for application cycle dates and deadlines Eligibility: Any Texas Tech University student pursuing a Master's or Doctorate who has been enrolled in a degree program for at least one semester is eligible to apply. A graduate student is eligible to receive a Graduate Student Research Support award only once in their entire academic career at Texas Tech University. However, students may apply multiple times if previous applications were not awarded. Expected Yearly Timetable: Application Open Application Deadline Award Date August 20 September 20 October 20 December 15 January 22 February 22 From Here, It's Possible Texas Tech is proud to offer these awards which are designed to recognize and reward outstanding excellence and research of graduate students and faculty.
