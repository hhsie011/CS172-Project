Clemson Family Advisory Board makes every effort to be a well-informed resource for the University, assist in academic recruiting and offer the parents perspective to the University. An individual parent or a couple who is interested in serving on CFAB may apply for Board membership in November of each year, as parents of graduating students rotate off. If you have any questions about the Board or the application process, please contact the Center for Student Leadership and Engagement at 864-656-0515, or email cufamilies@clemson.edu.
