Student life in the residence hall is not separate from the academic mission of the University, but rather supportive of students' total development. Within the mission of our work as Residential Life, we strive to promote core values that encompass what we hope students will gain through living and learning in our Residence Halls. Brown's residence halls include 49 buildings that total approximately 1.6 million square feet. The oldest was built in 1822 and the newest in 2012. The Main Green is no more than a five to ten-minute walk from any first-year residence hall. All residence halls are smoke-free. Residence halls at Brown are coed, which means that men and women are housed on the same floor in most instances. Residence Hall Common Areas Lounges and kitchens are well-used and important parts of Brown's residence halls.

All actively-enrolled undergraduate students, whether living on campus or off campus, are required to maintain a mailbox at the University mailroom in Page Robinson Hall. Students will retain the same assigned mailbox for the duration of their undergraduate studies, provided they do not separate from the University (e.g., study away or take a leave of absence). For more information regarding policies and correct formats for postal mail and packages, visit Brown University Mail Services. Do Laundry Laundry machines are available in the residence halls for student use. You may swipe your Brown ID Card to pay for the washers and dryers. You may add money to your Brown ID through the Bear Bucks website. For more information on the use of your card, please contact the Brown Card Office (401-863-2273). You will need to bring laundry supplies (hamper, detergent, softener, dryer sheets, etc.) if you decide to do your own laundry. Brown Student Agencies also offers a laundry service.
