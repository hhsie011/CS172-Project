The bulk of the very substantial body of work we celebrate in this exhibition parallels his efforts to make sense of the mortal circumstance he suddenly confronted when diagnosed with a fatal illness and his need to keep seeing the world through the lens of endless opportunities and possibilities. Margret Kentgens-Craig, a professor of the practice in the College of Design, and Roger Manley, director of the Gregg Museum of Art & Design, curated Frank Lee Craig–Near Distance.
