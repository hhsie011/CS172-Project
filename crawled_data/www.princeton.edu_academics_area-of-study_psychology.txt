PSY 208 The Brain: A User's Guide Professor/Instructor A survey of brain and mind, emphasizing issues related to human behavior. Topics include: psychoactive drugs, aging and Alzheimer's disease, reengineering the brain, learning and memory, sleep-waking and biological rhythms, and major mental diseases.

PSY 214 Human Identity in the Age of Neuroscience and Information Technology Professor/InstructorDaniel N. Osherson A central challenge for modern society is to construct individual and group identity in the face of technologies that come ever closer to understanding the mechanisms of thought and feeling. We live in a time when cognitive neuroscience is poised to trace the executive functions of the mind to the workings of the brain, and computer science is coming closer to replicating those functions. This course offers a multidisciplinary introduction to the scientific and social issues that underlie the potential cultural impact of advances in self-understanding. Faculty from a wide range of departments provide lectures. Two lectures, one preceptorial. LIN 216 / PSY 216 Language, Mind, and Brain Professor/Instructor This course examines the complex mental and neurological processes that underlie linguistic knowledge and behavior. It will be concerned with the precise description and measurement of language activity, with its governing principles, and with available indices for the associated neural computations and their location in the brain. Seminar. PSY 237 / PHI 237 The Psychology and Philosophy of Rationality Professor/InstructorEldar Shafir, Philip Nicholas Johnson-Laird, Gilbert H. Harman The human capacity for rationality is fundamental; however there is ample evidence for irrationality in human affairs--including notions such as hysteria, addiction, lack of self-control, wishful thinking, and self-deception. This course considers both errors and achievements, providing an introduction to a wide array of topics, such as logic, probability, decision theory, relativism, and psychopathology. It provides a background for further study of subjects such as logic, philosophy of mind, cognitive psychology, cognitive science, the psychology of judgment and choice, and the psychology of thinking. One two-hour lecture, one preceptorial. PSY 251 Quantitative Methods Professor/InstructorJustin Anthony Junge A general introduction to statistical techniques, both descriptive and inferential, employed by psychologists. Required for concentrators. Two lectures, one laboratory. PSY 252 Social Psychology Professor/InstructorDiana I. Tamir The scientific study of social behavior, with an emphasis on social interaction and group influence.

PSY 255 / CGS 255 Cognitive Psychology Professor/InstructorTania Lombrozo The course will survey the major themes and experimental findings of cognitive psychology and consider their relevance to the cognitive sciences in general. Topics covered will include attention, perception, imagery, memory, language, and reasoning. Two lectures, one preceptorial. PSY 257 Personality Professor/Instructor A survey of major approaches to the study of personality, including psychodynamic, social learning, and trait-theory approaches.

NEU 201 / PSY 258 Fundamentals of Neuroscience Professor/InstructorIlana Basya Witten This is a survey course in neurobiology which takes a mechanistic and reductionist perspective to cover important topics in the field, including the physiological basis of neural excitability, sensory and motor processing, learning and memory, and neuropsychiatric diseases. NEU 202 / PSY 259 Introduction to Cognitive Neuroscience Professor/InstructorMatthew M. Botvinick An introduction to cognitive brain functions, including higher perceptual functions, attention and selective perception, systems for short- and long-term memory, language, cerebral lateralization, motor control, executive functions of the frontal lobe, cognitive development and plasticity, and the problem of consciousness. Major neuropsychological syndromes (e.g., agnosia, amnesia) will be discussed. Prerequisite: 258 or instructor's permission. Two 90-minute lectures, one preceptorial. LIN 314 / PSY 302 Linguistics and Language Acquisition Professor/InstructorAdele E. Goldberg What does it mean to know a language? Is it something we learn or something the brain "grows?" What aspects of language are innate? Is parents' speech important in language learning? An examination of the properties of child language through the lens of current linguistic theory. Two 90-minute classes. PSY 306 / NEU 306 Memory and Cognition Professor/InstructorKenneth Andrew Norman Empirical facts, theoretical issues, and scientific techniques in the area of human memory. Potential topics include models of memory, eyewitness testimony, comprehension, representation of knowledge, autobiographical memory, reality monitoring, amnesia, and other disorders of memory and cognition. Two lectures, one preceptorial. Prerequisite: 255 or 259, or instructor's permission.
