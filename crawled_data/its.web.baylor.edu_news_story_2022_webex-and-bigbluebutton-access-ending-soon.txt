The widespread adoption of these two, relative newcomers to the field of videoconferencing quickly outpaced the use of the university's long-standing Webex by Cisco and BigBlueButton platforms. In order to maintain continuity during Baylor's ongoing response to the pandemic, the university has continued to license Webex, BigBlueButton, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom. In the fall, a survey and analysis was undertaken to assess the best videoconferencing options for Baylor going forward. In the final assessment, it was determined that Baylor will continue to license Microsoft Teams and Zoom, and will end licensing for Webex and BigBlueButton. At the conclusion of the spring term, Webex and BigBlueButton will no longer be available in Canvas. Going forward, Zoom and Microsoft Teams can be featured as menu items in Canvas courses by selecting Settings, the Navigation tab, dragging each from the list of hidden items to the top section of the page, and then clicking the Save button. At the end of June, Baylor's Webex license will expire and will no longer be available for faculty and staff to schedule or host videoconferences. If a conversation or conference external to Baylor is hosted on Webex by another party, Webex can be used on any device as a participant by students, faculty or staff. In rare cases, faculty or staff may need to conduct a videoconference that is in compliance with HIPAA. The university has expanded its capabilities within Zoom to support this need, but special access must be requested from HelpDesk+ at (254) 710-4357. Any questions about this transition should be directed to HelpDesk+ on the garden level of Moody Memorial Library, by phone at (254) 710-4357, or by email at helpdesk@baylor.edu.
