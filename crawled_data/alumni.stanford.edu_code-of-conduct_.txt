We hope that all members of the Stanford community take responsibility for sustaining the high ethical standards of the university and that all students and alumni feel they are welcome at all Stanford activities in any way in which they choose to participate. To this end, alumni volunteers and participants and their non-alumni guests are expected to abide by the following tenets of our code of conduct when engaging with any Stanford offering, activity, or communication. For SAA Volunteers As a Stanford Alumni Association volunteer, you are expected to adhere to Stanford’s Code of Conduct for ethical and professional standards of behavior. At the heart of this code is the principle of treating others with respect, integrity, honesty, and fairness. Serving in a volunteer leadership role is a privilege and the SAA reserves the right to revoke the opportunity if deemed necessary. The key components of the code include: Integrity and Quality Volunteers should conduct university business transactions with the utmost honesty, accuracy, and fairness. Expediency should never compromise integrity. Respect for Others Volunteers should treat each university community member fairly and with respect. Volunteers should embrace diversity and inclusion. Confidentiality, Privacy, and Information Security Volunteers should obtain and use only information pertinent to the university activity for which it was intended. We are individually and collectively accountable for our behavior. For Participants in Stanford Offerings, Activities, and/or Communications By registering for any Stanford activity or participating in any Stanford offering, activity, or communication, you and your guests agree to uphold the Stanford Alumni Association Code of Conduct. Violations of the Stanford Alumni Association Code of Conduct include any behavior and/or language which defames, abuses, or threatens others; is racially or sexually harassing; or is bigoted, hateful, or racially offensive. While the university code of conduct applies only to those who are working for or on behalf of the university, we would like to see all participants in Stanford offerings, activities or communications comport themselves in a manner that is in keeping with the spirit of the university’s code of conduct, upholding the values of respect, integrity, honesty, and fairness. If participants observe inappropriate behavior at an event they should inform any Stanford staff member in attendance. If no Stanford staff member is available they should inform the Stanford Alumni Association at alumni-feedback@stanford.edu.
