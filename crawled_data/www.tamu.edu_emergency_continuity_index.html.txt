Continuity planning helps Texas A&M departments and organizations respond to a major disaster or disruption so that essential functions can continue with minimum downtime. A continuity plan is a collection of resources, actions, procedures, and information that is developed, tested, and held in readiness for use in the event of a disaster or major disruption of operations.
