Sinn '00 Department of Finance As one of the country’s top finance departments, our goal is to provide students with the theoretical and empirical tools necessary to achieve high levels of expertise in all areas of finance. Our graduates are well prepared to work in both private and public sectors in areas such as: asset management; commercial and investment banking; financial management in government and not-for-profit organizations; insurance, real estate, public accounting, and health systems. In addition, a concentration in finance offers a comprehensive perspective for understanding global issues and financial engineering. Degrees The Department of Finance offers four distinct programs of study: The Bachelor of Business Administration in Finance program provides undergraduate students with the fundamentals in the areas of corporate finance, investments, markets, and institutions. The Master of Real Estate Program (MRE Program) concentrates on the study of finance, real estate law, economics, market analysis, and negotiations. This 36-hour, non-thesis graduate program develops advanced competencies and skills needed for a successful career in the real estate industry. The Master of Science in Finance (MSF) program is designed for students with a quantitative (e.g., STEM*, economics, finance, accounting) undergraduate degree who are seeking to begin a career in the rewarding world of finance. The Ph.D. in Business Administration – Finance program provides rigorous coursework and research opportunities for those students seeking an understanding of the theoretical, conceptual, and managerial foundations of finance. In addition, the department supports student involvement in a wide variety of certificate and enrichment programs for those looking to supplement their education. Student Resources Hands-on experience is, without a doubt, one of the best ways to prepare students for their future careers. Our department, in conjunction with the Mays Business School, sponsors a number of enriching activities for students to gain insight into the world of finance. We encourage students exploration of student organizations, academic centers such as the Reliant Energy Trading Center, and other resources.
