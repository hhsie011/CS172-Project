Cornell has a range of resources to help you with every step in this process—such as personal assessments or a goal-setting tool called an individual development plan (IDP)—which are listed in more detail below. Cornell Resources to Help You Create Your Plan Self-Assessments All graduate students are encouraged to meet with a Cornell career advisor to take an assessment to understand their personality, interests, values, and career goals. Postdocs may discuss their interests, values, and career goals with Christine Holmes (ch18@cornell.edu), director of the Office of Postdoctoral Studies. Find assessments available to all graduate students. Find free online assessments available to all students and postdocs. Ask yourself reflection questions to identify your career goals, interests, and skills. External Resources Individual Development Plan (IDP) The IDP is an excellent tool for self-assessment and developing goals for yourself during your academic years and beyond. Although you can create your IDP by yourself, graduate students and postdocs often find that co-developing their IDP with their faculty mentor is a good way to ensure there is awareness and support of their career plans.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
