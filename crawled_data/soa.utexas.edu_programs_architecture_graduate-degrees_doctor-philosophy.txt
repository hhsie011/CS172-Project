It provides students holding an appropriate master's degree with a rigorous program of study intended to prepare them to conduct research and teach in these disciplines. HISTORY OF ARCHITECTURE AND LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE The concentration in the history of architecture and landscape architecture places special emphasis on understanding buildings or landscapes and their designers in their historical contexts as complex and interconnected wholes that include aspects of aesthetics, tectonics, function, culture, and meaning. The student's program of study may address the history of architectural theory; the history of design; the history of interior design; the history of urban design, settlements, or cities; the history of building technology; and the history of landscape design. HISTORIC PRESERVATION The concentration in historic preservation embraces multi-disciplinary and culturally diverse approaches to the conservation of historic resources. The student's program may address preservation planning and development; issues in the theory, history, and practice of the conservation of buildings, interiors, landscapes and neighborhoods; preservation-based strategies of sustainable development; and innovative methodologies for preservation practice. SUSTAINABILITY The concentration in sustainability is practical, technical, and philosophical in scope and integrates three areas of inquiry related to the built environment, biophysical systems, building systems, and political systems. The study of biophysical systems relies upon the disciplines of natural and urban ecological sciences as they relate to architecture. The study of building systems includes investigating component technologies necessary to construct environmentally responsive architecture. The study of political systems situates the biophysical and building systems within the social and political contexts of architectural practice. Program of Work Students entering the PhD program with a master's degree should anticipate two years of full-time coursework (nine units per semester) leading to the qualifying examination. The minimum registration requirement for the research and writing of the dissertation is three units per semester. Additional hours may be required for foreign language study or other courses the doctoral subcommittee determines to be pre-requisites for advanced study.
