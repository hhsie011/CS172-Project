Students can choose between two programs—Secondary Education: Mathematics and TUTeach. These differ in terms of the proportion of courses in the Mathematics major and that of education-related courses on the nature of adolescents and how to teach. Students seeking certification in Secondary Education: Mathematics must complete the requirements for the major in Secondary Education: Mathematics and for the Mathematics major as specified by the College of Science and Technology. Your education coursework is augmented with multiple fieldwork assignments. The program culminates in an academic semester long practicum, during which you will instruct a class at an area high school supported by a cooperating teacher and Temple faculty.

The curriculum is designed to provide candidates with knowledge of the interests and abilities of students at different levels of mathematics achievement. The program emphasizes problem-solving skills, mathematical thinking processes and methods of actively engaging children and young adults in their own learning. The program includes 16 courses offered by the College of Science and Technology that provide comprehensive content knowledge of mathematics (e.g., calculus, modern geometry, probability theory, etc.); and 15 courses offered by the College of Education and Human Development that provide comprehensive knowledge of adolescent development and effective techniques for teaching mathematics to diverse learners.
