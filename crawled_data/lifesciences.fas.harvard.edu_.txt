The Office of Science Education brings you resources for improving undergraduate science education at Harvard for both the Physical Sciences and the Life Sciences Concentration Cluster, under the support and direction of The Division of Science which fosters learning and collaboration cross disiplines. Undergraduate Education in the LIFE SCIENCES The Life Sciences Concentration Cluster consists of nine concentrations with common introductory foundation courses. We aim to bring you all of the flexibility and expansive undergraduate science education experience and access you expect here at Harvard. You can find the Life Sciences Advising Booklet here. Biomedical engineering The Chemical and Physical Biology (CPB) Chemistry Cognitive Neuroscience & Evolutionary Psychology (CN&EP) Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology (HDRB) Human evolutionary biology Integrative Biology (IB)/Organismic and Evolutionary Biology (OEB) Molecular and Cellular Biology (MCB) Neuroscience Undergraduate Education in the PHYSICAL SCIENCES The Physical Sciences has extraordinary resources for study and research, with ample opportunity for collaboration between disciplines. Students typically begin their study either with interdisciplinary courses in the Physical Sciences sequence or with foundational courses in one of the relevant departments. As you continue in the Physical Sciences, courses become concentration focused.
