Courses cannot be used to meet minor requirements if already used to meet the requirements for a major or a different minor or certificate. Courses for the minor must be completed prior to graduation; if completed, the minor will be recorded on the final transcript upon graduation. To declare or rescind this minor, visit the Fox School of Business and Management. Foundation courses can be completed 100% online. Many, but not all, of the electives are online. Interested students should discuss with their home college advisors how the courses in the minor will fit into their overall degree plan and are strongly encouraged to declare the minor early in their academic career.
