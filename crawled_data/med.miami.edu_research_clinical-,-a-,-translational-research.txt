Alumni Giving Home Research Clinical and Translational Research Clinical & Translational Research With clinical research, we use research studies to address specific health questions. Observational research studies health concerns in large groups of people, or clinical trials, and seeks to determine the safety and efficacy of medications, treatments, diet, devices, physical activity, or other interventions. Moving the studies a step further, translational research takes scientific discoveries found in the laboratory and transforms them into methods of preventing, diagnosing, or treating disease.
