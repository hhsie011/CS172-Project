In the case of ZMBBI investigators, the letter should be signed by the Chair of the academic Department where the investigator has his/her primary appointment and a Co-Director and the Executive Director of ZMBBI. The letter should be forwarded to the applicable SPA Project Officer. The waiver request letter must include an acknowledgement that the applicable department and school (or equivalent institutional units) will provide any required oversight and bears overall responsibility for the project, including financial, managerial and programmatic responsibility. The letter must also include confirmation that appropriate non-sponsored support will be provided to cover proposal writing and other non-sponsored activities of the investigator for whom the exception is sought. The investigator’s curriculum vitae and an abstract of the project covered by the exception should accompany the letter.
