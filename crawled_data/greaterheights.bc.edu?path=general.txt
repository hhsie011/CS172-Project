About Campaign Priorities Impact Stories Give Online Reaching for Greatness And it starts with our BC community... The heart of every Boston College student-athlete beats strong with a desire to do more and to be greater. Our Jesuit ethos, magis—or “more”—fuels our Eagles and our athletic programs to aim higher, train harder, and compete with greater determination every day. Their success starts with you. Whether it’s the rush of a roaring crowd at the buzzer beater or the investment from alumni and donors in facilities or equipment that says “I believe in you,” our student-athletes look to the BC community to be their champion. With the Greater Heights campaign, we seek to partner with our BC community to build an elite ACC program that fully enriches the student-athlete experience, enhances the alumni experience at Boston College, and raises the national profile of our world-class academic institution.
