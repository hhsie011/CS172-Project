We prepare graduates for successful careers and enlightening graduate programs to meet the needs of employers and embark on compelling research endeavors in graduate school. Electrical and computer engineers are responsible for improving the day-to-day operations of citizens around the world who depend on electricity and electrical devices. These specialists help accelerate the development of the world by making current technology such as computers and communications infrastructure more widely available. Students have an opportunity to join two professional electrical engineering organizations: the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the national electrical engineering honor society Eta Kappa Nu. TU’s IEEE chapter hosts bi-weekly meetings for students and faculty as well as special activities throughout the year. The TU Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering is a member of the ETAP Power Lab Program. Electrical Engineering Summer Academy The Summer Engineering Academy at The University of Tulsa for Precollege Students is scheduled for June 18 – 22, 2018, and is for students interested in careers in electrical and mechanical engineering. This cost free, day-only, commuter academy, allows students to experience engineering through hands-on design projects, seminars, industry professional interaction, and an integrated project related to traffic crash reconstruction. The faculty of the Academy includes professors from the Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Education Departments at TU and local high school teachers. The teachers receive training prior to the academy and use this training to help students with the academy’s activities. Teachers also receive support to implement the academy exercises, or similar ones, within their classrooms. The Director is Professor Peter LoPresti, 918-631-3274 or peter-lopresti@utulsa.edu.
