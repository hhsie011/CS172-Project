They are currently working on a Gates Institute supported project titled “Project MUSE” which looks to bridge the disconnect between arts and research by working with artists to raise awareness and create movements around public health issues. As part of their project, they will develop inspiring and socially-conscious music content as well as organize discussions on how to address issues through art using entertainment-education methodologies. The purpose of this workshop is to look at the ways in which music can be used to advocate for various causes, the tools needed to create advocacy music, a walkthrough of case studies and example projects, a survey for workshop participants on perception and understanding of advocacy music, and will end with a presentation on data and impact outcomes from their pilot project. This workshop is one of many workshops designed to lead up to a larger panel discussion that will take place in Marrakech, Morocco in April 2020 at the Social and Behavior Change Communication summit which will involve Trevor, Otuck, and five other artists from around the world. *This discussion is a continuation of the "Beyond the Music" series which took place 2017 in Kenya and 2018 in Tanzania.
