A lot has changed. The past century has featured a remarkable evolution for Wichita State, one in which the school has grown from a small Christian college to a large state university – punctuated by two name changes and a few thousand extra students. Together with the City of Wichita, WSU has built one of the most unique partnerships in Kansas. It's a relationship that supplies the lifeblood of a thriving community and makes it possible to provide the most well-rounded education in the region. Today, the university continues its evolution through collaboration, innovation, applied learning and entrepreneurship – creating the ideal environment for students, industry and community to work together and build a bright future for our city, region and world. 1845 Fairmount St.Wichita, Kansas 67260 USA (316) 978-3456 Request InfoVisitApply Contact Us Virtual Tour Campus Map and Directions Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube TikTok Wichita State has helped me put marketing strategy in a real-world perspective.
