As a result, programming is developed to be as inclusive of all populations as possible and to include addressing career/life issues. The Department of Inclusion and Workforce Diversity provides leadership in identifying strategies to address staff diversity issues, ensures compliance with federal affirmative action regulations, leads the university’s Title IX efforts, supports disability access efforts for the university, and implements programming to address the career/life challenges of students, faculty and staff. Diversity Council Resources Information about Cornell’s diversity recruitment and retention programs and resources, including training and networking opportunities to support communities of color, disabilities, LGBT, military veterans, women, and religions. Colleague Network Groups Cornell’s Colleague Network Groups are university-sponsored employee resource groups for diverse populations, including racial/ethnic minorities, differently abled, young professionals, LGBT, and veterans, and allies of those groups. The groups provide programs that enhance the university culture by fully engaging all our faculty and staff. Each group advocates for a specific demographic within the Cornell faculty and staff community—to aid in recruitment and retention efforts, as well as improve the climate for the community as a whole.
