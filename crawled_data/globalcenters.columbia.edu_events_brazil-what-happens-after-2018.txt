Events Past Event Brazil: What Happens after 2018? Share Add to Calendar: Google Yahoo November 14, 2017 5:30 PM - 7:30 PM 1161 Amsterdam Avenue, Columbia University - New York, NY 10027, United States Political polarization and democracy itself are under severe strain in Brazil. Economic decline has been severe amid evidence of abundant corruption at the highest levels of government. In this context, the presidential election scheduled for October 2018 represents a fork in the road. Will the current crisis deepen? Or will the country move toward recovery? Understanding the likely consequences of the elections is the major challenge in Brazil today. In this lecture, former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, noted scholar and politician, will help us to look beyond the elections to understand the consequences for critical public policies in education and public security, for political stability and the fight against corruption, and, finally, for a restoration of economic growth in the largest society in Latin America. Sponsored by the Lemann Center for Brazilian Studies and the Columbia Global Centers | Rio de Janeiro, the talk will take place at the Italian Academy, 1161 Amsterdam Avenue, on November 14 at 5:30 PM NY time (20:30 Brazil time). RSVP is required. Please, register here. >> For those who can not attend the event in New York, it will be livestreamed above or on this link. Fernando Henrique Cardoso (FHC) is one of the most important politicians and intellectuals in Latin America. As an activist for democracy in Brazil, FHC was elected to the presidency of his country in 1994, eventually serving two full terms in office. He presided over the first peaceful transition of power in democratic Brazil when President Lula succeeded him in 2003. During his time in office, he emphasized economic reforms, privatization, foreign investment, and funding for social services and education. FHC is best known for the economic reforms that succeeded in halting the chronic hyperinflation that plagued the country and for introducing a new, stable currency through the Plano Real. FHC was also a Senator, Minister of Foreign Relations, and Minister of Finance. In addition to his prominent role in Brazilian politics today and in the past, he is a sociologist, professor and researcher who has written extensively about social change, development, and democracy. FHC is Professor Emeritus of the University of São Paulo. His academic career has also included visiting posts at the University of Chile, University of California at Berkeley, and Brown University in the United States as well as at Cambridge University in the U.K. England. He served as President of the International Sociological Association from 1982-1986 and has received honorary doctoral degrees from more than 20 prestigious universities around the world. FHC is an honorary foreign member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
