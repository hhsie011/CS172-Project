ID Card Policy (August 2002, amended August 2011, September 2014) The Cornell University identification card identifies you as a current member of the Cornell community. Depending on your relationship to the university and the services that you sign up for, your ID card can also be used as an electronic door key and to access a variety of functions and facilities on campus. This includes athletic events, Cornellcard charges, dining units, fitness centers, libraries, transportation services, and parking and vending machines. The ID card is the property of the university, must be carried at all times, and is non-transferable. It may be used for such purposes as the university designates and may be revoked at any time. This card must be presented and/or surrendered upon demand by a university official. Failure to do so, or lending this card to anyone, is considered misuse and may subject the holder to disciplinary action, under the Campus Code of Conduct. Lost and stolen cards must be reported promptly to the Office of the University Registrar. There is a $40 replacement fee for lost, stolen, or damaged Student ID cards. The fee can be paid by cash, check, or charged to the Student's Bursar account. No person shall possess more than one Cornell University identification card. All cards, not previously replaced, that have been turned in to the Office of the University Registrar are kept on file for one complete semester to enable the person to claim the lost identification card. If the person has already replaced his/her identification card when the original one is turned in, the found identification card is destroyed. This action is noted on the card report/replacement form that was filled out when the card was lost. Students with Cornellcard privileges are responsible for charges incurred by use of this card (up to $50.00, if reported lost or stolen). Refer to the Cornellcard contract for specific terms. Current cards, including lost or defective cards are void upon termination or interruption of enrollment and/or employment and will not be replaced. At present, there is no provision for a temporary identification card, whether it be for a visitor on campus or a lost card, issued through the Office of the University Registrar.
