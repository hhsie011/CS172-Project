The CNT based fibers are of interest not only as reinforcements in structural materials with extremely high specific strength and modulus, but also due to their enhanced multi-functionality for use in paper, textiles, and other platforms. Such fibers are currently being researched in the multi-million dollar fiber manufacturing facility in MSE at Georgia Tech. Photonic crystal and other optical fibers are also providing opportunities for use as diagnostic probes as well as for other innovative applications in the telecommunications industry. The faculty listed below, have identified Fibers as one of their primary research areas based on material form.
