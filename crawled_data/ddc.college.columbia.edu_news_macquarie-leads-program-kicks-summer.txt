Each year Macquarie selects eleven DDC high school juniors for the Leadership Education Advancement and Support (LEADS) program, a year round college guidance and summer internship that pairs DDC participants with Macquarie staff mentors as students learn the world of finance at Macquarie’s New York offices. This year Macquarie introduced a new coordinator for the program, Kenrick Fraser, Americas Program Manager, who hopes to work closely with DDC’s College Persistence Initiative to provide additional internships and career opportunities at Macquarie for LEADS alumni.
