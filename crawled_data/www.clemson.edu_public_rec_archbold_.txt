The Center, located in the Commonwealth of Dominica, West Indies, was created in 1989 by a gift to Clemson from the late conservationist and philanthropist John D. Archbold. It was his vision that international students and researchers work with Dominican citizens to address pressing land use concerns. The Archbold Tropical Research and Education Center enables us to study the entire spectrum of ecological, economic, and social factors that influence human relationships with tropical ecosystems.
