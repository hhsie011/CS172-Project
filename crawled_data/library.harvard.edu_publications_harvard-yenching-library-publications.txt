In 1936, the Harvard-Yenching Library began publishing a catalog of its Chinese holdings in order to make its resources better known to a wider scholarly community outside Harvard. Type was set in Peking, and the first three volumes — Confucian Classics, Philosophy and Religion, and Historical Sciences — came off the press in 1938, 1939, and 1940. Unfortunately, the war in the Pacific put a stop to this project, and the remainder of the catalog, though typeset, was never published. Although this project was never resumed after World War II as had originally been planned, several bibliographies based on portions of the library's holdings were subsequently issued.
