These newly established assistantships are designed to attract high-quality applicants into our doctoral programs for fall 2020. Awards will be $25,000/year plus tuition and fee waivers for up 4 years, contingent upon satisfactory academic progress. Departments/programs receiving awards must commit to providing a 1:1 match ($12,500 Graduate School; $12,500 department/program per year for up to 4 years). Departments/programs may have DGSA recipients serve as TAs, RAs, GPTIs, etc., but only at a level of 0.25FTE (e.g., teaching load must be half that of a regular TA/GPTI). Departments/programs may offer stipends above $25,000, but they are 100% responsible for the overage. The Graduate School portion of the DGSA is a 12-month RA appointment. Students may not apply; they must be nominated. The nomination must clearly indicate how the nominee's qualifications rank among top applicants in the discipline (supported by appropriate metrics). Nominations for campus-wide competition and department allocations should be submitted here. **We have currently extended all available DGSA offers for the 2022-2023 academic year. Nominations may still be submitted and evaluated for the waitlist in case additional funding becomes available.** Please note that the process has been revised and all DGSA nominations will be submitted via Saleforce.

Departments/programs, in turn, use these to augment stipends to make tentative offers; department/program provides name of student to the Graduate School at the time of tentative offer. Should a student not accept a tentative offer, the department may "keep" the award until the deadline and use it to recruit another student.
