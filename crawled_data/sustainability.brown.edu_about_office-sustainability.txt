From increasing energy efficiency and reducing emissions to recycling and composting to greener buildings and beyond, Brown’s Office of Sustainability is tasked with helping the University achieve its aggressive sustainability goals. Brown is committed to achieving sustained energy and environmental performance and strategic long-term sustainability through ongoing integrated and systematic approaches. The office is guided by our mission statement: In order to develop sustainable and equitable patterns of global and local resource use, Brown University will minimize its energy use, reduce negative environmental impacts and promote environmental stewardship. Brown will use the opportunities created by these actions to further its educational, research and service missions. The Office of Sustainability works with senior leaders to establish the University's sustainability goals, while working with students, faculty, staff and other partners to achieve them. Our responsibility spans the physical campus — energy efficiency, greenhouse gas reduction, waste reduction and diversion, electric vehicle charging stations or hydration stations — to education efforts that engage the entire Brown community in the University’s sustainability commitments. As this work unfolds, the office continually tracks progress, which is reported in the annual Sustainability Progress Report Update. The Office of Sustainability is supported by eight staff members, as well as a team of undergraduate student interns. For general inquiries, please email sustainability@brown.edu.
