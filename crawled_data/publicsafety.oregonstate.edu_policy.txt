When engaging with the university community, public safety personnel strive to follow an educational model, and be responsive, non-escalatory, restorative and not punitive, whenever possible. We recognize that each person’s experience with public safety and law enforcement personnel differs. OSU public safety personnel will engage with students and university employees by being proactive, helpful, respectful, professional, responsible and willing to listen. We are guided by public safety policies that advance an environment that is welcoming. These policies guide the conduct and operations of all public safety staff in fulfilling the department and university’s mission. All public safety employees are required to comply with these polices. Read the OSU Public Safety Policy Manual The public safety policy manual is a living document and is developed by the university’s Associate Vice President for Public Safety and Corvallis Campus Chief of Police in ongoing dialogue with the community. The policy manual is based on legal and national best practices for university policing and public safety.
