A key element of the renovation was the relocation of the campus greenhouse facility to the top level of the building, which made room for the creation of a direct link of The Walk to the Ruth J. Simmons Quadrangle. The new entry on The Walk (east) side of the building includes an outdoor seating area and new glass into the lower level of the building. This lower level is now a new 70-seat classroom, a greenhouse classroom, and research space. On the first floor, the entry lobby is open with natural light, new seating, and research displays. The 200-seat Carmichael Auditorium on the first floor was fully renovated and the GIS program and classroom space now occupies high-profile space off the improved main lobby. The second/third floors house flexible lab space, research support, and offices. In addition, the project scope of work included a complete mechanical/electrical makeover, elevator replacement, and life safety upgrades. The project achieved a LEED Gold rating from the USGBC.
