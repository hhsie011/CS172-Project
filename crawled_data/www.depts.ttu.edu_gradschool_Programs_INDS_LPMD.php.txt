The LPMD program prepares graduates to be leaders in their community, firms, and organizations with enhanced understanding of multidisciplinary endeavors, improved communication skills between compartmentalized systems of knowledge, and the ability to bring knowledge from one discipline to focus on problems and ongoing projects in another. Graduates of the LPMD become leaders in administrative, legislative, academic, research, design firms, or organizations that deal with land use. Research Areas The inter/transdisciplinary nature of the LPMD program encompasses many research areas. A unifying theme is land and land use. Students with an interest in issues of resiliency, including environmental/natural resource management and planning, community planning and design, public policy administration, and historic preservation are encouraged to work together to take on global challenges involving land use.
