Radcliffe: From College to Institute Responding to calls for equal educational opportunities for women, Harvard President Charles Eliot warned in his 1869 inaugural address that the world “knew next to nothing about the natural mental capacities of the female sex.” In keeping with this belief, he rebuffed attempts to allow women to access a Harvard education. Undeterred, in 1879 a group of reformers founded the Harvard Annex, where women could receive instruction from Harvard faculty. The Annex was soon incorporated as the Society for the Collegiate Instruction of Women under the leadership of Elizabeth Cary Agassiz (1822-1907). A decade later, the Harvard Annex had grown to include more than 200 students and, in 1894, it was chartered as Radcliffe College, with Agassiz as its first president. From the beginning, degrees were countersigned by the Harvard president to attest that they were, in Eliot’s words and despite his reservations, “equivalent in all respects to the degrees given to the graduates of Harvard College.” Some 60 years later, women still faced barriers to educational opportunity. Radcliffe’s fifth president, Mary Ingraham Bunting, a noted microbiologist and educator, gained national prominence soon after joining Radcliffe, when she was featured on the front of Time Magazine. The cover article reported an intellectual crisis underway: “The proportion of girls in college has slipped from 47% in 1920 (a vintage feminist year) to 37% now. Only a little more than half of all college girls get a bachelor's degree. For every 300 women capable of earning a doctorate degree, only one does.” Bunting was among those leaders concerned by what they were witnessing. She memorably remarked, “Adults ask little boys what they want to do when they grow up. They ask little girls where they got that pretty dress.” (Time, Nov 3, 1961). “Adults ask little boys what they want to do when they grow up. They ask little girls where they got that pretty dress.” In order to combat the pervasive “climate of unexpectation” that was undermining the intellectual and creative lives of women, Bunting founded the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study in 1960. So the seed of today’s Harvard Radcliffe Institute was planted. She designed a fellowship program to provide time, financial support, community, access to the University’s resources, and “a room of one's own” to woman scholars and artists. The Institute for Independent Study and Radcliffe College coexisted until 1999, when Radcliffe College and Harvard officially merged, and today's Radcliffe Institute was formally established. The founding dean of the Institute was Drew Gilpin Faust, who led Radcliffe from 2001 until 2007, when she was selected as the first woman to serve as president of Harvard University. The Institute’s work continues to be shaped by this history. Radcliffe’s defining commitment to women and the study of gender endures in the Institute’s programs and the world-class collections of its Schlesinger Library. But the legacy of Radcliffe College is not simply coeducation at Harvard; it is the recognition that universities will always be greater when they draw wisdom and talent from the widest possible pool. This principle has guided Radcliffe’s work for nearly a century and a half.

When Radcliffe College is chartered, Agassiz becomes its first president. 1894 Radcliffe College is chartered by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, named to honor of Ann Radcliffe, Lady Mowlson, who was responsible for establishing Harvard College’s first undergraduate financial aid scholarship fund in 1643. 1903 Le Baron Russell Briggs becomes the second president of Radcliffe. During Briggs’s tenure, the College purchased the Greenleaf estate and added five new dormitories. Before Briggs left office, he wrote, “I believe...Radcliffe will become a women’s college in Harvard, but that neither institution is as yet prepared for such a union.” 1923 Ada Louise Comstock becomes the third—and first full time—president of Radcliffe College. In 1943, Comstock and Harvard’s dean and president reached a Harvard-Radcliffe agreement for joint instruction, which was an important step forward for women at Harvard. The agreement did not, however, require coeducational classes. 1943 Wilbur Kitchener Jordan becomes the fourth president of Radcliffe College. Among his achievements, after Maud Wood Park, Class of 1898, gave her suffrage collection to the College in 1943, Jordan worked with Arthur M. Schlesinger to ensured that these records became the cornerstone of the Women’s Archives at Radcliffe 1943 During World War II, Harvard and Radcliffe sign an agreement opening Harvard classrooms to women students for the first time. 1943 Maud Wood Park's suffrage papers, which were donated in 1943, form the nucleus of the Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America. The Library’s opening ceremonies are held on the 23rd anniversary of the signing of the 19th Amendment. 1960 Mary ("Polly") Ingraham Bunting becomes the fifth president of Radcliffe College. Concerned about the “climate of unexpectation” facing women, Bunting establishes a community of scholars, scientists, and artists known as the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study, later renamed in her honor. 1960 Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is opened to women, and the Radcliffe Graduate School closes. All programs in the Harvard Business School are opened to women, and the Harvard-Radcliffe Program in Business Administration ends. 1970 The first joint Harvard and Radcliffe commencement is held in Harvard Yard. 1972 Matina Souretis Horner becomes the sixth president of Radcliffe College. During her presidency, the Harvard and Radcliffe offices of admissions merge, the quota for women students is abolished, and Harvard Yard is opened to female residents. 1977 Radcliffe and Harvard sign an agreement governing their new educational partnership. 1989 Linda S. Wilson becomes the seventh president of Radcliffe College. As president, Wilson initiates the Radcliffe Research Partnership Program to increase opportunities for undergraduates to work with Radcliffe scholars. The program continues to flourish. 1999 Radcliffe College and Harvard University officially merge, thereby establishing the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard, where individuals pursue advanced learning at its outermost limits and create new knowledge in every field from poetry to biomimetics. Mary Maples Dunn serves as acting dean of the Radcliffe Institute. 2000 Drew Gilpin Faust becomes founding dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. She subsequently serves as the 28th president of Harvard University--the first woman to hold this position. Radcliffe Institute fellowships open to male scholars, scientists, and artists.
