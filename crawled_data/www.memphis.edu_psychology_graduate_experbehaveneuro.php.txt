In pursuit of this objective we use a wide variety of methods including experimental analysis of animal behavior, in vivo and in vitro neurochemical and electrophysiological measures, and psychopharmacological interventions. Select topics of interest include the neurophysiology of drug and alcohol addiction, genetic basis of behavior, neural substrates of spatial and non-spatial memory, executive function, and motivation. Students accepted into this Program will receive broad training in Behavioral and Cellular Neuroscience while satisfying requirements for a PhD in Experimental Psychology. The primary goal of our training program is to prepare graduate students to function in a research-oriented academic environment. Students will begin assisting in ongoing research projects immediately during the first year while working closely with a dedicated faculty advisor to develop individual research projects. Students must complete courses in Behavioral Neuroscience and Psychopharmacology, along with those required by the Experimental Psychology Program. Other relevant neuroscience courses are also offered through different departments on campus. Historically, every doctoral student receives a tuition waiver and monthly stipend. Our graduates have consistently obtained high level post-doctoral fellowships following graduation, and have ascended to positions in academia, industry, and government.
