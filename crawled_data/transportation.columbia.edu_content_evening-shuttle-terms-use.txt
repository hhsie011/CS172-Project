The amended terms, set forth below, do not apply to any paid rides Columbia Evening Shuttle riders choose through the Via app. Paid rides are governed by Via’s standard Terms of Use. Via’s standard Terms of Use are modified as follows for Columbia’s Evening Shuttle riders: Except as herein expressly modified for all Columbia Evening Shuttle rides provided by Via, all terms, conditions and provisions of Via’s standard Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect for Evening Shuttle riders. To the extent of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of the standard Terms of Use and the terms and conditions of this Amendment, the terms and conditions of this Amendment shall govern for any Evening Shuttle ride provided by Via for Columbia University. Such rides will be explicitly identified as “Evening Shuttle” rides at a zero-cost proposal when booking a ride. For the avoidance of doubt, all rides not designated as such shall be subject to the Via’s standard Terms of Use, not subject to any of the modifications set forth herein. Modifications to Via’s standard Terms of Use: Any changes to Via’s standard Terms of Use or Privacy Policy shall not impact these Columbia Evening Shuttle Terms of Use. The second, third and fourth paragraphs of Section II are inapplicable to Columbia Evening Shuttle rides; Via acknowledges that Evening Shuttle riders are not agents of companies, entities or organizations subject to Section III’s paragraph entitled “Agent of a Company, Entity, or Organization”; The provisions of Section V (other than the Cleaning/Damage fees provision) shall not apply to any Columbia Evening Shuttle rides; The language of Section XIV from the beginning through the end of the first sentence under “A. Disclaimer of Warranties” is inapplicable to Columbia Evening Shuttle rides; Section XIV (B) shall be replaced with the following: B. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. A. INDIRECT DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL EVENING SHUTTLE RIDERS OR VIA BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER BY BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY (OR THEIR AGENTS) HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. B. DIRECT DAMAGES.
