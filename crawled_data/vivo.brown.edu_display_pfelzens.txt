Full Text Research Research Overview My primary research interests are in computer vision and artificial intelligence. I am also broadly interested in algorithms. Most of my work is motivated by problems in vision but I am interested in developing techniques that are widely applicable within AI, including to problems in natural language understanding and pattern recognition.
