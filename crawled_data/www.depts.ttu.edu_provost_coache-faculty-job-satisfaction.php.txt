COACHE institutions administer regular job satisfaction surveys to faculty. Texas Tech faculty members have participated in the 2017 and 2019 surveys and are invited to participate in the 2022 survey. Faculty participation makes a difference. Following the 2017 findings, a task force was established to explore and analyze broad patterns in the data to assist with identifying areas in need of improvement and developing plans to address them. Areas identified to be addressed at that time included: leadership (administrator evaluation and accountability); faculty voice and communication (specifically open and transparent communication); and diverse and inclusive working environments (application for and cultivation of diversity and inclusion among Texas Tech faculty). Following the results of the 2019, a team of interdisciplinary researchers secured a National Science Foundation ADVANCE grant. This allows study and implementation of strategies that foster a more equitable, inclusive and diverse environment. About the 2022 survey: No administrator, staff or faculty member outside of Institutional Research or the COACHE Task Force at the University has access to the unit-record data at any time, or at the conclusion of the survey. Participant identities remain confidential. The COACHE Survey takes about 25 minutes to complete. During the week of Feb. 7, 2022, faculty members will receive an email from COACHE (coachefaculty@opinioncast.com) directing them to an online survey. Questions can be directed to the Office of the Provost at provost@ttu.edu.
