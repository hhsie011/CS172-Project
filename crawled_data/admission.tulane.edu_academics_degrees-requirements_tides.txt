Active learning, intellectual challenges, and social co-curricular activities define the TIDES experience. To promote interdisciplinary scholarship, all undergraduates participate in a First-Year Seminar during their first semester at Tulane. These courses bring together small groups of students and faculty to explore academics and the city of New Orleans from an interdisciplinary perspective. With over 125 courses to choose from, there are topics to pique every interest. First-Year Seminars focus on learning by interaction and are driven by intellectual curiosity.
