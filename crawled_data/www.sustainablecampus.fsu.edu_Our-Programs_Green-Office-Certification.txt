In accordance with Goal VI, Excellence and Education, Florida State will incorporate sustainable living practices into all FSU activities. The University will incorporate practices that reduce its overall footprint and build a University-wide culture of environmental care in the following sectors: Climate Action: Reduce greenhouse gas footprint through energy conservation and efficiency. Waste Minimization: Maximize 3Rs principles. Resource Stewardship: Expand commitment to best practices that prioritize the protection of the North Florida ecosystem. Education for Sustainability: Ensure all students have access to sustainability-related learning experiences. With your support, FSU workplaces can reduce resource use, produce less waste, and enjoy cost savings through actionable sustainability measures!

Levels of Certification After your documentation is completed, you will receive one of three designations: Green, Garnet, or Gold! Green Office certification lasts for two years. How does the point system work? The Green Office Check List is a collection of initiatives that make up a more sustainable workplace. Each initiative has a different point value based on the level of behavior change required. 1 point: Initiative promotes education or shares information OR encourages but does not require behavior change. 2 points: Initiative requires behavior change through measurable actions. 3+ points: Initiative requires a culture change of the office system. During Step 3 of the certification process, Green Office Advocates should use the Check List to self-evaluate current office practices. For each initiative, Advocates should identify whether the office is practicing, pursuing, or not pursuing the Check List item based on the guidelines below: Level Description Practicing An action that your office already practices Pursuing An action that your office does partially or plans to implement further in the future Not Pursuing An action that your office does not plan to implement or cannot implement due to any number of constraints INNOVATION POINTS Offices can be recognized for relevant practices that are not included in the checklist through the innovation points system. For any additional innovative action related to sustainability that’s not currently listed on the checklist, your office will receive 3 points (15 points maximum). Examples of innovation points include: The office rents a bed in the Seminole Organic Garden. The Green Fund and related opportunities are utilized by the workplace for sustainability-related collaboration with students and other academic departments.
