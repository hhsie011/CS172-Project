Faces of ILAS” Series Santiago Santiago Center Launches “The Faces of ILAS” Series October 20, 2021 Columbia Global Centers | Santiago has worked with Chilean journalist Muriel Alarcón (JN’20) to define and produce seven 3-minute videos featuring faculty members from the Institute of Latin American Studies (ILAS). “We wanted to highlight the strong relationship between the Santiago Center and ILAS, looking to put a more human touch to some of the faculty members with whom we work,” said Karen Poniachik, Director of the Santiago Center. “The videos will provide a first-hand account of each faculty member’s life, offering a glimpse of their world behind the scenes: how and when they came to Columbia, what drives them, and tidbits of interesting personal and professional information, all within the backdrop of Columbia University in New York City.” “Los Rostros de ILAS” (The Faces of ILAS) videos are in Spanish will be broadcast once a week, every Wednesday beginning October 20, on the social media channels of the Santiago Center and ILAS, under the hashtag #RostrosDeILAS. The first ILAS faculty member to be featured is Vicky Murillo, Director of ILAS and Professor of Political Science and International and Public Affairs. During a tour of Columbia’s Morningside Heights campus, Murillo tells the story of how she became interested in studying economics at a young age and how politics influenced her worldview. From her office at ILAS, she reviews the history of the institute's founding, reflects on the challenges posed by the pandemic, and expresses hope for opportunities of regional collaboration that technology has enabled. Other faculty members to be featured include Elena Cabral, Assistant Dean of Academic Programs and Communications at the Journalism School; Nelson Fraiman, Professor of Operations and Technology Management at the Business School, Pablo Goldberg, Associate Clinical Professor of Psychiatry; Nara Milanich, Professor of History at Barnard, Jorge Otero-Pailos, Professor and Director of Historic Preservation at GSAPP; and Richard Peña, Professor of Film Studies.
