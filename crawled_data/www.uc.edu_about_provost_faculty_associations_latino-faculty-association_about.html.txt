Faculty agreed on the need for a more organized and sustainable group. In Spring 2017, the faculty applied for and received a grant from the Office of Equity & Inclusion to formalize the organization on campus. The 2017-18 academic year will be spent connecting faculty, and laying the foundation for a strong organizational future. If you are interested in becoming more involved, please email LFA@ucmail.uc.edu. Working Mission Statement Create an inclusive environment that values Latinos as an essential component of UC’s diverse community by retaining the Latino talent on our campuses; empowering our members toward action; and attracting future faculty to meet the needs of the rapidly growing young Latino population in the US, Ohio, and the Cincinnati region.
