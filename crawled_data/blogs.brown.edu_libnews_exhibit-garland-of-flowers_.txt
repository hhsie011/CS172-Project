The exhibit displays about two dozen manuscript books, letters, and fragments from the collections in the University Library. These artifacts date from the late 11th to the early 16th centuries, and include original letters of Sixtus IV, and two Spanish kings, as well as a small breviary made for a German nun, and illuminated leaves from a Neapolitan Antiphonal. The exhibit opens Thursday evening April 9 in conjunction with a talk sponsored by the Rhode Island Medieval Circle. Lisa Fagin Davis (Brown class of 1988), Executive Director of the Medieval Academy of America, will speak about “Medieval Manuscripts on College Hill” at 5:30 pm in the Annmary Brown Memorial. A reception will follow the talk, and the exhibit will remain through Commencement weekend. The Annmary Brown Memorial is normally open Monday through Friday, from 1-5 pm.
