About the Week: International Education Week (IEW) is a week of Baylor events that promote and celebrate international exchange worldwide. We aim to encourage communication between different cultures at Baylor and to help develop worldwide leaders to serve. International Education Week contributes significantly to the university's goal of a Global Baylor. The week offers various activities to students, faculty, and staff that promote international exchange, cultural competence, and dialogue. This joint initiative of the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Education is just as crucial amidst current events as ever before. It promotes programs that prepare Americans for a global environment and attract future leaders from abroad to study, learn, and exchange experiences. The Baylor community supports this global initiative to recognize our institution's international community and promote further internationalization among faculty, staff, and students.
