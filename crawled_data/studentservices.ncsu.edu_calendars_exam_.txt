Instructors who give common final examinations should make arrangements for make-up examinations on their courses. These academic calendars are subject to periodic review and revision. Please check with the University Registrar to determine if changes have been made. Students should always verify the time, day, and location of their final exam with their instructor. Three Final Exams in 24 Hours: No student shall be required to take three consecutively scheduled final examinations within any 24-hour period. For example, a student with exams scheduled at 3:30 p.m., 7:00 p.m., and 12:00 p.m. the following day, would not constitute three consecutively scheduled final exams in a 24-hour period. However, if a student has exams scheduled at 3:30 p.m., 7:00 p.m., and 8:30 a.m., that would constitute three consecutively scheduled exams. If you have a conflict with your final exam schedule, you can access the Exam Reschedule tool in MyPack by navigating through the Planning & Enrollment tile. Contact the Student Services Center with questions regarding exam rescheduling. Reexamination for Seniors: A reexamination may be granted to a senior under specific circumstances. Please note: the student’s college dean and the department offering the course must certify and approve the request prior to reexamination. Contact your college dean’s office for instructions on initiating a reexamination request.
