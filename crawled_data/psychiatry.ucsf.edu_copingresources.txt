This site of resources for coping and emotional health has been developed for the benefit of our whole community - UCSF staff, faculty, students, patients, providers, Bay Area families, and the public at large. Please share it with others. We live in challenging times and we must all step up our strategies to maintain our well-being and help one another. We are here to support you. This is an evolving, living website that will continue to be updated to respond to the emerging demands of our modern era (pandemics, climate crises, and personal crises). Our UCSF faculty offer their best advice and resources on how to maintain good mental health during crisis. We are all flooded with information and advice, so we have curated the information for you and your loved ones, and provided links to online wellness resources, prioritizing those that are free. If you have suggestions for additional content, please let us know us at [email protected]. Medical information about COVID-19 can be found at coronavirus.ucsf.edu. Protecting your own wellness will also help those around you. Together we can become a more stress resilient community during difficult periods. Stay well and safe. With warm regards, UCSF Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences A note to frontline providers Those of you who are working with patients need extra support. Further resources for UCSF community members can be found at coronavirus.ucsf.edu/emotional-health-wellbeing-resources. UCSF Health faculty, staff, and learners can also request to speak with a trained peer supporter to help you or your team through the Caring for the Caregiver Program. The San Francisco VA Health Care System has also assembled a comprehensive mental health resource list for health care providers, including these quick self-care tips for you as a provider and as a human being. You can see videos from our monthly webinar series. Many patients are come to non-mental health clinical settings to report mental health issues (e.g., anxiety, insomnia). In addition, during times of crises we see an increase in interpersonal violence and alcohol/drug misuse. Here are some resources and recommendations for your patients: Conduct an Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) screening at each clinical visit Provide interpersonal violence resources to all women in the after visit summary Provide self-management tools for anxiety and insomnia As health care providers, we know that you may be struggling yourself with these issues. Please remember how important it is to care for yourself as well during this difficult time.
