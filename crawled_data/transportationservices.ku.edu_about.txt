We manage parking and help control traffic on campus to create a safe environment for pedestrians, bikers and vehicles. In collaboration with the City of Lawrence, we provide bus service on campus and around town. We operate a late-night, on-demand ride service to help students get home safely. Transit Commission KU Transportation Services works with the KU Transit Commission to set policy, guidelines and procedures related to transportation on campus.
