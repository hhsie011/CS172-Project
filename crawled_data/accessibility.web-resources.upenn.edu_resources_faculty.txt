Get Help Report issues or Give Feedback Schedule Training or Consultation Resources For Faculty For Faculty All students must be able to obtain information fully, equally, and independently, regardless of disability. Faculty are key to ensuring this is possible. When creating electronic instructional materials, such as slides, documents, or videos, implement these standards to ensure an inclusive learning environment. Review the Universal Design for Learning Guidelines for a great foundation on how to make your classroom accessible to all learners. Electronic Documents Text appearance: Use standard, non-decorative fonts. Use at least 12 point font size. Use at least 1.4 line-spacing. Avoid use of light color text. Content: Avoid using color as a way of coding information. For example, "See the highlighted text at the bottom of this page." Include alternative text for all images, or mark images as decorative if they do not provide additional context. Be descriptive with links and avoid titling links "click here." Structure: Use headings in your word processor's formatting pane to structure your content. Do this instead of making your text larger and bolder from the styling pane. Break up large paragraphs of text with bullet lists and headings. Go to Accessible Documents for more information and resources.
