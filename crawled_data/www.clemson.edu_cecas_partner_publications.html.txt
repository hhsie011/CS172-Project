Magazine Outreach Ways to Give Clemson Home College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences Current: Connect College Priorities Pursuing Greatness None of us can predict the potential unleashed when someone first stares into an electron microscope, sees her sketches transformed into a shelter, hears his first engine design roar to life, or watches a patient walk again. Nor can we predict the impact on our economy, our state, and ultimately, our world. Today Clemson finds itself in the enviable position of being poised and ready for even more. We are pursuing greatness. We are furthering success. We are education leaders, critical thinkers, and global citizens. We are transforming ourselves into one of the nation's best public institutions.

The first building in the neighborhood will be a multi-tenant 40,000-square-foot high-bay facility supported by $2 million in funding from the U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA). The building is designed to accommodate new and growing companies in the Upstate. The building aims to fill a void in the local real estate market for high-quality multi-purpose facilities that can accommodate a range of businesses, from startup companies to established firms in the automotive, transportation, manufacturing, and engineering support service industries. View Project Leading Research and Education Centers From innovation campuses to high-tech classrooms, our facilities have a direct impact on the state of South Carolina. Faculty and students can partner with industry researchers to apply knowledge from the classroom with real-world data to produce groundbreaking technology. Center & Institutes Student Engagement Lauren Davis Researching Mesh Implants Lauren Davis, a Beckman Scholar, is researching mesh implants used in hernia-repair and organ prolapse surgery. Her focus is on why mesh sometimes needs to be removed for medical reasons. As part of the research, she asks, "Is it brittle? Did it shrink? What happened to the mesh while implanted in the body?" View Lauren's Story Autonomous Vehicle Technology Developing a high-speed, self-driving, open-wheel racecar Through Deep Orange, one of Clemson’s flagship programs, automotive engineering students will collaborate with industry leaders; students will gain unique hands-on experience and expertise that lead to successful careers after graduation. The project aims to advance driverless technology for passenger cars and equip Clemson automotive engineering graduates with direct experience in the field. Students develop comprehensive technical knowledge in design and development and valuable interpersonal skills often overlooked in traditional engineering programs.
