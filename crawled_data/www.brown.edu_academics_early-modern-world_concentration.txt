Sub Navigation In This Section Current Courses Honors Program Concentration & Courses The Early Modern World concentration promotes interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approaches to historical cultures around the world between the waning of feudalism and the arrival of global industrial capitalism, from the 1300s to the end of the 1800s. Students take courses in a wide range of departments and with faculty affiliated with the Center for the Study of the Early Modern World. Concentrators have the opportunity to be mentored by faculty, staff at the special collections libraries at Brown, and graduate students working on contiguous topics. Students are invited to take advantage of this breadth of offerings to enhance their understanding of the period, as well as to gain a sense of the uses, limitations, and interrelationships of particular disciplinary approaches. Concentration Requirements Concentrators are required to take a minimum of eight courses: Three courses on early modern topics in one field in which the student has primary interest or training — e.g., literature, history of art and architecture, history. Three courses related to the early modern period chosen from two other fields. A senior project of which possible examples might be: 1) a senior thesis (roughly equivalent to a senior seminar paper); 2) the staging of an early modern play; 3) the performance of early modern music; or 4) an exhibition. The final project will be developed in consultation with two faculty advisors who work closely with the student. Credit will be granted through registration for Independent Study in the department for which the topic of research lies. Other relevant courses of the student’s choosing. In addition, the student must be able to demonstrate a reading knowledge of a relevant modern or ancient language other than English. This language requirement does not count as one of the eight courses. Concentration Courses Listed below are sample courses regularly offered in various departments. Students interested in 2000-level courses must obtain the instructor's permission before enrolling.
