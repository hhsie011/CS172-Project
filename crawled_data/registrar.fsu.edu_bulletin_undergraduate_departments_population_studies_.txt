Taylor (Sociology), J. Taylor (Sociology), Tillman (Sociology); Associate Professors: McFarland (Sociology), Waggonner (Sociology); Assistant Professors: Felkner (Urban and Regional Planning), Hauer (Sociology); Professors Emeriti: Eberstein, Nam This multidisciplinary minor provides an overview of population studies, a field that is concerned with the size, composition, and distribution of human populations—globally, nationally, and locally—and with how and why these characteristics change. Populations change in response to fertility, mortality, and migration, but contemporary population research stretches the field beyond these three variables to encompass a broad range of related topics, including family structure, health, the environment, and socioeconomic development. Through the coursework for this minor, students will realize the impact of population variables and processes on nearly every issue of public concern, including population aging, rising health care costs, national security, the economy, and climate change. A minor in population studies will complement majors in the College of Social Sciences and Public Policy, but students in other majors, including Environmental Sciences and Policy, will find it useful as well. Requirements The minor in Population Studies consists of fifteen semester hours of coursework comprising nine hours of required coursework and six hours of electives.
