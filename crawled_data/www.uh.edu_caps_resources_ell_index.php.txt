They may be: U.S.-born students who grew up in homes where a non-English language was spoken Foreign-born students who grew up in the U.S., who were educated in this country, and who also grew up in homes where a non-English language was spoken Newly arrived immigrant students who were schooled in other countries International students (Adapted from the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching) There are different proficiency levels that can determine the amount of help you will need. Good oral English does not mean that English is mastered, and you may need help with sentence structure, grammar, vocabulary and idioms that are difficult to understand. Since it is difficult to design a course for just one student given the different linguistic backgrounds and proficiencies, the Language and Culture Center (LLC) can help you evaluate where the most help is needed. Additionally, they arrange student activities and help you adjust to the on-campus culture. The University of Houston Writing Center may also be able to assist you in editing your coursework and learning the rules of the English language.
