We need to do our part toward reducing energy consumption. Achieving this goal will require accelerating the implementation of energy conservation projects, targeting older and less efficient buildings for deep retrofits, and ensuring all new buildings meet the UW Green Building Standard to minimize water and energy consumption. The expanded use of utility metering and monitoring based commissioning will keep buildings operating optimally. Status updates Quarterly status reports FY2022 1st Quarter (Summer 2021) FY2021 3rd & 4th Quarter (Winter & Spring 2020) FY2021 2nd Quarter (Fall 2020) FY2021 1st Quarter (Summer 2020) Target actions for FY2021 Action: Implement Cost Effective Conservation Investments Responsible party : UW Facilities Asset Management FY 2021 steps: Execute 17 minor conservation projects in 32 campus buildings avoiding an estimated $1 million annual utility cost (starting mid FY22). Estimated capital cost will be $3.2M, of which $1.6 million can be recovered in utility rebates. Begin initial design, permitting and equipment procurement for a Phase II expansion of the West Campus Utility Plant. This project will pilot seasonal hot water energy transfer to a select group of high-EUI buildings in west and south campus, using a new, 1,300 ton heat recovery chiller. Conduct in-house energy engineering analysis in coordination with the One Capital Plan and other initiatives to identify one or more co-funding opportunities for a major renovation or deep retrofit in FY2022-FY2023, that can support future revolving fund revenues. See the full details Action: Expand Campus Meter Monitor O&M Program. Responsible party: UW Facilities Asset Management FY 2021 steps: Fund $250k to purchase, configure, and document equipment, and train UW Facilities operators. Existing staff time will be turned toward new information technology hardware and software per May 11, 2020 recommendations by the UW Meter Monitor Team. Operationalize the Meter Monitor Program’s “MBCx process“ in seven additional campus buildings. Fund $250k in on-going annual program operations & maintenance, hire a Meter Monitor Program Manager, operationalize MBCx process in 14 buildings by end of FY2021. Conduct analysis for future Meter Monitor investment strategy, including investments in additional steam and water meters at all state funded buildings. See the full details Action: Purchase Only Energy Star Appliances Responsible party: Procurement Services and UW Facilities Finance & Administration FY 2021 steps: Develop regular communications highlighting Procurement guidelines for Energy Star purchasing requirements. Develop annual reporting for Energy Star appliances. Work with UW Facilities and HFS to promote Energy Star appliances for all new buildings.
