Many acceptable in-person proctors around the world are closed or unavailable indefinitely. For proctored exams, we recommend using Proctorio since it is a free, online proctoring option. If you are not in an area currently experiencing closures, please contact your proctor directly to confirm they will be able to proctor your exams before submitting them as your proctor. For more up-to-date information, keep an eye on the Ecampus proctoring website. Can I still access resources at the Valley Library?
