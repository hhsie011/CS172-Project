The recommended course sequence represents the courses and the order that certain courses should be taken to promote student success and degree completion. To understand all degree requirements for a major degree program, it is important to refer to the Texas Tech Undergraduate Catalog for information specific to each degree and to contact an academic advisor. These plans do not constitute an official degree plan, but rather serve as a tool for proactive discussion as students plan for registration and timely degree completion with an academic advisor. Students should always confirm their course selections with an academic advisor to avoid taking unnecessary or repeated courses. To connect with an academic advisor, visit the University Advising website or the academic advising office specific to the degree program.
