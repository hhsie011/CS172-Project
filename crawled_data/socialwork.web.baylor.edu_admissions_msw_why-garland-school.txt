At the Garland School, we believe social work is about service and justice, healing and restoration, and the dignity of each individual. Through innovative academics and experiential learning opportunities, we strive to train and equip social work professionals to support the needs of clients through the ethical integration of faith & practice. Students at GSSW are challenged by expert faculty members, rigorous curriculum and outstanding peer cohorts in an environment that allows every student to select a community that will allow them to thrive as they complete their coursework. Gabby White, MSW candidate— “I chose social work because helping people from a social justice standpoint drew me in, and I chose Baylor Social Work because the integration of faith and practice showed me that I could bring all parts of me to the profession.” Integration of faith and practice Integration of faith and practice is a competency woven throughout the curriculum and classroom experience through conversations with faculty and peers. The GSSW welcomes students from all faith backgrounds and prepares them to become practitioners who can ethically integrate faith into their professional practice. Faculty mentorship and research opportunities GSSW faculty are renowned, expert leaders in the field of social work, have a passion for sharing knowledge with the students of the GSSW, and lead by example in and out of the classroom. They model servant leadership and offer students a unique opportunity through mentorship. Faculty mentors are resources for students as they navigate the MSW program. Mentors often continue beyond graduation to develop professional relationships as colleagues with their mentees. Students also have the opportunity to partner with faculty on research through specialization projects, throughout their MSW experience. Small, lively classes The GSSW student-to-professor ratio is 10:1, and the average class size is 15 students, which translates into an environment of active, meaningful learning. The size and style of classes offered at the GSSW give students the opportunity to connect with classmates and professors on a deeper level. Just like in the field and across the world, professors and students come from all walks of life and bring their own unique perspectives into the learning environment. Our classes allow for deep engagement, lively discussion and true connection with each other. Joint degree options The GSSW partners with departments at the university to provide joint degree options that allow students to connect their passions. Joint degrees are offered at our Waco campus in partnership with Baylor’s Hankamer School of Business and George W. Truett Theological Seminary. Degrees offered include: MSW/MBA, MSW/MDiv, MSW/MTS.
