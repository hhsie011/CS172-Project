As the world is opening back up and in order to help keep alumni and friends of Brown safe, we are providing the following guidance for those who might be organizing an in-person alumni gathering, and we request that you follow these guidelines closely: When hosting an event, it is important that your potential guests understand the parameters of the health and safety measures guests will be expected to abide by in order to attend the event. We advise providing information on the expectations for vaccinated and unvaccinated attendees including what the event mask policy will be in the event marketing emails and on the event registration form. Your policies should follow local health guidelines and CDC guidelines. If you are hosting an in-person event, please make sure to track who registered for and attended the event including their email information. All event invitations should also include the following statement: “Any individual who has tested positive for COVID-19, is waiting for COVID-19 test results, is showing COVID-19 symptoms, or has had close contact with a person who has tested positive for or who has symptoms of COVID-19 is kindly asked not to attend.” For Brown community members local to the Brown campus area and who wish to explore opportunities for on-campus programming, please note that there are specific policies in place for campus visitors. Please reach out to your staff liaison to make arrangements for your event on campus.
