PubMed Research Research Overview The focus of our research is to evaluate the mechanisms underlying vascular, cardiac, and skeletal muscle dysfunction seen in pulmonary vascular diseases. The laboratory uses a variety of in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo approaches utilizing the preclinical models of pulmonary hypertension and emphysema. In clinical research, we are attempting to characterize the role and impact of cardiac dysfunction in settings of lung diseases, and study the epidemiology of pulmonary hypertension. Research Statement Pulmonary hypertension is a disease associated with increased morbidity and mortality in general population. Few studies have evaluated the epidemiology of pulmonary hypertension in community-based population. We are investigating the epidemiology of pulmonary hypertension in a community-based population and in the VA cohorts. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is associated with pulmonary vascular remodeling and endothelial dysfunction. We have been evaluating role of endothelial ion channels in mediating endothelial dysfunction, pulmonary vasoconstriction and pulmonary vascular remodeling. We are evaluating endothelial ion channels as potential therapeutic targets in pulmonary hypertension. Right ventricular dysfunction and failure is the cause of mortality associated with pulmonary hypertension. Furthermore, right ventricular dysfunction is associated with worse prognosis in a number of cardiopulmonary diseases. We have been investigating right ventricular function in clinical cohorts as well as animal models of pulmonary hypertension. Exercise intolerance is frequently associated with pulmonary hypertension. Using preclinical models, we are investigating the mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle dysfunction in pulmonary hypertension with particular focus on mitochondrail metabolism.
