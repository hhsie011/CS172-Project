We know that you want the very best, and we would like to help you consider the options. A summary of annual fees and alternative payment and federal loan options offered by Barnard are available. In planning your budget, please note meal plan requirements for resident students. These requirements are outlined in "Terms and Conditions of Residence Hall Living." Please note that Dining Dollars alone are not considered a meal plan. For students to avoid a progressive late payment fee, invoices for the Fall term will be available the week of July 5 online in the Bursar Student Account Center (BSAC) for payment by December 3rd. If you prefer not to pay Spring tuition and fee charges in full by the semester deadlines of December 3rd, we offer monthly payment plans that may offer you a realistic and attractive alternative. Please apply before the deadline to avoid Barnard's escalating late payment fees. (The Spring semester five-month plans begin on December 3rd, you must enroll by the payment deadline. Note that late fees will be assessed by the College after the deadline.) If you are interested in applying for a Federal Direct Stafford Student Loan or a Federal Direct PLUS (Parent) loan, you may obtain information and applications from Barnard's Financial Aid Office.

Domestic Payment Plans For 2021-2022, Barnard’s payment plan (five monthly payments due on the first of each month) is administered by a third party, Nelnet. There is a $50 fee each semester for enrolling in the service. *You must enroll in the plan each term. For example, your Fall enrollment does not automatically transfer to the Spring term.* Note that Nelnet does not adjust the amount you budget without your specific instructions. (If you wish to increase/decrease your budget to cover Barnard charges, you must advise Nelnet.) If you enroll in the Nelnet plan before issuing your e-bill, your plan will already be deducted from Barnard's invoice. If our e-bill still shows a balance after the deduction for Nelnet, your plan does not cover all charges.

Tuition Refund Plan To protect your financial investment against the student's serious illness or accident resulting in the withdrawal of the student before a semester is completed, consider the optional Tuition Refund Plan.

Subscribers are assured a refund throughout the term even though Barnard's refund policy may have expired at the time of withdrawal. If you enroll in this optional plan, you are assured of an 80% refund of covered charges for medical withdrawals. For more information on this optional program, visit www.collegerefund.com.
