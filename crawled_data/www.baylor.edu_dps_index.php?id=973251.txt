Baylor Faculty and Staff are provided parking access at no charge. A visit to the Parking Services offices is required to set up the virtual permit. Vehicles must be parked in areas/spaces that correspond with their permit. Faculty and Staff permits allow for parking in faculty and staff designated areas. These areas are typically designated by signs with the letters "F/E". Under overflow situations, employees may park in student designated spaces. (This does NOT include the Student 5th Street Garage area or the Student 8th Street Garage area). Authorization to park in special areas can only be granted by written permission from Parking and Transportation Services. Most permits are virtual with no physical permit/sticker and are tied to the vehicle's license plate. A vehicle's LICENSE PLATE MUST BE CORRECT. JUST 1 NUMBER OR LETTER BEING INCORRECT OR OUT OF PLACE WILL RESULT IN CITATIONS AND TOWING. Permit owners are responsible for updating their vehicle information if they get a different vehicle, different license plate number or temporarily drive a different vehicle to campus. License plates (rear or front) must be easily visible to the parking lot aisle/roadway. License plates displayed behind objects (bicycle racks, bumper guards) or on a vehicle dashboard are not acceptable. Parking permits are transferable from the permit owner's vehicle to another vehicle in their possession. The permit is NOT transferable from person to person. Vehicle Updates Faculty and Staff register their vehicle(s) online in their My Parking Account (blue button). Login with your Bear ID and Password. Multiple vehicles may be entered. Temporary or paper ‘dealer’ plates should be used until permanent/metal plates arrive. Temporary vehicles (including family vehicles or rental vehicles) should be added to My Parking Account and then removed when no longer parking on campus. If an existing vehicle receives a new license plate, create a NEW vehicle as the license plate on a vehicle cannot be edited/updated. Then delete the vehicle with the old plate from your account.
