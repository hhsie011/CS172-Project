Social Dimensions of Evolution in Africa: The Cradle Paradox AFST S200 (CRN: 30201) Instructors: Dates: H5A Meeting Times: Distributional Requirements: YCSO Course Cancelled. Africa as the cradle of humanity is a widely accepted theory in scientific studies. Elsewhere nationalist archaeology has been used to bolster nationalism and facilitate state building. Africans, while embracing their recent history, have a marked disconnect to the cradle paradigm. A paradox thus arises out of the fact that the cradle of humanity status of Africa appears to hold no special place in the psyche of most of its inhabitants. This course examines symbolism, colonialism, poverty, media, literacy, and religion as agencies that distance the ‘humanity cradle’ status of Africa from nationalist and identity discourses. 1 Credit.

Race, Gender, and Sexuality in Asian American Popular Culture AMST S251 (CRN: 30132) Instructors: Najwa Mayer Dates: H5B Meeting Times: TTh 6.00-9.15p Distributional Requirements: YCSO Online Course. From film, TV, and social media to the fringe punk scenes in between, this course explores the politics of contemporary “Asian American” popular cultures. What are the relationships between modern politics and consumption, between social movements and cultural media? Using critical race, feminist, and queer studies methods, we consider the tense intersections between consumer cultures, media technologies, global Asian/American markets, and resistant social movements. We ask historical questions about power, representation, capital, and access, all with close attention to shifting categories of race, gender, sexuality, class, and trans/nationalism. Ultimately, popular cultures—the radical, the joyful, and the terrible—will be our guide. 1 Credit. Technology Fee: $85. Tuition: $4,650. Session B: July 4 - August 5.
