An engaged and informed public is central to our mission to glean knowledge that alleviates human suffering caused by disease. For this reason, each year, Harvard Medical School hosts a media fellowship. The week-long “immersion” program allows a group of reporters to spend time on our campus and in our affiliated hospitals and institutes to gain a deeper understanding of the spectrum of research being done in a particular area. The Harvard Medical School Office of Communications and External Relations can assist with inquiries related to biomedical science and research throughout the Harvard Medical School community. We can help you locate experts in basic, translational and clinical research, as well as help you obtain more information regarding recent news. Please contact us to arrange for an interview, photo shoot, or video taping.
