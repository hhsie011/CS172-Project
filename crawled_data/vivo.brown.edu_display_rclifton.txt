Hawkins University Professor Emeritus of Engineering, Professor of Engineering (Research) Overview Brown Affiliations Engineering Research Areas engineering | mechanical behavior | methodology Research Research Overview Professor Clifton's primary research is on the mechanical response of materials at very high loading rates. Applications include: high speed machining, armor penetration, shear band formation, martensitic phase transformations, elastohydrodynamic lubrication, and dynamic fracture. Principal experimental approach is pressure-shear plate impact. A second research focus involves the measurement of the high frequency, viscoelastic response of soft, biological tissues, especially vocal folds. Research Statement Beginning with Harry Kolsky (deceased) and continuing with Jacques Duffy (deceased) and Rod Clifton, Brown investigators have led the development of the experimental methodologies for studying the mechanical behavior of materials at high strain rates. The torsional Kolsky bar and the pressure-shear plate impact experiment developed at Brown are widely used to study the deformation and failure of materials at the high strain rates that occur in high speed machining, terminal ballistics, and explosive loading. Professor Clifton's group conducts research on the mechanical response of materials subjected to very high loading rates. This research is motivated by the need for better understanding of such processes as high speed machining, armor penetration, shear band formation, martensitic phase transformations, elastohydrodynamic lubrication, and dynamic fracture. The research involves combined experimental and computational investigations in which the experimental component makes use of plane wave loading to provide the most direct interpretation of the experimental results in terms of the response of the material. Pressure shear plate impact: Plane waves are generated in a plate impact facility, which is designed to produce the impact of parallel plates. In order to subject the impacting plates to combined pressure and shear loading, the impacting plates are inclined relative to the direction of approach. The motion of the rear surface of the impacted plate is recorded using a variety of laser interferometers. Computer simulation of the experiment is used to relate the recorded velocity-time profiles to the response of the material being studied. Scope: Studies have been conducted on a wide variety of materials including metals, metal alloys, glasses, ceramics, ceramic powders, lubricants, and shape memory alloys. In addition, studies have been conducted on the dynamic friction of sliding interfaces, such as the interface between a machine tool and the stock being machined. Recently, an induction heater has been added that makes it possible to conduct the experiments at temperatures up to 700 degrees C. Experiments can also be conducted in a so-called "soft recovery" configuration in which the specimen is recovered after being subjected to a single plane pulse -- thereby making it possible to relate the dislocation motion or microcracking that occurred to the action of a known stress pulse. Current projects: Current research projects are concerned with the modeling of martensitic phase transformation, dynamics failure of steel welds, dynamics plasticity of refractory metals, dislocation mobility in Ni 3 Al, and the competition between shear banding and shear fracture in the dynamic failure of materials.
