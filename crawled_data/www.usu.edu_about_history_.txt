These schools were to promote higher education and practical learning to people of all classes and walks of life, especially rural life. In 1888, the Agricultural College of Utah was founded as the state's land-grant institution. Though it grew to become Utah State University in 1957, the university has remained true to its roots as an institution dedicated to the land and its people. With the land-grant distinction, USU has the responsibility to "educate the state," and it continues to maintain a presence in every county in Utah. Through academic and research prowess, athletic success, and unparalleled student experience, USU's rich history and traditions color who we are today. 1888 The Agricultural College of Utah (UAC) is founded on March 8. Two years later, 14-year-old Miss Vendla Berntson enrolls as the Agricultural College of Utah's first student. 1892 The "Farmers" of UAC defeat the University of Utah 12-0 in the first football game, and athletic event, in school history. The game is played on what is now the USU quad. 1894 The first eight students receive business degrees, making USU home to the oldest continuously operating business school in the West. The Jon M. Huntsman School of Business counts Deloitte CEO Jim Quigley among its alumni. 1899 The Alumni Association is organized. 1900 1901 Blue is adopted as the official school color, and is used by the first women's basketball team, which will predate a men's team by three years. 1902 Students publish the first campus newspaper, Student Life. The name is changed to the Utah Statesman in 1978. 1907 Fearing that the growth of the UAC will hinder the University of Utah's progress, legislators in Salt Lake City attempt to consolidate the two schools, and upon failing, instead pass a bill limiting UAC's curriculum to agriculture, domestic science, and mechanic arts. Many once-thriving programs in the arts, humanities, education, and others are closed, despite the college's initial mandate that it offer such instruction. By 1927, all curricular restrictions except law and medicine are lifted. 1907 Students meet in the Old Main Chapel on October 26 to organize the first student government. 1907 Rooted in rural education, professors travelled by train from Logan to provide new information and techniques to rural residents. 1909 The "A" of Old Main, the school's first senior gift, is installed on the tower's west face. The "A" light, later extended to all four sides of the tower, shines white each night, and blue for special campus events and significant athletic victories. 1910 The first volume of the student yearbook, the Buzzer, is published. It persisted through 1971. 1911 The first correspondence study courses are organized. Curriculum included agricultural and general education courses. Residents of Brigham City, Northern Utah and Idaho took part. 1914 As part of the school's land-grant mission, the Utah Cooperative Extension Service is founded, bringing research-based knowledge to people, especially farmers, around the state. UAC grants its first graduate degree, a master's in agriculture. The first doctoral degrees are awarded in 1950. USU Cooperative Extension runs Utah's 4-H program, which teaches science, engineering, technology, healthy living, and citizenship to almost 90,000 youths across the state. 1914 The Be-No Club erects the block "A," which can now be found between the quad and Old Main. Tradition holds that in order to become a "True Aggie," one must receive a kiss atop the "A" at midnight on either Homecoming or A-Day, or by kissing a current True Aggie at midnight under any full moon. 1918 Campus is temporarily transformed into a military institution, with enlisted students housed in numerous new barracks around the quad. The buildings, which will be converted into classroom and laboratory space after the war, essentially double the size of campus. Meanwhile, the Spanish Flu epidemic necessitates a campus-wide quarantine and the establishment of a hospital in the north wing of Old Main. The popular spirit song "The Scotsman" is composed by a student. 1921 Aggie Ice Cream introduced by Gustav Wilster. Eating Aggie Ice Cream has become a rite of passage on campus. 1923 The National Summer School is founded at UAC, bringing in Knute Rockne, Frederick Jackson Turner, and other distinguished faculty from Harvard, Stanford, Columbia, and elsewhere. The success of the program, which lasts three summers, is partially responsible for influencing the state legislature to reverse the curricular restriction in 1927 and award UAC full state college status in 1929. 1928 The newly launched School of Education establishes a teacher training school, what is now called the Edith Bowen Laboratory School. The Emma Eccles Jones College of Education and Human Services ranks #8 in the nation among public universities for total research dollars received by a college. 1929 The Utah Agricultural College (UAC) is renamed the Utah State Agricultural College. 1930 The first Homecoming game and festivities are held on October 11. 1933 "Hail the Utah Aggies" is first written and performed in 1933. 1936 Three students are named Rhodes Scholars in three years (1936-1938). 1940s World War II has a profound effect on campus. The war decimated student enrollments, which declined from 3,641 during the 1940-41 school year to 1,129 in the '43-'44 school year to only 861 students for fall 1944. The physical face of campus changes as well. In preparation for the Army Specialized Training Program, the Field House is modified to serve as a barracks. 1950 1951 The institution initiates its first international program at Kardj College in Iran. 1957 Utah State Agricultural College becomes Utah State University. 1959 Two of the most respected research institutions in the West, the Space Dynamics Laboratory and the Utah Water Research Laboratory, are founded in the same year at USU. USU has sent more student experiments into space than any other university in the world and has also produced many of the world's leading experts on water issues, including the current governor of the World Water Council. 1961 Led by future Hall of Famer Merlin Olsen, the Utah State Aggie football team finishes at #10 in the nation, its highest year-end ranking. The football field at former Romney Stadium was dedicated as Merlin Olsen Field in 2010. 1965 In one of the greatest tragedies to befall the university, star basketball player Wayne Estes is killed on February 8, hours after scoring 48 points in a victory against the University of Denver. At the time of his death, he is the nation's second leading scorer, and the Los Angeles Lakers are planning to select him in the first round of the NBA draft. He is posthumously awarded first team All-American honors. Under former head coach Stew Morrill, USU enjoys the fourth-highest winning percentage in the nation, after Duke, Kansas, and Gonzaga. 1967 The first statewide campuses are established.Representatives Daniel Dennis, Ralph A Preece, Chilean Halladay working with Alva Snow, jointly sponsored a bill to establish Utah State University education centers in Roosevelt and Moab. Classes began fall term of 1967 in Roosevelt. 1970 The Smith Spectrum hosts its first men's basketball game on December 1, against Ohio State. 1975 The university initiates its Undergraduate Research Program, making it the second oldest program in the nation, behind MIT. Because undergraduates work under the supervision of USU's top research faculty, many have been able to publish work in professional journals. 1976 USU purchases a live white bull to act as a mascot for sporting events and painted it blue before each game. Despite being fitted with large rubber boots, the damage the bull causes to the Smith Spectrum and Romney Stadium becomes too great to overlook, and the bull is retired a short while later. The current Big Blue mascot is introduced in 1987. 1978 Utah State Aggie Athletics crowns its first national champions as the women's volleyball team defeats UCLA in the national final and finishes 40-4 on the year. 1985 USU Research and Technology Park is founded north of campus. It will later be renamed Innovation Campus and will support the research of private companies engaged in projects with student researchers and faculty. 1997 A fire that destroyed the south wing of Old Main in 1983 led to an extensive renovation project that took 14 years to complete. The historic building is completed and rededicated in October. 2000 2003 USU initiates its first capital campaign for $400 million. In a short period of time, the university receives the three largest private gifts in its history. 2006 The new Merrill-Cazier Library is dedicated on April 14 and immediately begins to receive national recognition, including #1 in the "Smart Classroom Category" from Campus Technology. In 2006, students gather in the library's main foyer to relieve their stress vocally during the inaugural "Finals Week Howl." 2010 In the state of Utah's first-ever merger of two longstanding academic institutions, the College of Eastern Utah joins forces with USU. USU Eastern in Price operates as a comprehensive community college offering both technical certificates and academic degrees. 2013 USU alumnus Lars Peter Hansen, received the 2013 Nobel Prize in Economics. Hansen graduated from USU in 1974 with bachelor’s degrees in both mathematics and political science and a minor in economics. 2016 First-time students were able to take part in the first luminary procession prior to the start of classes in the fall of 2016. This tradition, part of the USU 1010: Connections experience, has become one of the most celebrated rites of passage for incoming students. 2017 Noelle Cockett was appointed as USU’s 16th president, and her official tenure began in January 2017. In addition to becoming the institution’s first female president, she has prioritized diversity and inclusion throughout USU’s statewide system. 2021 The Latinx Cultural Center opened in October 2018 to increase education, training, and mentoring opportunities for Latinx students. In 2021, the center welcomed students to a new, centralized location in the Taggert Student Center. Want to learn more about USU?
