He has been a member of the Brown faculty since 1989. He has a master's degree in Biological Sciences from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina, and a Ph.D. degree from the Hadassah Medical School, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel, where he studied the Biochemistry of Parasitic Protozoa. Dr. Nillni completed his post-doctoral fellowship in membrane biology of parasitic protozoa at Tufts-New England Medical Center in Boston, and he then became a member of the faculty in 1984. He subsequently shifted his research to the field of Neuroendocrinology and Cell Biology when he moved to Brown University. Since then he has studied the role of neuropeptide hormones and nutrient sensors in the hypothalamus interacting with the adiposite hormone leptin and other vital components of the regulatory system controlling food intake energy homeostasis. His recent textbook, "Textbook of Energy Balance, Neuropeptide Hormones, and Neuroendocrine Function" (Springer International), represents a vast body of the latest knowledge in the field of neuropeptides and their action on energy balance. It contains a detailed and comprehensive account of certain specific hypothalamic peptides controlling energy balance and food intake. Dr. Nillni had made substantial contributions to the neurobiology of neuropeptide hormones controlling energy balance. His laboratory has produced seminal work in demonstrating that the biosynthesis of neuropeptide hormones from their pro-hormones is nutritionally regulated. These nutritional changes affect the activity of the Pro-hormone Convertases 1 and 2 (PC1 And PC2) essential in the maturation of all pro-hormones. Most of his studies focused on pro-Thyrotropin Releasing Hormone (pro-TRH) and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) polypeptides directly involved in energy homeostasis. He has described how different hormones and neurotransmitters including leptin, α-MSH, Norepinephrine (NE), and thyroid hormone regulate pro-TRH at transcriptional, protein biosynthesis, and secretion levels in the hypothalamus. The universal finding derived from these studies demonstrated that besides affecting TRH transcription and pro-TRH biosynthesis, leptin, NE, α-MSH, and thyroid hormone also affect the maturation of PC1 and PC2. This tightly regulated mechanism to produce biologically active peptides turns out to be true for most peptide hormones produced in the hypothalamus. A breakthrough study from his laboratory in the biology of leptin was that aside from regulating peptide hormone expression, leptin also controls pro-hormone processing by regulating PC1 and PC2. This novel concept was introduced in 2004 to the obesity field, which provided the basis for many studies conducted today in other laboratories. His laboratory in collaboration with his colleagues at Harvard University also demonstrated for the first time that leptin regulates the TRH and POMC gene expression through activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway. His laboratory showed for the first time that the Diacetyl enzyme Sirt1 present in the hypothalamus operates as a nutrient sensor involved in the regulation of food intake. He also revealed that endoplasmic reticulum stress, developed in the hypothalamus of the obese, prevents the proper protein folding and processing of POMC, which is an essential anorectic precursor to maintain body weight in check. Through his active 26 years at Brown, Dr. Nillni had trained more than 50 undergraduate students in their independent study class. He has mentored summer interns, numerous graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows. He was an executive member of the Molecular Biology, Cell Biology & Biochemistry Ph.D. graduate program and also a member of the Ph.D. and MD/Ph.D. admission committees. In addition to undergraduate courses, Dr. Nillni taught for 18 years a graduate class on protein processing and trafficking, a subject on cell biology that did not exist at the Molecular and Cellular Biology graduate program. Dr. Nillni has published more than 75 manuscripts including reviews, a book on energy balance, and obesity, and chapter books. He was on the editorial board of various prestigious scientific journals and has been a reviewer for nineteen journals including Nature, Cell, Journal of Biological Chemistry, and Journal of Clinical Investigation. He was also a member of several national and international review committees including the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health Study Sections for more than 24 years. Dr. Nillni is a member of the European Science Foundation and College of Experts.

Full Text PubMed Research Research Overview Obesity and its medical complications including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, and cancer account for more than 300,000 deaths per year in the United States. Obesity occurs as a result of a longstanding imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of obesity is essential for the development of effective therapies. My laboratory study the biology of different hypothalamic neuropeptide hormones affected by endoplasmic reticulum stress during diet-induced obesity, and nutrient sensors involved in the regulation of energy balance. Research Statement Nutrition is a fundamental mechanism for survival and eating is one of the greatest human pleasures, but it can also be disturbed leading to under-nutrition, over-nutrition, and eating disorders. In modern human society excess eating for unconscious susceptible individuals is leading to a growing obesity epidemic in the United States and other developed countries. Obesity or overweight state is the most costly nutritional disorder of the 21st century affecting 2.1 or more billion individuals worldwide. There are more obese and overweight people on the planet than people suffering from malnutrition. Recent data suggest that the prevalence of obesity in the United States is 35% for men and 40% for women. According to the Center for Disease Control, by 2030, medical costs associated with treating preventable obesity-related diseases are estimated to increase from $48 billion to $66 billion per year in the United States, and the loss in economic productivity could be between $390 billion and $580 billion annually by 2030. There have been many interventions developed to treat obesity, including dietary changes, increased activity and exercise, behavior modification, prescription weight-loss medication, and weight-loss surgery; however, most have failed. Specifically, most diets offered by different outlets have 75-95% failure after 1 or 2 years of intervention. Therefore, despite all of these tremendous efforts, obesity not only remains an unsolved problem, but obesity continues to rise. The survival of all species depends on their ability to acquire energy for its daily use and storage. From an evolutionary standpoint, feeding or intake of calories from meal to meal is necessary to: a) satisfy nutritional and metabolic requirements, and b) prepare for periods of food shortage during seasonal changes. Energy balance is the relationship that exists between energy intake (i.e., calories taken from food and drink) and energy expenditure (i.e., calories used for our daily energy requirements). Hence, the maintenance of this balance is achieved by the integration of a) environmental signals (i.e., environmental cues steer individuals decisions concerning food intake and food choice); b) physiological and metabolic signals (i.e., hormones, nutrient sensors, and critical organs); c) genetic makeup (i.e., multiple genetic interactions); and d) social and hedonic influences (i.e., the drive to eat to obtain pleasure without an energy deficit). When this balance is disrupted, we witness either a weight gain or a weight loss. In the case of weight gain, energy imbalance is caused by a higher calorie intake versus the number of calories burned. Therefore, we can define obesity as a Disorder of Energy Balance. This longstanding imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure is influenced by a very complex set of biological pathway systems regulating appetite. In summary, obesity results from multiple genetic and environmental factors that likely interact with each other. Specifically, genes operate additively and through gene-gene interactions to influence body weight. A longstanding obesity state will eventually cause type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, mood disorders, heart disease, liver disease, hypertension, reproductive disorders and cancer risk. The aim of this textbook, Energy Balance, Neuropeptide Hormones, and Neuroendocrine Function, is to provide a comprehensive description and discussion of the latest knowledge in peptide hormones and their action on energy balance, as well as a cutting-edge analysis by leading experts in the field. Peptide hormones play a central role in many physiological and metabolic processes acting in concert with other molecules to regulate an array of molecular mechanisms. Research from the last 30 years has shown the importance of peptide hormones in fields such as neuroscience, immunology, pharmacology, cell biology, and energy metabolism.
