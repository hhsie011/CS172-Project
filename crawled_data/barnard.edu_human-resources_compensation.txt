To that end, the College seeks to recruit and support top-tier staff who will continue to secure Barnard’s reputation as a premier institution, support the College’s commitment to the liberal arts and women’s education, and its affiliation with Columbia University. To meet these needs and priorities, Barnard offers staff competitive total rewards within a culture that promotes diversity, using its unique location in the cosmopolitan urban environment of New York City as a platform. Barnard College’s compensation program is intended to provide pay that is commensurate with compensation at similar institutions; and administered fairly and in a financially sustainable manner, in order to attract, retain and engage qualified individuals. The compensation program is structured to recognize expertise, performance and fulfillment of role expectations, and support career growth and professional development. The compensation program strives for external competitiveness in accordance with Barnard’s needs and financial resources, and with due consideration of internal equity among divisions and employees performing similar functions based on the requisite knowledge and expertise required to fulfill those positions. Barnard seeks to pay aggregate salaries at competitive levels of its comparison markets, as required to assure an outstanding staff. Comparison Markets Barnard compares salaries to the relevant geographic market, accounting for the New York City market as appropriate, and industry (e.g., higher education, not-for-profit, and for-profit organizations), depending upon the functional nature of the job and level of responsibilities. Barnard also takes into consideration the higher education market on a national level, in particular, peer institutions that are comparable in mission, size, and scope. Pay System Base salary is the primary method of rewarding staff at Barnard College, An individual's base salary reflects: The value of the job in the market The value of the job to the institution Individual capabilities (including skill sets, experience, and performance against job expectations) Other benefits such as health care, disability insurance, life insurance, tuition assistance, paid time off, and retirement benefits are important components of Barnard’s total rewards program. Appropriate base salaries are maintained by regularly reviewing and updating job descriptions and through the periodic evaluation of the salary program. Salary program reviews (i.e., updating and maintenance) are used to ensure that the jobs, market comparisons, and structures are current and remain consistent with the aims of the College. Beyond Market Factors Barnard College’s goal is to ensure the success of all staff through compensation and related programs by providing an environment where people can grow and excel. The College strives to promote performance excellence. Career and personal development is encouraged by rewarding employee accomplishments, skills, knowledge, achievements and outcomes. Pay Communication Barnard College is committed to openness, transparency, and timely communication pertaining to the compensation philosophy, classification system, and pay practices to ensure that the principles that guide salary decisions are clearly understood. Barnard will disseminate compensation guidelines and protocols on a regular basis using varied forms of print, electronic and verbal communication. Pay Governance The Office of Human Resources administers and maintains the salary program in collaboration with the Finance Office which includes program development and ongoing review and maintenance. Departments and offices, through their respective office heads and managers propose and consult with HR generalists regarding salary actions based on compensation guidelines provided by Barnard’s Office of Human Resources. Salary actions are determined and authorized by the Finance Office in partnership with the Office of Human Resources who communicates final salary decisions. Classification Barnard College seeks to have a classification architecture that is transparent and provides clear guidance criteria for distinguishing jobs at different levels based on required skills, experience, behaviors, and competencies. Although not a perfect science, this framework will serve as a guide and help to align job expectations with the institution’s salary structure and employee performance/behavioral expectations. The Classification Grid The Admin job classification applies to those positions that have been determined to be exempt from overtime requirements and perform duties consistent with the Fair Labor Standards rules for exemption. At Barnard, Admin positions range from ADM grade 4 to 12 and Executive classification. A standard workweek for an exempt position is 35 hrs per week, however, exempt employees may work unlimited hours during a workweek without an expectation of overtime or compensatory time. The following table illustrates the position grade, (left) with specific competencies expected for that grade (top). Definitions and descriptions are as follows: Strategic Influence: The sphere of influence and the range and impact of actions (e.g., the benefit or harm to the institution, the gain or loss of resources, the goodwill created, etc.) Authority and Accountability: Responsibility or autonomy exercised in terms of guidance required, guidance given to fellow employees, and independence of action. Scope of duties and activities with consideration given to the degree of strategic and operational influence in College, department/functional area, and job Problem Solving and Decision Making: The types of problems encountered and decisions made, including the finality of these decisions and actions taken Knowledge, Skills, and Experience: Education, aptitude and qualifications needed by the employee in order to perform the assigned duties, including technical skills and knowledge specific to Barnard Administrative Staff Classification Grid Site Footer Footer About the College Back Offices & Services Back Communications Back Contacts Email Signatures Copyright and Image Use Design and Production Digital Signs Faculty Working with the Media Media Relations Social Media Guidelines Templates Writing/Messaging Purchasing Back Citizens Bank MasterCard Purchasing Procedures & Forms Ombuds Office Back About the Ombuds Finance & Operations Mail Services Back Addressing Incoming Mail Breaks, Leaves & Graduation Incoming Mail Local Mail Outgoing Mail Outgoing Mail Privacy Policy Prohibited Items Receiving Your Mail and Packages Printing at Barnard Human Resources Back About HR Benefits Compensation Employment Opportunities at Barnard Employment Diversity and Inclusion Policies News and Announcements Accounts Payable Bursar Back Tuition & Fees Policies Understanding your Bill Payment Options Tuition Refunds Perkins Loan Information 1098-T Tax Credits Tuition-related forms Facilities Back Service Information Job Opportunities Visit Back Directions Campus Map Local Resources Back Parking Restaurants Accommodations Diversity & Inclusion Nondiscrimination & Title IX Privacy Policy Copyright © 2022 Barnard College | Columbia University | 3009 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 | 212.854.5262
