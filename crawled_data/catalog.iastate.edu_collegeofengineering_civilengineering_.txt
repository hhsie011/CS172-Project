The Civil Engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org. Civil engineers apply principles of motion and materials to plan, design, construct, maintain, and operate public and private facilities, while working under economic, social, and environmental constraints. Commonly included are transportation systems; bridges and buildings; water supply, pollution control, waste management, irrigation, and drainage systems; river and harbor improvements; dams and reservoirs. Civil engineering also includes planning, designing, and executing surveying operations and locating, delimiting, and delineating physical and cultural features on the earth's surface. Research, testing, sales, management, and related functions are also a part of civil engineering. Work on campus is supplemented by inspection trips, which furnish an opportunity for firsthand study of engineering systems in operation, as well as projects under construction. Environmental engineering, as an emphasis in civil engineering, is concerned with protecting the public and natural health; providing an ample safe water supply; managing solid and hazardous waste; treating and disposing of domestic and industrial wastewaters and waste; resource recovery; providing adequate drainage of urban and rural areas for sanitation; and controlling water quality, soil contamination, and air pollution. The environmental emphasis for the civil engineering degree replaces some of the courses and electives in the general curriculum with further courses in chemistry, biology, and microbiology as well as specific topics in environmental engineering and design. Student Learning Outcomes Graduates of the civil engineering curriculum should have, at the time of graduation: an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies. Program Educational Objectives By three to five years after graduation, graduates of the civil engineering program will have: Pursued successful careers and expertise in civil engineering or a related profession. Collaborated effectively on multi-disciplinary teams to address the needs of society and the environment. Pursued lifelong learning, professional development, and licensure as appropriate for their career goals. The civil engineering curriculum equips students with a broad education that includes technical skills in analysis and design and professional practices such as communication, teamwork, leadership, and ethics. The faculty encourages the students to develop their professional skills by participating in cooperative education, internships, or progressive summer engineering employment and study abroad programs. Qualified juniors and seniors interested in graduate studies may apply to the Graduate College to concurrently pursue the bachelor degree and either a master of science in Civil Engineering or a master of business administration in the College of Business Administration. These students would have the opportunity to graduate in five years with both degrees.

Go to: https://www.ccee.iastate.edu/prospective-graduate-students/concurrent-programs/ for more information. Graduate Study The Department of Civil, Construction and Environmental Engineering offers graduate programs for the degrees of master of engineering, master of science, and doctor of philosophy with a major in civil engineering with areas of specialization in structural engineering, environmental engineering, construction engineering and management, geotechnical engineering, civil engineering materials, transportation engineering, and intelligent infrastructure engineering. The department also offers graduate minors of 9 to 15 credits of coursework to students from other engineering departments. Candidates for the degrees of master of engineering and master of science are required to complete a total of 30 acceptable graduate credits. The master of engineering degree involves all course work. The master of science degree requires the preparation of a thesis or creative component. Candidates for the doctor of philosophy degree are required to complete a minimum of 72 acceptable graduate credits. Normal prerequisite for major graduate work in civil engineering is the completion of an undergraduate curriculum substantially equivalent to that required of engineering students at this university. Due to the diversity of interests within the graduate programs in civil engineering, a student may qualify for graduate study even though undergraduate or prior graduate training has been in a discipline other than engineering. Supporting work will be required depending upon the student’s background and area of interest. The department participates in the interdepartmental graduate programs in transportation, environmental science, and wind energy science, engineering and policy. The department also offers graduate certificates in construction management, environmental engineering, and environmental systems. The construction management certificate requires 12 graduate credits (nine credits of “core courses” and three credits of approved “elective courses”). The environmental engineering or environmental systems certificate requires 12 graduate credits (six credits of "core courses", six credits of approved "elective courses") and a seminar course or an approved equivalent.
