Students study majors from across cutting-edge interdisciplinary fields, the humanities, foreign languages and cultures, and the social sciences. Current UT Austin students must meet with an academic advisor in the desired department to declare that major. Some majors are restricted or competitive and students must first attend an information session or apply before being considered for admission. Visit the major advising page, linked below, for specific details on each major and the process for declaring your major of interest. Student Affairs advisors in the Dean’s Office are available to meet with students to explore, and potentially narrow, broad interests in the Liberal Arts. Whether you are looking to transfer into Liberal Arts or add an additional Liberal Arts major, our academic advisors look forward to sharing the many opportunities in and out of the classroom our majors offer and how they fit into your educational and post-graduation goals.
