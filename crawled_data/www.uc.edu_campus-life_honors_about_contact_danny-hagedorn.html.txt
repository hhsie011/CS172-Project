Student Affairs & Higher Education, Indiana State University B.A. History, Northern Kentucky University A little about me... Originally from Covington, KY, I grew up in the shadow of Cincinnati my whole life but rarely ventured across the river until college. I am a first-generation college graduate and received my Bachelor’s degree in History with a focus on Military History at Northern Kentucky University, and accepting the offer to join the Honors Program there changed everything. I met my wife and mother of my two kids in the Honors Residence Hall my junior year, I made friends that I still talk to every day (thank you Discord) and discovered my passion for working in higher education there. The opportunities provided to me in that program (undergraduate research, honors seminars, leadership inside and outside the classroom) helped me to discover and understand the world beyond my little KY town and taught me to think critically and go beyond the surface level of comprehension to make sure I truly understand what’s happening in the world. These overwhelmingly positive experiences led me to apply for a position with the Honors Program at UC, and I couldn’t be more excited to work with the students here and guide them on unique opportunities to foster their personal and academic growth as they plan and work towards their future dreams.
