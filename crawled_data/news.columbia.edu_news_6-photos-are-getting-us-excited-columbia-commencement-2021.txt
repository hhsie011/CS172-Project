Genevieve Wang, BC’21 Writes Wang: “Thanks to New York theaters for bringing light and color to my four years at Morningside Heights! And my friends who went with me! I love you all.” 3. Emily Carrero, GS’21 4. Hafsa Khawaja, GSAS'21 “Coming to an entirely new continent to study, oceans away from family and familiarity, is never quite easy, writes Khawaja. "But ending up in the same program as three brilliant, kind, intelligent, and wonderful women — Aaisha Salman (GSAS '20), Sarah Malik (GSAS '20), and Ramsha Siddiqui (GSAS '21) — gave me a community of comfort, friendship, joy, and love that I will hold onto for an entire lifetime and that I will always remember my graduate school experience by. I am tremendously grateful to have encountered these three incredible individuals at Columbia and in the city of New York. These people and these places were and will always be my home away from home.” 5. Zeng Yao, SEAS’21 “Comparison pics of 2019 and 2021," writes Yao. 6. Travis Lubin, SIPA’21 And don’t forget to download the Columbia Commencement 2021 grad-cap filter on Instagram! Are you a part of the Class of 2021?
