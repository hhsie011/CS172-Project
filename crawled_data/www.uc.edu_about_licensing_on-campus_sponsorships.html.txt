Are you are an outside company or organization interested in being affiliated with the University? The University defines these associations as a sponsorship. Before any sponsorship activities take place between an outside company or organization and the University, approval must be granted. Below are the steps of the request process. Sponsorship Request Form Sponsorship Request Process Begin the process early to allow sufficient time for review. We recommend at least 60 days prior to the activation of the sponsorship. Design artwork for the sponsorship, if necessary. See the Do's & Don'ts for artwork guidelines. Select a sponsorship approved vendor to produce any products associated with the sponsorship. These vendors are listed below. Complete the Sponsorship Request Form (linked above) describing the sponsorship activity, sponsor/outside organization involved, and which University mark(s) are being requested to use. Please provide as much information on this form as possible. Note: If artwork is associated with the sponsorship, please upload the artwork in the form. The Sponsorship Review Committee will review your request. It typically takes 2-4 weeks to process each request. After the review has been completed, we will e-mail the requestor and sponsor confirming if the request has been approved as shown, if any changes are required, or if the request has been denied along with an explanation. Note: Approval to use the University's brand in partner with a sponsorship/outside company does not allow approval to use the brand again without seeking additional approval. You must submit a new form for each new request. Sponsorship-Approved Vendors Associated Premium Lori Heiney 1870 Summit Rd.
