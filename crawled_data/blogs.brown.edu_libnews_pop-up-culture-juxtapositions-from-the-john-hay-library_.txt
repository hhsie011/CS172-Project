Starting with a selection of poetic works activated and projected through three-dimensional representation—or pop-up books—the exhibition proposes a range of comparisons including the literal (octopus to octopus), the genealogical (Brooklyn ferry to Brooklyn Bridge), and the meditative (mapping and being). Each work represents a point of discovery within the expansive network of resources that support the intellectual and creative work of the University. Location: Finn Room Cases (Rockefeller Library) Date: October 2014–January 9, 2015 contact: Christopher Geissler This entry was posted in Exhibits & Events by [email protected].
