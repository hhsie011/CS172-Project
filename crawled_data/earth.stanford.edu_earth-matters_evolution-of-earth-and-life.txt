About Stanford Earth Matters About the new school Climate ChangeEvolution of Earth and Life How a soil microbe could rev up artificial photosynthesis Researchers discover that a spot of molecular glue and a timely twist help a bacterial enzyme convert carbon dioxide into carbon compounds 20 times faster than plant enzymes do during photosynthesis. The results stand to accelerate progress toward converting carbon dioxide into a variety of products.

The findings may help scientists grasp how these important ecosystems will respond to a changing climate. ClockDec 14 Mail LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Navigate to item Dynamic EarthEvolution of Earth and Life Sierra Nevada range should celebrate two birthdays New research reveals that after its initial formation 100 million years ago, the Sierra Nevada “died” during volcanic eruptions that blasted lava across much of the American West 40 million to 20 million years ago. Then, tens of millions of years later, the Sierra Nevada mountain range as we know it today was “reborn.” ClockNov 15 Mail LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Navigate to item Evolution of Earth and LifeOceans Researchers find whales eat more than expected Research on whale feeding highlights how the precipitous decline of large marine mammals has negatively impacted the health and productivity of ocean ecosystems. ClockNov 3 Mail LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Navigate to item Evolution of Earth and LifeOceans Extinction changes rules of body size evolution A sweeping analysis of marine fossils from most of the past half-billion years shows the usual rules of body size evolution change during mass extinctions and their recoveries. The discovery is an early step toward predicting how evolution will play out on the other side of the current extinction crisis. ClockOct 6 Mail LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Navigate to item Climate ChangeEvolution of Earth and LifeOceans Why extinctions ran amok in ancient oceans, and why they slowed down A new Stanford University study shows rising oxygen levels may explain why global extinction rates slowed down over the past 541 million years. Below 40 percent of present atmospheric oxygen, ocean dead zones rapidly expand, and extinctions ramp up. ClockOct 5 Mail LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Navigate to item Evolution of Earth and Life Plants evolved complexity in two bursts – with a 250-million-year hiatus A new method for quantifying plant evolution reveals that after the onset of early seed plants, complexity halted for 250 million years until the diversification of flowering plants about 100 million years ago.

ClockJul 8 Mail LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Navigate to item Evolution of Earth and Life Stanford ecologists develop a theory about how plants ‘pay’ their microbes Combining economics, psychology and studies of fertilizer application, researchers find that plants nearly follow an “equal pay for equal work” rule when giving resources to partner microbes – except when those microbes underperform. ClockJul 7 Mail LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Navigate to item Climate ChangeEvolution of Earth and LifeOceans Biodiversity loss in warming oceans A fossil study from Stanford University finds the diversity of life in the world’s oceans declined time and again over the past 145 million years during periods of extreme warming. Temperatures that make it hard for cold-blooded sea creatures to breathe have likely been among the biggest drivers for shifts in the distribution of marine biodiversity.

The result is a complex and dynamic epidemic trajectory.
