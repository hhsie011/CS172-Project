No paper applications will be accepted. Scholarships are available for both undergraduate and graduate students. To get started, visit ECUAWard at http://ecu.academicworks.com. Sign in with your Pirate ID and password. You first must complete a general application. You can find instructions here: http://www.ecu.edu/cs-acad/universityscholarships/ECUAWard-Instructional-Materials.cfm. The general application will ask you questions about your involvement in campus and community service activities, your future educational plans, career goals, etc. Your permanent mailing address, major, GPA, hours completed, etc. will be imported from Banner, so you will not be required to enter that information. Once you have completed the general scholarship application, including your electronic signature, you may be prompted to “Start Applying” and shown a list of recommended opportunities that require further review to determine your eligibility. Please take your time and look through this list and, if interested, “apply”. All applicants who submit a completed application will be notified of their application status via their ECU email account in the spring semester.
