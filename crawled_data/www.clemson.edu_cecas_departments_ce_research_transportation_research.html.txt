As transportation systems are interrelated with other activities, our group conducts research to meet the challenges of developing and managing the mobility of people and goods with an interdisciplinary approach. Transportation systems group has diverse expertise that facilitates conducting research that can only be addressed through cross-disciplinary collaboration. Several high profile state and national projects have been in the track records of the transportation systems group. The group has been involved in an array of transportation related research including instrumented vehicle studies of driving behavior, new sensing equipment for traffic surveillance, crash analysis using event data recorders, applications of advanced technologies in the transportation system, evaluation of methods for controlling speed in work zones, applications of geographic information systems in program management, the design of incident management systems, development of regional and statewide ITS architecture, multi-objective analysis and real-time traffic simulation, wide-area traffic sensor system deployment and evaluation study of traffic operations in short-term work zones, and the development of decision support tools for infrastructure design and operations.
