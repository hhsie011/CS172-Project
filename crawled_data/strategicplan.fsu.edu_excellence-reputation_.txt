We’ve already proved we have what it takes to become one of Florida’s Preeminent Universities. With support from our stakeholders that is commensurate with our bold, ambitious vision, FSU’s momentum will be truly unstoppable: we will be known as a university that makes a difference in the lives of our students and in the quality of life of our society.
