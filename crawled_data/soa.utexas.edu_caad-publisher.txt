In 2005, the CAAD added the editing and publishing of an additional book series, Centerline, and in 2008 took on the co-production of the O’Neil Ford series of Monographs and Duographs on a regular basis. Among the designer-writers published have been Christopher Alexander, Stan Allen, Aaron Betsky, Petra Blaisse, Christine Boyer, Denise Scott Brown, William Bruder, Henry Cisneros, Elizabeth Diller, Peter Eisenman, Tom Ford, Kenneth Frampton, Gary Hack, Rem Koolhaas, Rosalind Krauss, Sanford Kwinter, Phyllis Lambert, David Leatherbarrow, Lewis Tsurumaki Lewis, Rodolfo Machado, Barton Myers, Gerald McCue, Charles Moore, Mohsen Mostafavi, Todd Oldham, Juhani Pallasmaa, Smiljan Radic, Charles Renfro, Michael Rotondi, Joseph Rykwert, Jenny Sabin, Ricardo Scofidio, Mary Patricia May Sekler, Eduard Sekler, Robert A.M. Stern, Kim Tanzer, Billie Tsien, Anthony Vidler, Tod Williams, as well scores of prominent authors from other disciplines.

Each is a compilation of presented and invited papers from top scholars and practitioners worldwide, especially edited for the volume. With a focus on interdisciplinary study, CENTER series explores architecture in relation to its complementary arts and disciplines. Centerline—Where CENTER covers a broader scope of vision, Centerline is more focused, with each volume unpacking a single project, practice, or line of thought. Centerlines are typically authored by single practitioner-writers with introductions and supplementary essays by others. O’Neil Ford Monograph and Duograph—These two book series are offered in tandem, but have different foci. The Monograph series richly documents buildings of major importance in architectural theory and practice that have been under- or unrecognized by the canon of architectural writing. The Duograph series documents two different buildings by two different architects who are emerging as leaders in the field of architecture today. The purview is global. Other Publications—CAAD also publishes one-off volumes that fall outside of its three series.
