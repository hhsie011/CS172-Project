Copyright Information Toggle Copyright Yale University 2020. All Rights Reserved. Although parts of the Site are freely accessible, Yale does not intend to cede its respective rights, or the rights of third parties, to materials appearing on the Site. By downloading material from the Site, you agree that there is no explicit or implicit transfer of ownership rights. Yale grants you permission for limited non-commercial, educational, and personal use of materials for which Yale owns the copyright. Because Yale does not hold the copyright to various materials on the Site, Yale cannot grant or deny permission to use those materials. Accordingly, you are solely responsible for determining the copyright status of any materials you may wish to use, to investigate the owner of the copyright, and to obtain permission for your intended use. In all cases, you must cite Yale as the source, and, if a particular material is copyrighted, you must cite all copyright information and comply with all other terms or restrictions that may be applicable to that material. You do not need to obtain permission to use materials in the public domain. Additionally, United States copyright law contains an exception for fair use of copyrighted materials, which includes the use of protected materials for certain purposes of teaching, scholarship, research, criticism, commentary, and news reporting. You are solely responsible for determining whether any exceptions under United States copyright law apply and for responding to any claims that may arise from your use. Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement Yale intends that all material posted on the Site respect the copyright and other proprietary rights of third parties. However, Yale cannot monitor the copyright ownership of all material posted on the Site. If you believe that any material posted on the Site infringes your copyright, then you may request the removal of those materials from the Site in accordance with the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3), and the procedures described below. A notice of infringing material that complies with the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) (“Notice”) must be sent to the agent Yale has designated with the Copyright Office: H. Morrow Long University Information Security Officer Information Technology Services 100 Church Street South PO Box 208065 New Haven, CT 06520 copyright-list@yale.edu To comply with the Copyright Act, your Notice must be in writing and must include the following: A physical or electronic signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works; Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit Yale to locate the material; Information reasonably sufficient to permit Yale to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted; A statement that you have a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and A statement that the information in the notification is accurate and made under penalty of perjury, and that you are the owner, or authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. When Yale receives a Notice that complies with the Copyright Act, it will remove the identified material immediately. Yale will promptly take reasonable steps to inform the user who posted the allegedly infringing material (the “alleged infringer”) of the Notice and subsequent removal. The alleged infringer may then provide Yale with a counter-notice (“Counter-Notice”) that the initial infringement notice was erroneous. Such Counter-Notice must be in writing and must include: A physical or electronic signature of the alleged infringer; Identification of the material removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled; A statement under penalty of perjury that the alleged infringer has a good-faith belief that the material was removed or access to it disabled as a result of error; The alleged infringer’s name, address, and telephone number; and A statement of consent to jurisdiction in federal district court and that the alleged infringer consents to service of process from the complaining party or its agent. Upon receipt of a Counter-Notice, Yale will notify you of the Counter-Notice and restore the material within 10 to 14 business days of receipt of the Counter-Notice, unless you inform Yale that you have filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the allegedly infringing party from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the Site.
