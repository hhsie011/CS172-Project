Their interests broadly include understanding and measuring material properties experimentally and the influence this has on large scale geophysical models. Presently, they're working with the rock and ice mechanics group at Lamont on a set of experiments studying firn compaction to answer how compaction depends on physical parameters (density, temperature, stress) and how this can be applied to glacial models.
