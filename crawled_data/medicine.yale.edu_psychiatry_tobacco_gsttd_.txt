Women, compared to men, have poorer rates of smoking cessation, exacerbated health risks, and FDA-approved medications for smoking cessation may not be as effective for women or have emerging limits due to side effects. The Yale-SCOR (2012-2018) was funded by the Office of Research on Women’s Health and the National Institute of Drug Abuse. Our center brought together leading basic and clinical science experts to establish an interdisciplinary and translational program of research aimed at identifying novel therapeutics to address the critical health disparity faced by female smokers.
