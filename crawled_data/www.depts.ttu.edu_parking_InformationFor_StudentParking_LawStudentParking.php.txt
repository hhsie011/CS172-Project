Texas Tech University Directory Raiderlink A-Z Index Transportation & Parking Services Menu Search TTU Transportation & Parking Services Law Student Parking Once accepted and enrolled as a student of Texas Tech University School of Law, you may set up your parking. As a 1L, you will purchase an ePermit for Commuter West and add your name to the L21 wait list. Commuter West includes the lots directly northwest of the School of Law. (Learn more about commuter ePermits here.) The School of Law's lot is called R21 and is reserved for its ePermit holders weekdays from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Law student ePermits for R21 are called L21. Most students move into R21 on a rolling basis the fall of their 2L year. Wait lists are worked two to three weeks into the fall semester to ensure an exact number of ePermits can be released and not lead to lot overcrowding. Once on campus, obtain a free L sticker from the School of Law's administration office, and place it above your vehicle's registration sticker on the inside of the windshield. The L sticker provides access to R21 during large evening events at the United Supermarkets Arena courtesy of TPS and the USA. No additional ePermit is required.
