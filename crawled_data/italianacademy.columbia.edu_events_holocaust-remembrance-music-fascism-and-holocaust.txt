Europe and the United Nations commemorate the victims of the Shoah each winter on the date of Auschwitz's liberation in 1945; the Italian Academy presents an annual academic event exploring issues of discrimination and crimes against humanity. In previous years, the Academy broadened its focus to explore groups that were targeted in the racism and xenophobia of the Nazi and Fascist regimes, and that suffered and died along with the millions of Jews: the Roma and Sinti (known as Gypsies); homosexuals; women; and the disabled. This year, our Symposium will address music, Fascism, and the Holocaust.
