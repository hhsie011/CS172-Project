Goals Self-Assessment Categories Bronze Award News Increasing Equity in STEMM North Carolina State University is a charter member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science's (AAAS) Sea Change initiative. Our Commitment to Equity I am thrilled about NC State’s participation in AAAS’ SEA Change initiative as a charter member. This is an opportunity to use empirical data and thoughtful self-assessment, reflection, and goal-setting to advance educational equity and foster innovation. I am confident that what we learn from investigating equity in STEM fields will offer new opportunities for innovation and growth at NC State. — Chancellor Randy Woodson How to Get Involved Contact the Office for Institutional Equity and Diversity with any questions or to get involved.
