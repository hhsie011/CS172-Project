In order to do that, follow the steps below: Log into Dartmouth Directory Manager. Click Emergency Contact Info in the right-hand navigation column. Enter the cell phone number where you want to receive emergency information. US numbers should be entered in the format: ###-###-####. International numbers should be entered in the format: Enter a plus sign (+) followed by the country code, any special codes required by the country, followed by the number, with no punctuation or spaces other than the plus sign. For example, for a number where the country code is 44 (England), the number is outside London (0), the exchange is 173, and 123555 is the individual number would be entered as +440173123555. Click to receive that information via text or voice. We recommend selecting Text as text messages are sent faster than voice mail messages, and text messages are delivered in areas where there is poor cell coverage. Click Submit Contact Info.
