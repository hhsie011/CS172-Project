Army ROTC: Combining Civilian Education and Military Leadership The Army Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) is a program designed to develop college students across the country into competent leaders. It allows cadets to remain full-time students at their colleges and universities while giving them the opportunity to work part-time on earning a commission in the Army. ROTC augments the United States Military Academy at West Point (USMA) by providing additional officers to the active duty Army, as well as being the primary source of officers to the Army Reserve and National Guard. Graduates of the ROTC program emerge as 2nd Lieutenants in the Active Army, Army Reserve, or Army National Guard and work very well under pressure, are great communicators, and know how to lead effectively. ROTC graduates are highly sought after for their leadership and technical skills. 1101 and 1102 Military Science Classes are open to all students for elective credit. We also have a free Physical Education class that counts toward Cornell’s PE requirement. Check the course catalog for more information.
