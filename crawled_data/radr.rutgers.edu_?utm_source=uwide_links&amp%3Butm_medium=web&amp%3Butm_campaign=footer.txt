Every ODS team member will work closely with each student individually in order to develop an effective and comprehensive plan for appropriate services and reasonable accommodations. We are dedicated to provide information and resources necessary to allow students to pursue their academic, personal, and professional goals while at Rutgers. It is our goal to aid in the development of our students in becoming responsible decision makers and self-advocates who are in charge of their own future through providing essential tools and supports. In addition, we are dedicated to working with administrators, faculty, staff and students throughout the university community to promote and provide awareness of creating an inclusive environment for all individuals that will continue to contribute to Rutgers as a leading national public research university and the state’s preeminent, comprehensive public institution of higher education. We envision a campus community where all individuals are welcomed, valued, and encouraged to be contributing members. -Bill Welsh Associate Vice President Rutgers Access and Disability Resources (RADR) Copyright © 2020, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, an equal access / equal opportunity, affirmative action institution.
