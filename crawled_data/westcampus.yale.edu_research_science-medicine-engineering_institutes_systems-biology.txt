One focal area of particular relevance to Yale researchers involves dynamic gene regulatory networks, which provide a springboard for the integration of mathematical theory and bioinformatics. The creation of a Systems Biology Institute at the YWC provides a generative focus for the research interests of faculty in the physical and biological sciences, and for topics ranging from molecules to whole organisms.
