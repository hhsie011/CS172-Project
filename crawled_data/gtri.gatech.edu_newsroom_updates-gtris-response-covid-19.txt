GTRI follows guidance from Georgia Tech, the University System of Georgia, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Georgia Department of Public Health (GDPH). This guidance includes making the Covid-19 vaccine available and following protocols when there are positive Covid-19 cases. Also available at GTRI are robust cleaning protocols and readily available PPE and sanitizing products. Where GTRI employees are embedded or working alongside our sponsors, you can expect GTRI employees to meet the sponsor’s workplace protocols. In the spring of 2020, GTRI developed a multi-stage, phased ramp-up plan. This ramp-up plan was written with a paramount commitment to employee safety. As of June 2021, the organization is focusing on maximizing our ability to deliver sponsored research. More GTRI employees are returning back to on-site work while the organization also realizes work-from-home opportunities as appropriate. GTRI Secure Space COVID-19 Guidance Sponsored research continues to occur inside U.S. Government accredited secure spaces at GTRI. Secure spaces follow the aforementioned precautions. If you have any safety or security concerns in those secure spaces, it will be important to address this with your management, Al Concord, 404-407-7998, al.concord@gtri.gatech.edu or Jon Riling, 404-0407-7010, jon.riling@gtri.gatech.edu.
