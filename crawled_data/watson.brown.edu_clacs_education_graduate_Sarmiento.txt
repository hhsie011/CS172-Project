Successful applicants receive up to $5,000 to support humanities and social science research in and on Spanish-speaking South America. The funds may be used between July 2019-June 2020 to cover travel and research expenses. The program is funded by the Sarmiento Flexible Fund for Latin American Studies, which was established through the generous support of Alfredo C. Cassiet, M.D. and Maria-Elena Cassiet, and can only accept candidates who are “natives or residents of Spanish-speaking countries south of Panama, not including the Caribbean.” Application and Eligibility Requirements Deadline: April 15, 2021 at 5:00pm Past Recipients 2017-2018 recipients included Luis Achondo (Music), Nicolás Campisi (Hispanic Studies), and Miguel Rosas (Hispanic Studies).
