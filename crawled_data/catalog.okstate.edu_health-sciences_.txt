The OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine is helping to address that challenge and to fulfill a critical need in Oklahoma, and beyond, by training physicians who are qualified to treat every member of the family and enhance the health care process by applying his or her knowledge to treat the whole person. The mission of the OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine is to educate osteopathic primary care physicians with an emphasis on serving rural and underserved Oklahoma. The majority of graduates of the OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine practice in the primary care fields—family medicine, pediatrics, internal medicine and obstetrics/gynecology. The remaining graduates do their postdoctoral training in other specialties and subspecialties—anesthesiology, neurology, psychiatry, radiology, surgery, dermatology and oncology, to name a few. Regardless of the field they pursue, our students are trained to be excellent physicians, beginning with a strong background in general osteopathic medicine. The college was founded in 1972 in response to a physician shortage in the small towns and rural areas of Oklahoma. The college opened its doors in 1974 and graduated its first class in 1977. In 1988, the college was merged with Oklahoma State University and confirmed its mission to prepare students to be primary care physicians with emphasis in rural medicine. In 2001, the Oklahoma legislature added another designation by creating the OSU Center for Health Sciences—the umbrella organization for the College of Osteopathic Medicine; and graduate programs in biomedical and forensic sciences, health care administration and athletic training. The OSU Center for Health Sciences is located on 16 acres along the west bank of the Arkansas River with an impressive view of downtown Tulsa. Modern buildings house conference facilities, a hospital simulation center, expanded classroom space, a medical bookstore and a forensic sciences and biomedical research facility. The OSU Medical Center, located a half-mile north of campus, is the primary teaching hospital for the college. The medical center serves Tulsa and the surrounding communities, and serves as both a teaching clinic for medical students, interns and residents, and a health care resource for residents of Tulsa and the surrounding area. The medical center is a state entity operated by the Oklahoma State University Medical Authority, with management by Saint Francis Health System. The hospital provides comprehensive and specialized health care and is staffed by licensed physicians and other health care professionals who supervise students in the care of patients. The OSU combined clinic system covers a wide variety of specialties. The clinics provide essential health care to the community. The new OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine at the Cherokee Nation is an additional teaching site located in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. The 84,000-square-foot facility includes an anatomy laboratory, clinical skills and OMM labs, standardized patient labs and a simulation center that features state-of-the-art computer programmable manikins. There are also lecture halls, classrooms, a gym, faculty offices and study carrels. Promoting a patient-centered approach to health care, osteopathic physicians are concerned with the entire patient. The doctor of osteopathic medicine is a fully-trained and licensed physician who selectively utilizes all accepted scientific modalities to maintain and restore health. Osteopathic physicians and surgeons are licensed in every state to practice all phases of medicine, and offer their patients the added dimension of health care through osteopathic manipulation, a hands-on technique that uses palpation and manipulative procedures of the musculoskeletal system to diagnose and treat illness.

College Curriculum The four-year program emphasizes the integration of biomedical sciences with clinical systems. The curriculum includes early hands-on clinical experiences with patients, patient models, and simulations. Instructional methods are student-centered and include traditional lecture, and small group and team-based learning. Problem-solving and information retrieval skills are emphasized to produce and develop skills that support lifelong learning. The culture of the OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine encourages students to establish an academic relationship with faculty members and community-based physicians. The curriculum emphasizes integration of biomedical with clinical and behavioral sciences to permit the full comprehension of the clinician’s work and promote a holistic approach to the care of patients and their families. Students receive training in all areas of medicine, with additional emphasis on osteopathic manipulative medicine. Incorporated within the OSU-COM curriculum is a Rural Medical Track, a Tribal Medicine Track and a Global Health Track. Each of these stresses the unique nature and characteristics of a rural practice, provides a pathway for student matriculation into a rural primary care residency, and supports residency graduates in the establishment of a practice in a rural or underserved Oklahoma location. The first semester focuses on the foundations of biomedical and clinical sciences along with an introduction to patient care. Starting in the second semester and continuing through the end of the second year, students are introduced to a total of 11 clinical systems that systematically prepare students for addressing conditions typically seen in the primary care environment. The third and fourth years are comprised of clinical rotations, which are community-based, consisting of clerkship experiences in hospitals and clinics where students observe patient care and participate in the evaluation and treatment of patients under physician faculty supervision. In the Clerkship Program, students are required to complete 22, four-week rotations in the core areas of family medicine, osteopathic manipulative medicine, pediatrics, internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics-gynecology, psychiatry and emergency medicine. In addition to the core rotations, students are also required to complete three rotations at affiliated teaching sites in rural communities, two of which are focused on gaining experience in a rural hospital setting. Students must also complete two primary care electives, seven general electives and one required vacation. Many rotations are completed at the OSU Medical Center in Tulsa, one of the largest osteopathic hospitals in the United States. Furthermore, students enrolled in the Rural Medical Track Program take our mission to serve rural Oklahoma to new heights. The Rural Medical Track Program is designed to allow students to complete, whenever possible, the core rotations in rural communities. In addition to the core rotations, the Rural Medical Track students must also complete at least two sub-internships with rural residency programs, as well as two sub-specialty electives. Students graduate from the four-year program with the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree. Although more than half of graduates enter primary care, graduates are prepared to enter residencies in all medical specialty fields. This training period lasts a minimum of three years with several specialties requiring up to five years of postgraduate education. To see a full list of residency programs our recent graduates have entered and residency acceptance data, along with OSU-COM’s pass rate on the COMLEX-USA, please visit: https://medicine.okstate.edu/com/admissions/graduates.html.
