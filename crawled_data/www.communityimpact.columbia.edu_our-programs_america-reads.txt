Your support allows us to bring high-quality services to the Morningside Heights and Washington Heights communities. Learn More Our Programs Community Impact is made up of over 27 different groups servicing the Harlem, Morningside Heights and Washington Heights areas. Our groups partner with service organizations, social service offices, religious institutions, senior centers and schools to serve over 8,000 people each year. Learn more About America Reads & Counts America Reads & Counts (AR&C) at Community Impact is one of 1,200 chapters at colleges and universities nationwide. We try to improve literacy at four public schools in the Morningside Heights and West Harlem neighborhoods. We provide daytime in-class assistance and after school tutoring for students in grades K-5. Tutors also seek to nurture the value and joy of learning through mentorship and, in the process, grow in their awareness of socioeconomic disparities throughout the Morningside Heights and West Harlem communities. AR&C tutors can work either as volunteers or as federal work-study employees, at a minimum of two hours per week. Tutors can also become coordinators, taking on administrative responsibilities.
