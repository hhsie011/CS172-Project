Statement of Solidarity from the English Department Faculty Courses Note that sections at the intermediate and advanced levels will frequently have themes. Please see Courses at Brown for current offerings. For English concentrators: 0900/0930 do not count toward the concentration. Only TWO courses at the 1000 level that deal primarily with writing can count toward the English concentration, although you’re certainly welcome to take more Nonfiction classes as extra courses. These two writing courses will count as electives for English concentrators. For English concentrators not on the Nonfiction track: 0900/0930 do not count toward the concentration. You must take at least three courses in Nonfiction at the 1000 level, at least two of which must be at the advanced (11XX or above) level. Therefore, only one course at the 10XX intermediate level can be counted towards the English nonfiction track concentration. English nonfiction track concentrators tend to take more than the three nonfiction courses required, however, and you are welcome to do so, too.

The Program attracts students from disciplines across the campus, who fulfill the one requirement that Brown’s charter mandates—that students take two writing courses in their educational sojourn here. In the Program, you might encounter a course that asks you to learn about and practice writing biography; or to explore the rich, multidisciplinary archives at the Hay Library; or to contemplate the intersection of the visual and textual arts; or to write as an activist for social change and equity; or to compose specifically for a digital audience; or to learn how best to interview and write to deadline for newspapers and magazines. Our track prepares students to speak for themselves, in writing, in their personal and professional lives. Most of our classes are conducted as small seminars, with some innovative online courses as well. Please see our current offerings and sign up for our Nonfiction News Group, which uses your Brown email to alert you to opportunities and other announcements.
