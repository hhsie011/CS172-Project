I study the role of microorganisms as agents of biogeochemical transformations, and how microbes adapt to different environments and respond to stress. I am interested in the effects of climate as well as nutrients and energy availability on the distribution, growth and productivity of microplankton but also in the potential of life to adapt to extreme environments and the implications for astrobiology. I use experimental approaches to answer some of the most pressing questions in microbial ecophysiology and biogeochemistry. In particular, I develop and use state-of-the-art techniques to study microbial processes at the taxonomic group and single cell levels.
