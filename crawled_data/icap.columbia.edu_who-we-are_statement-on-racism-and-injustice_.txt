We support local, national, and global public health agendas guided by social justice and that acknowledge the negative impacts of racism and inequality on the health of people and their communities. We unequivocally condemn racism in all forms. We commit to maintaining a work environment free from discrimination and discriminatory harassment, and to fostering a nurturing, vibrant community founded upon the fundamental dignity and worth of all. We pledge to be an antiracist organization. We will continuously seek to identify and address the ways in which we may fall short of our organizational expectations. As a first step, ICAP Headquarters has organized an internal Task Force on Racism and Injustice, dedicated to promoting open dialogue around topics of racism and inequality, and developing an internal organizational plan to address structural inequities and implicit bias in the workplace, and ICAP’s core public health work. We commit to maintaining open and respectful dialogue around topics of racism and inequality; to promoting an inclusive and respectful work environment; and to prioritizing the recruitment and retention of a diverse workforce.
