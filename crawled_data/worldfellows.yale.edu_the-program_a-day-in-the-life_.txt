It’s also anything but typical. Days are action-packed, including sessions with other members of the cohort, student liaisons, faculty and beyond. The program is meant to afford Fellows a chance to evolve their world views and to refine their goals, but moments for reflection are typically sandwiched in between busy days and a whirlwind time in New Haven. Just ask our Past Fellows, or glimpse a sample schedule below (though every day is different). NOV '19 2019 World Fellow Olena Sotnyk shared some photos from her day.
