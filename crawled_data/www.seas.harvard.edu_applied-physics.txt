Applied physicists explore the phenomena that become the foundation of quantum and photonic devices and novel materials. They also study the fundamentals of complex systems, including living organisms. Applied physicists are problem solvers by nature, and our PhDs find employment not only in academia but also in non-profits and industry, including startups. Applied Physics research at Harvard is facilitated by a number of world-class facilities and centers, including the Center for Integrated Quantum Materials; the Center for Nanoscale Systems, one of the world's most advanced research facilities housing a shared cleanroom, facilities for materials synthesis, and a microscopy suite; the Materials Research Science and Engineering Center; the Kavli Institute for Bionanoscience and Technology; the Quantitative Biology Initiative; the Center for Integrated Mesoscale Architectures for Sustainable Catalysis; and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering Applied Physics Leadership Vinothan N.
