He did his undergraduate and MS work in Physics at Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia, PhD at the University of Iowa and postdoctoral research fellowship at the University of Utah Department of Chemistry. His area of specialization includes Experimental and Theoretical Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics /and Chemical Physics. He built research capacity in chemical physics and atmospheric sciences at NCA&T with a combined federal grant of over 19 million. He served as the Department Chair. In 2010 he was the recipient of the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, mathematics and Engineering. He has received the senior researcher award for NCAT in 2002 and 2017, teaching excellence award in 2006, 2015 and 2018. Research Interests Research in Bililign group involves the use of Spectroscopic Techniques and theoretical methods for atmospheric applications: The focus is measuring in the lab and the field the optical and physio-chemical properties of Biomass Burning (BB) aerosols and understanding the role of BB Aerosols on climate, regional weather, air quality and health. We investigate i) How relative humidity (RH) photochemical aging morphology and burn conditions influence the size distribution, optical properties and chemical properties of BB aerosols produced from sub Saharan Africa Biomass Fuels. 2) Toxicity of Complex Aerosols from Biomass Burning.
