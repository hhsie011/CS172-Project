Fields are composed of faculty members from a number of departments who come together around a shared intellectual interest and may draw from different campuses or colleges. Graduate students are admitted to fields of study. Within each field, they select major and minor subjects, which are research interests or concentrations. Majors and Minors At Cornell, students are accepted into fields of study. Within each field are major subjects and areas of concentration. A major, like its undergraduate cousin, is a focused subject area where a student will conduct his or her research or scholarship. Concentrations are a subset within the major subject. Minor subjects are secondary areas of research. Some fields offer minor subjects only. Determining Your Major and Minor Subject Requirements Master’s degree students choose one major and one minor subject. Doctoral candidates choose one major and two minor subjects of study, although some fields have permission from the General Committee to require only one major and one minor subject. Faculty members are picked from these approved subjects to form a “special committee.” Special Committees If you are in a research-based degree program, you will select a special committee chair and additional faculty members to create a special committee. The special committee is responsible for helping you develop your research and academic program. The Graduate School imposes no requirements for courses or grades; your special committee will ensure you make appropriate progress and achievement. The timeline and process for composing special committees may vary by field. Your DGS and GFA can clarify the process for your field of study. To choose or change an advisor, you may submit a request online from the “Advisor” section of your Student Center. Land Acknowledgement Cornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' (the Cayuga Nation). The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
