Butler 75 Butler Library's 75th Anniversary, 1934-2009 Home Art & Architecture Construction People Your Stories In celebration of the 75th anniversary of the building of Butler Library, an exhibit of more than 100 photographs decorate the bulletin board display on the third floor of Butler Library. The photographs span the decades and showcase the excavation and rise of South Hall (as it was originally named), design details throughout the building, reading rooms, services such as research assistance and student activities -- which include sleeping as well as studying! Special Feature: Your Stories As part of our 75th anniversary celebration, we are gathering and sharing stories from alumni and students like you about discovery, personal reward, and fun. If you have a story or just a thought to share, we would love to read it.
