The goal is to give students hands-on experiences with real-world engineering projects, as well as provide support for faculty and students involved in design and fabrication for research. Connected by a soaring central atrium and glass-walled elevated walkways, the Class of 1982 Engineering and Computer Science Center (ECSC), the MacLean Engineering Sciences Center (ESC), and Cummings Hall place state-of-the-art student project labs at the heart of the combined buildings.
