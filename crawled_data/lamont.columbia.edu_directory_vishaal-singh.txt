I aim to identify the limits of our diagnostic capabilities - to improve our understanding of the surface physics and chemistry of ocean worlds, asteroids & comets. In other words, I break (and build) things in the lab to establish how they work beyond Earth. Fields of Interest Cryogenic Spectroscopy of ice-mineral analogs of Europa, Enceladus, and other Icy Worlds: estimate optical, spectral & mechanical properties of icy surfaces to constrain crystallinity, composition, and age; identify sites of “fresh” oceanic material for target site selection Design, build and test a robust communication tether prototype for ocean world exploration: laboratory mechanical & optical transmission characterization to improve TRL to 5; analyses using cryogenic fault shearing, composition, and freeze-in tests Ice Fracture origination and propogation in icy ocean worlds: estimate mechanics for formation of lineament vs cycloids on Europa using laboratory cryogenic tests Education Ph.D. in Geological Sciences, Arizona State University, 05/2021 (Dissertation: On Thin Ice: Experimental Spectroscopy and Ice Mechanics in Support of Ocean World Exploration) B.Sc.
