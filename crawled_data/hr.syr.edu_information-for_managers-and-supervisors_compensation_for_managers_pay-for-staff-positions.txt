Since there is a wide range of positions that can fit into a job category, the Office of Human Resources reviews all positions to recommend a competitive compensation range. Internal peer comparators and external market data are analyzed for nearly every staff position and a recommended salary range is determined and shared with the hiring school, college or unit. This protocol ensures parity across campus and allows the university to be more competitive. The Wage and Salary, Pay Rates Policy is a comprehensive resource for information on staff pay practice and includes information regarding: Annual increases Discretionary increases Pay rate reductions Currently, the minimum wage (for non-exempt employees) and minimum weekly compensation (for exempt employees) in New York State surpass federal requirements. Non-Exempt: Benefits-eligible staff must be paid a minimum of $15.00 per hour. Effective June 30, 2022, the minimum hourly rate for benefits-eligible employees will increase to $16.00. Temporary employees must be paid the New York State minimum wage for Central New York of $13.20 per hour. Effective June 30, 2022, the minimum hourly rate for temporary employees will increase to $15.00 per hour. Exempt: The minimum salary that may be paid to an exempt staff position per New York State law is $990.00 per week, regardless of the number of hours worked. This equates to $2,145.00 semi-monthly and $51,480 annually. Starting 2021, the annual increases will be published by the Commissioner of Labor on or before October 1. They will be based on percentage increases determined by the Director of the Division of Budget, based on economic indices, including the Consumer Price Index. Again, while these are the minimum rates, positions are reviewed so the minimum for a position can certainly be above these legal requirements. Pay bands provide a broad range to encompass all positions within a job classification. Most positions do not span the whole range; therefore, supervisors should work with the HR Compensation Team to identify the appropriate compensation range. Note: For staff employed in New York City and surrounding counties, and staff employed in California, the schedule may be different, so please contact the HR Compensation Team with any questions.
