A minor in Cognitive Neuroscience will strengthen the academic record of students who plan to apply for graduate programs. For example, in Psychology this minor will strengthen applicants' records for specializations such as Behavioral Neuroscience, Clinical Neuropsychology, Cognitive Psychology, or Psychophysiology. Students might also go into General Neuroscience or Cognitive Science. Pre-med students with a Cognitive Neuroscience minor would present distinctive profiles to medical school admissions offices. Students in the College of Liberal Arts (including Psychology majors) as well as students in other colleges, schools, and departments may choose to minor in Cognitive Neuroscience. Only the following courses can be double-counted for the Psychology major and the Cognitive Neuroscience minor: PSY 1001 Introduction to Psychology PSY 1003 Statistics for Psychology PSY 1004 Critical Thinking in Psychology Minors are awarded only at the time of completion of the bachelor's degree and cannot be awarded either as a stand-alone program of study or after completion of the first bachelor's degree.
