Throughout the last two years, I have been taking courses to earn my certificate in developmental disabilities. The last part of this certificate is to engage in a practicum or internship working with children with developmental disabilities. How far in advance did you prepare and begin applying for your experiential learning opportunity? I prepared the semester before, ensuring I knew the correct information to educate myself for this experience. I had to apply for the best facility that was fit for my certificate. If you used any Career Center services, resources, or events to obtain your experiential learning opportunity, what were they? I have used The Career Center to work on my résumé, which was very useful as they showed me how to have a professional résumé and helped me determine what to include. Describe some of your responsibilities or duties during your experiential learning opportunity, and what a typical day was like "on the job". I had to work with children and take care of them throughout the day at the facility. The children were two years old, so it came with a lot of responsibility. The responsibilities included making sure their daily needs were met; showing good communication skills; practicing speaking, writing and communication; making sure good relationships were used within the classroom; as well as developing good social skills and a foundational education. I would arrive and have to look after the children, either when it was circle time, eating, using the restroom, play time, or learning new things. The children would usually go in around 8 a.m. and leave at 5 p.m. while nap time took place from 12:30 to 3 p.m. There were many activities that were done throughout the day, as well as reading time, play time, meal and snack time. What are some major takeaways from your experience? How will these help prepare you for the next step after graduation? One major takeaway is how much I enjoyed this experience. I learned a lot about children, working with others, maintaining a good work ethic and schedule, and my future career in general. This will help me in the next steps after graduating as I have a better idea of my interests, capabilities and inspirations in this career path. Did this experience help clarify your career path? If yes, how so? It has, as I have learned that this is something I genuinely enjoy and can see myself doing in the future. It has pushed me to think about what I am capable of doing and what I can accomplish in the future.
