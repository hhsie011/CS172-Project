The GayogoÌ±hÃ³êž‰nÇ«' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of GayogoÌ±hÃ³êž‰nÇ«' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of GayogoÌ±hÃ³êž‰nÇ«' people, past and present, to these lands and waters.
