The magnitude and complexity of environmental problems are creating a growing need for scientists with rigorous, interdisciplinary training in environmental science. The Environmental Science program is designed to prepare students for positions of leadership in this rapidly changing discipline. Environmental Science graduates have a solid foundation in biological and physical natural sciences and the specialized training necessary for integrated analysis of environmental systems. Undergraduate Study The Environmental Science undergraduate major is offered through both the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. Environmental Science majors complete foundation courses in biology, chemistry, earth science, geology, physics and mathematics, plus a major consisting of an integrated core of Environmental Science courses and additional advanced course work in Environmental Science. Scientific rigor is stressed throughout the program, beginning with the foundation courses in the first two years of the curriculum. The upper level core courses emphasize a dynamic systems approach that provides a framework for integrating physical, chemical, and biological aspects of environmental systems. Student Learning Outcomes Upon graduation, students should be able to: Demonstrate a broad understanding of environmental systems and issues utilizing an interdisciplinary framework to integrate ideas and concepts from biological and physical natural sciences Demonstrate proficiency in data analysis and problem-solving of relevant environmental systems/problems Use a systems approach to conduct integrated, quantitative, and interdisciplinary analyses and modeling of environmental systems and problems From the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences http://www.ensci.iastate.edu Students seeking an Environmental Science major complete the following: 1.
