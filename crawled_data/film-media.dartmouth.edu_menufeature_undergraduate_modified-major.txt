Past students have successfully modified Film and Media Studies with English, Computer Science, African and African American Studies, and many other disciplines. Students wishing to pursue a Modified Major in Film and Media Studies must secure the approval of both the Film and Media Studies Department and the secondary department. As part of that approval process, students hoping to complete a Modified Major must submit a written rationale clearly delineating how each proposed course beyond our Department complements their Film and Media studies, and how the individual courses work together to form a cohesive whole. Students intending to pursue a Modified Major must meet with the department Chair to discuss their planned course of study previous to submitting a plan in DartWorks, to ensure that your proposed Modified Major is rigorous, cohesive, and focused. When contacting the Chair please copy the department administrator so they can assist you as well. Students considering a Modified Major should familiarize themselves with the course requirements of the program. To help you with your planning, you may also wish to use our Film & Media Studies Modified Major Worksheet. Modified Majors are required to complete a Culminating Experience. For more information on our modified major, please contact our department administrator. MODIFYING ANOTHER MAJOR WITH FILM AND MEDIA STUDIES When Film and Media Studies is the minor part of the Modified Major, students must take a total of five courses: One prerequisite course: FILM 1, FILM 2, or FILM 3 And four other film studies courses of their choice. Students must file a detailed rationale for the modified major that justifies each of the four Film and Media Studies courses. For more information on our modified major, please contact our department administrator.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Film & Media Studies Undergraduate Overview Major, Minor, And Modified Major The Major Major Requirements Culminating Experience Culminating Exp.
