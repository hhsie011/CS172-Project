The well-rounded curriculum prepares graduates to make their way in today’s highly competitive music world. A unique feature of Yale’s piano department is the close collaboration between piano faculty members. Students have regular opportunities to play in master classes and receive supplemental lessons and chamber music coachings from faculty other than their major studio teachers. Additionally, many internationally acclaimed guest artists visit the School as part of the Horowitz Piano Series, giving recitals, lectures, and master classes. The Yale School of Music is an all-Steinway school, with regularly maintained pianos in all recital halls, studios, and practice rooms. faculty spotlight Sylvia and Leonard Marx Professor in the Practice of Piano Boris Berman Faculty pianist Boris Berman is a performer well known to audiences in fifty countries on six continents.
