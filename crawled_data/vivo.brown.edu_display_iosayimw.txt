Research Research Overview I am interested in intersections between geopolitics and architectural discourse in a variety of contexts--historical and contemporary. My current work focuses on Germany at the end of the nineteenth century through World War I, and its relationships with a variety of societies in Africa and Asia. Research Statement I recently published a new book, Colonialism and the Archive of Modern Architecture in Germany. The book reassesses the history of modern architecture in Germany in light of Germany's colonial encounter and the country's broader embeddedness in turn-of-the-century processes of global integration. I posit the concept of the archive as one way to globalize the history of German modernism. By looking at four distinct moments at which colonial interests converged with progressive architectural discourse in Germany, I reveal that modern architecture not only cannibalized some of the forms and practices associated with non-Western cultures and those produced out of European encounters with them, but also, more fundamentally, that this convergence helped to define the conceptual shape of modern architecture. A second book project investigates the effects of migration on the built environment in Barbados from emancipation to the present. I hypothesize that the landscape of incompleteness that characterizes the country can be understood in terms of 1) contemporary patterns of emigration, return migration, and flows of capital associated with these movements; 2) the tourism industry and its volatile economic system; and 3) patterns of land tenure and ownership that have their roots in the rigidly stratified plantation society of the past. A third book project currently underway is a critical introduction to and annotated English translation the first German language specialist texts on African architecture.. This project grew out of research for my first monograph and my discovery of four forgotten nineteenth-century German texts on African architecture. The essays proved to be very interesting as primary sources for my research on German colonialism and its impact on modernism in Germany but also as scholarly works in their own right. A longer term project explores the architecture of postcolonial development aid in West Africa in relation to colonial and modernist models, the critique of colonialism, nationalist movements, and the then-emerging rubric of development. Here, I am interested in a variety of international, pan-African, and national initiatives like the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture, and the Cocoa Research Institute of Nigeria, how their goals were translated into built terms, and how these earlier experiences differ from ongoing experiences with Chinese expertise and aid. Finally, an article about one of Nigeria's first modern female artists, the textile designer and art educator, Josephine Ifueko Omigie, is underway.
