We provide access to easy-to-learn yet powerful platforms such as Arduino and the Raspberry Pi, which are available in kits with electronic components for prototyping. These kits and the items below are available for checkout at both the Hill and Hunt Libraries. We have additional equipment not listed here (boards, sensors, etc.) that can be checked out for projects and even long-term use. This equipment can also support some electronics repairs. Contact us to ask about this equipment. Spaces Makerspace, D. H.
