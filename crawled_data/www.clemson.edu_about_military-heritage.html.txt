Current: Military Heritage A History of Service: Clemson University's Military History Clemson’s proud tradition of military excellence dates back to its founding as a military school for cadets seeking the highest academic excellence. In 1916, ROTC was instituted under the National Defense Act, and in 1917 the entire senior class enlisted in World War I. This was the first of many collective acts of bravery exhibited by Clemson University students and alumni. To date, more than 10,000 Clemson alumni have served in the armed forces, and more than 490 have given their lives to secure the freedom of others.
