Denning Technology & Management Program Director's Message About Steven A. Denning T&M Curriculum Program Faculty & Staff Admissions T&M Corporate Affiliates Denning T&M Program News I am privileged to serve as the Faculty Director of the Steven A. Denning Technology & Management (T&M) Program. Our team, Robert Burgess, Sheena Brown, Anne Lynch, John Stanford, and I, look forward to the exciting future ahead. The minors offered by the program – Computing & Business, Engineering & Business, and Technology & Business – equip the best students at Georgia Tech with the academic training and professional skills to pave their paths to corporate leadership. Thanks to our benefactor, Mr. Denning’s vision, we are now open to all Georgia Tech undergraduate students. Our corporate affiliates have been integral partners in enabling our program’s continuing success. We are thankful for our strong relationship with all 13 corporate affiliates; they include the Atlanta Braves, Boeing, Caterpillar, Equifax, Georgia-Pacific, Navy Nuclear Labs (NNL), NCR, PACCAR, Siemens, Southwire, Steelcase, Tempus Ex, and Ware2Go. The Denning T&M Program is pleased to report that a total of 26 students interned for T&M corporate affiliates during the previous academic year or began working for a corporate affiliate full-time in May 2021. Additionally, I warmly welcome our recently admitted Class of 2023. The admitted class of 67 students has an average GPA of 3.83 and spans 15 Georgia Tech disciplines. In maintaining our culture of excellence, we continue to seek feedback from our corporate affiliates, program faculty, alumni, and students on the program’s curriculum and activities. I look forward to continuing collaborations with all stakeholders of the T&M Program in enabling Georgia Tech to be on the leading edge of the intersections of technology and management.
