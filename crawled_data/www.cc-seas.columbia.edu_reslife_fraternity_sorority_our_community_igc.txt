The IGC also sponsors community-wide and philanthropic events. The Greek Judicial Board Serving under the IGC, the Greek Judicial Board is a peer adjudication panel that works with the Office of Fraternity & Sorority Life to mediate chapter violations of University policies and procedures. Members of the judicial board are selected in a highly competitive process. This process, as well as hearing procedures, are outlined in the Community Standards and Accountability Handbook. Order of Omega Members from any of the three IGC councils are invited to apply for admission into Order of Omega, a highly selective honor society made up of leaders in the fraternity and sorority community who excel both academically and in their extracurricular activities. 2020 InterGreek Council IFC President: Andrew Baran MGC President: Anthony Hildalgo Panhellenic President: Suzy Shin Board of Directors Director of Internal Affairs: Raghav Mecheri Director of Philanthropy: Kaleigh McCormick Director of Programming: Joan Martinez Director of Marketing & Public Relations: Nilofer Nobi Greek Judicial Board Chair: Peter Graber Order of Omega President: Sean Jung Questions?
