Over 1282 international students, from over 86 different countries, call Tulane home. Tulane's Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS) provides programming, visa services, and language/academic support to our international student population. International Student Application The process used to evaluate international applicants is similar to that used to evaluate the rest of our applicant pool. There are, however, a few pieces that require special attention or additional forms from international applicants. Instructions Please note our admission deadlines and observe them carefully. Transcripts, Secondary School Reports, and recommendations must be submitted directly by your school. They will not be accepted from a student or family member. All submitted materials must be in the English language. You should submit your completed application as early as possible to allow enough time to obtain a U.S. Visa. You are welcome to send application materials via postal or courier service; however, it is strongly recommended that you submit online. Components Application Checklist Lista de materiales 国际学生申请材料一览表 Checklist para a aplicação Başvurusu için Gerekenler Listesi 국제 학생 지원 시 체크리스트 1. Application All first-year applicants use the same freshman application forms. If you are applying as a transfer student, please review additional guidelines. 2. Secondary School Transcripts Tulane requires a certified copy of your secondary school academic record. Grades for at least three full years of secondary education are required; exiting exams alone are not sufficient. Tulane is familiar with the grading systems of most nations. If you have any questions or concerns about your grading system, please contact your admission counselor. This component must be submitted directly to the Office of Undergraduate Admission by a school official. 3. Demonstrated English Proficiency English language proficiency is required for admission to Tulane. TOEFL, IELTS, Duolingo English Test or Cambridge C1/C2 scores are required if you are not a native speaker of English. At home administrations of these tests will be accepted for the 2021-2022 application cycle. Successful applicants typically score 95+, 6.5+ or 115+ on TOEFL, IELTS or the Duolingo English Test respectively. For non-native English speakers who choose to submit SAT or ACT scores, a 600+ on the SAT reading/writing or 27+ on the ACT English waives your requirement for an English proficiency score. 4. Secondary School Report All first-year applicants must submit a secondary school report and/or an official letter of recommendation from their guidance counselor or head of class. This component must be submitted directly to the Office of Undergraduate Admission by a school official. 5. Certification of Finances International students must complete the Certification of Finances Form in order to complete their application for admission. We will not accept bank documents without this form. Tulane University offers limited need-based financial assistance to international students whom we determine to have financial need. To determine whether you qualify for aid, submit the CSS Profile by 15 February. 6. Optional Interview Tulane does not require interviews for international applicants; however, if you would like to request an optional informational interview with your admission representative or Tulane alumni, we will gladly try to accommodate you via Skype or in person, or, at certain times of year, via our virtual interview appointments. Non-native English speakers are also welcome to participate in third-party unscripted interviews using a service of your choice. International applicants may participate in an interview conducted by one of the following services as part of their application: InitialView Vericant Duolingo English Test These companies will conduct and record an interview with you and provide it directly to us for review.
