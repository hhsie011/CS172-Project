Newsletters Search Enter a keyword Search Spring 2017 College Tours 54 DDC high school sophomores and juniors took part in two separate overnight college tours during spring recess from April 10 through 12. The annual spring college tours are three days and two nights each with intense itineraries that include campus tours and admissions presentations at each of the colleges visited. These trips are a first for all of our students who would otherwise not be able to visit colleges before applying. The experience shows students the many higher education options that are available, helping them set personal goals while exposing them to the application process and expectations of life at college. 34 students traveled north through New York state for campus visits to the University at Albany, Purchase College, Iona College, Binghamton University and the College of Saint Rose. The other 20 students went south and west through Pennsylvania making stops at Dickinson College, Franklin & Marshall, Bucknell University, Swarthmore and Haverford colleges. Students most often remark that the trips are eye-opening, informative and fun. One sophomore wrote, “I love F&M now. The belief their President has that every student has talent… I never heard that before. It shows they really believe in their students. That’s my dream.” DDC’s college tours are made possible by a grant from the Macquarie Group Foundation.
