For information about how your courses count once they transfer over, contact your admissions counselor and we can help you get in touch with your academic student services center. How Pass/No Pass Works for Transfers to OSU All spring 2020 courses, including transfer courses receiving passing (P) grades will count toward degree requirements, including requirements where a minimum grade of C is required. The P/NP grading option converts assigned letter grades to either a P (passing) or NP (not passing) grade, both of which are GPA-neutral and ignored by GPA calculations. P grades are considered passing, and transfer courses with P grades will count in earned hours and toward degree requirements. An NP grade indicates “no pass” and indicates unsatisfactory work in courses on the pass/no-pass grading system. No credit is earned for courses with NP grades, and they will not meet degree requirements. Transfer courses with NP grades are ignored in GPA calculations. Transfer courses with NP grades are automatically excluded from the GPA and have an inherent “forgiveness” similar to courses with an original grade of D or F that are subsequently repeated and qualify to be excluded from the GPA according to the OSU repeat policy. Courses with NP grades will not count toward the maximum four course, 18 hour repeat limit. Repeated courses with a P grade will be treated similar to repeated courses with a grade of C or better, except that P grades are ignored in GPA calculations. Frequently asked questions How do P/NP grades affect my transfer GPA and scholarships? Transfer grades of P and NP are ignored in GPA calculations that are used for admission and scholarship eligibility. Electing a P or NP grade will not raise or lower your GPA. Some students may benefit by retaining letter grades in some classes to meet GPA requirements or for admissions and scholarships. How will Pass/Fail Grades affect my GPA? Transfer grades of F received in a pass/fail grading scenario are included in GPA calculations. What if I receive an “I” Incomplete grade from my former institution? Transfer grades of I are not counted in GPA calculations. What if I choose to withdraw from a course and receive a grade of “W” Withdrawal? How does that grade transfer and affect my GPA? Transfer grades of W are not counted in GPA calculations. Transfer grades of WF are converted to F if the hours are included in the GPA on the transferring institution transcript. More questions?
