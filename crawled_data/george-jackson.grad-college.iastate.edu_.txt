Jackson Research Symposium (formerly GMAP Research Symposium) March 17th: In light of the quickly changing environment associated with the Coronavirus pandemic and daily announcements from the university administration, the Graduate College and your Planning Committee has decided to cancel the Symposium. We may reschedule for a later date in 2020, so watch for announcements. In the fall of 2019, the planning committee unanimously decided to change the name from the GMAP Research Symposium to the George A. Jackson Research Symposium to honor the legacy of Dr. Jackson, former Assistant Dean of the Graduate College (1994-2009). Visit the Jackson Legacy tab to learn more about Dr. Jackson.
