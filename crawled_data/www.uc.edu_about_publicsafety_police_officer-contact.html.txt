The reports document the bi-annual review of policing practices, citizen contacts, and accountability measures designed to ensure that this commitment is upheld. The reports also briefly details the process and policy addressing bias-free policing at the University of Cincinnati and provide an overview of contact card data collected by UCPD officers. The reports, previously called the Semi-Annual Contact Card Report, were first published in 2017. Contact Cards were created in September 2015 as a way to better capture details regarding non-consensual stops. Officers are required to fill out a Contact Card during all non-consensual stops, including any traffic stop, suspicious persons contact, field interview or arrest in accordance with the UCPD Bias Free Policing Policy.
