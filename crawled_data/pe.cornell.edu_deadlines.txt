Physical Education Course Deadlines supersede the University course drop deadline. Know your PE course drop deadline to avoid late fees. Cornell Outdoor Education courses have different add/drop deadlines and policies. Drop deadlines are noted with class information on this site. Students may add and drop classes in B01 Bartels Hall or send an email to Danielle Ford at dmf238@cornell.edu. For other enrollment information, see their website. Enrollees are responsible for any course fees if the course is not dropped by the listed deadline for each course. Late Fees All post-deadline adds will be assessed a $50.00 late add fee. Please see specific course information, as numerous earlier deadlines exist. All post-deadline drops will be assessed a $50.00 late drop fee. Please see specific course information, as numerous earlier deadlines exist. Refunds: No refunds will be transacted after the course drop deadline. Non-attendance does not constitute a drop or exclusion from course fees and penalties. Changes: Students are normally not permitted to transact changes after Thursday, February 17, 2022 for the spring semester. However, changes may be transacted for legitimate documentable problems and conflicts. A $50.00 fee will be assessed. All course change activity after the last listed days to add and drop (Spring: Add - Monday, February 7, 2022 and Drop - Thursday, February 17, 2022) must be transacted through the Physical Education staff only. All transactions must be done through 305 Helen Newman Hall. Please contact Pat Ackley in the office by email at par2@cornell.edu. After Cornell Outdoor Education's drop date, students must contact Danielle Ford at dmf238@cornell.edu. Withdrawal If a student withdraws after the published Physical Education course deadline, the student is responsible for the course fee and a late drop fee. If the student withdraws from the course prior to the published University Course Drop Deadline, the course will not appear on the student's transcript. If the student withdraws from the course after the published University Course Drop Deadline, a W will appear on the student's transcript. If a student wishes to withdraw from a course to avoid a failing grade, they must do so before the last scheduled class of the course. Once a course is completed for the semester, no further drops or withdrawals are permitted.
