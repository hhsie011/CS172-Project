Get to a Safe Place After experiencing a traumatizing event such as sexual assault, it can be important to find a place where you feel comfortable and safe from harm. This location could be: Home Friend’s room Local hospital Police station If you would like to have a survivor advocate meet or accompany you to a local hospital or New York City police precinct, call (212) 854-4357 (24/7, 365 days a year). 2.

Morningside (212) 854-7233 Manhattanville (212) 854-7233 Medical Center (212) 305-8100 Call a confidential Survivor Advocate or Peer Advocate from Sexual Violence Response at (212) 854-4357 (available 24/7/365). You have the option of working with a staff survivor advocate or, when available, a peer advocate. Both are confidential and certified by the New York City Department of Health to address issues of violence. They can provide crisis intervention and will discuss options for reporting and seeking medical help. They help survivors make informed decisions about their medical, legal, and disciplinary options. Advocates can accompany students to on- and off-campus resources such as hospital emergency departments, the police, the district attorney's office, and Columbia Public Safety. To speak with non-Columbia resources, you may call any of these hotlines for assistance. These include local and national resources for survivors of sexual assault and other forms of gender- and power-based violence. 3. Seek Medical Attention, If Necessary To check for injuries; you may have injuries that you can't see or feel To prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and obtain prophylaxis medication To prevent pregnancy To collect evidence (evidence collection does not require you to place a report with the police; this process preserves evidence for the future and it may vary by state.) Medical Resources Columbia Health Medical Services (Morningside, Manhattanville campuses) Student Health on Haven (Medical Center Campus) Barnard Primary Care Health Service Mount Sinai Morningside Emergency Department: (212) 523-3330, West 114th and Amsterdam Mount Sinai West Emergency Department: (212) 523-6800, 59th & 10th Avenue Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center: Domestic and Other Violent Emergencies (DOVE): (212) 305-9060, West 168th and Broadway Crime Victims Treatment Center at Mount Sinai Morningside: (212) 523-4728 – call for appointment Monday- Friday, 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM If you would like to have a confidential survivor advocate meet or accompany you to a local hospital, call (212) 854-4357 (24/7, 365 days a year). 4. Preserve Evidence For the purposes of evidence collection, if possible, avoid: Drinking Eating Showering Brushing your teeth Combing your hair Changing or washing your clothes If you have done any of these things, evidence can still be collected and remains important in seeking medical attention. If you have changed your clothes, take the clothes you were wearing at the time of the assault to the hospital in a paper bag (not a plastic bag). If you have not changed your clothes, it may be a good idea to bring a change of clothes to the hospital. If needed, a survivor advocate from Sexual Violence Response can provide you with needed clothing or other items from the Survivor Care Package. 5. Consider Talking with a Counselor Counseling is often helpful for survivors because it provides a safe place to talk about your experience and your feelings.
