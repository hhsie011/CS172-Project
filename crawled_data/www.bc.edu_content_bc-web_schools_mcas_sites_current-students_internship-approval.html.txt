Students are expected to guide their unique search for an internship and may choose to partner with the Career Center as they investigate possible internship opportunities. Students may apply to earn academic credit for an internship experience in the fall or spring semesters or during the summer. Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences undergraduates are eligible to earn up to three, pass/fail, internship credits to be counted toward their 120 credits required for graduation so long as no more than 18 total pass/fail credits are being counted toward graduation. These internship credits do not count toward major, minor, or University core requirements. Upon internship approval, the student will be enrolled for UNAS4197 Internship One, UNAS4198 Internship Two, or UNAS4199 Internship Three for the semester during which the student has the internship. A student’s first summer internship credit (UNAS4197) is non-tuition bearing. Students choosing to earn credit for a second (UNAS4198) or third (UNAS4199) summer internship experience will be charged by the credit hour during the summer of the internship. Upon written verification by the internship supervisor that the student successfully completed the responsibilities of the internship, a passing grade will be recorded on the student’s transcript. If the student does not fulfill the responsibilities of the internship experience, a failing grade will be recorded. With written approval of the internship supervisor, a student enrolled in a one-credit internship may withdraw from the internship through the University course withdraw process, subject to the standard deadline. In such cases, a W will be recorded on the student’s transcript. To be approved to receive one credit for an internship in The Morrissey College of Arts & Sciences, students must: Commit to a minimum of 50 hours to the internship experience Complete the Internship Approval process including the Internship Information & Supervisor’s Approval form Have not already earned a total of 3, one-credit internships and/or 18 pass/fail credits Internship Approval For further questions regarding internship credit in the Morrissey College of Arts & Sciences, please contact Dr. Elizabeth Bracher, elizabeth.bracher@bc.edu.
