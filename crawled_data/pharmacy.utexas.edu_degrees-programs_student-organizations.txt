Students are strongly encouraged to become actively involved in one or more professional organizations, which provide programs and activities to assist members in achieving practice excellence and professional growth. Members have opportunities to participate in community outreach projects and to network with other professionals with interests in their chosen area of study and research. Student Professional Organizations The training of a pharmacist, not only to become a good practitioner of pharmacy, but also to become a leader in the community, is derived from classroom and internship experiences, but also through activity in professional organizations. Organizations range from opportunities to participate in student governance, to professional pharmacy fraternities, to a number of specialty groups and beyond. Participation in professional organizations benefit students both while they are in school and after they graduate.
