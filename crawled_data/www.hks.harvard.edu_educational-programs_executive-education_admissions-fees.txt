Executive Education programs at Harvard Kennedy School offer you an exceptional and enriching learning experience that can't be duplicated anywhere else. Bringing together participants with a range of experiences and multiple perspectives is crucial to developing public leaders and advancing public purpose in all sectors of society. Executive Education cohorts are carefully selected and encompass a variety of backgrounds, sectors, functions, and geography. Though the programs do not have formal education requirements, participants are typically senior-level executives and skillful public leaders with more than 10 years of experience. Application Deadlines Please visit the program page for specific deadlines. Application deadlines are generally two months in advance of the program start date. Programs often fill to capacity, so early application is recommended. Early application does not guarantee admission. Notification of Acceptance For most programs, qualified candidates are admitted on a rolling, space-available basis. Once the review process has begun, applicants are typically notified within three weeks via email regarding the Admissions Committee's decision. This timeframe may be extended due to the volume of applications or the date of the program.
