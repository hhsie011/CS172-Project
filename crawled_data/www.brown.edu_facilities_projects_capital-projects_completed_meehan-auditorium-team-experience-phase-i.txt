Meehan. The auditorium serves as the home for the Brown men’s and women’s ice hockey teams and their coaches. As the oldest building on the Ittleson Quadrangle, Meehan is located on the northwest corner of the quadrangle, near the intersection of Lloyd Avenue and Hope Street. Gilbane Building Company, the original builders of Meehan, along with Architectural Resources Cambridge (ARC) are currently in Phase 1 of a phased renewal plan for the structure. Phase 1 will address the team experience with a focus on upgrades to locker rooms and the Davis Lounge, along with core renewal upgrades to the arena HVAC systems. These upgrades will provide improvements for campus hockey programs, players and coaches. Construction commenced in April 2021 and interior completion is planned for late August 2021, in time for the hockey season. Final HVAC modifications will take place during a break in the hockey season in December, and be completed by 12/31/2021. The program is in alignment with Brown's strategic plan Building on Distinction: A New Plan for Brown (2013). Construction on Phase I is expected to be completed in time for the beginning of the academic 2021/22 year opening.
