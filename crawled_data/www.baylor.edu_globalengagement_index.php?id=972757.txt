Here, you can find all of the resources that we would normally cover during the program director development training session. I will be adding to this site constantly to make sure that you have everything that you need. If there is something that you have questions on and you believe should be here, please let me know and I can add them to the portal. I know many of you are as tired of long Zoom meetings as I am, so, rather than make you sit through a two-hour-long Zoom session with me, I decided to record myself presenting the materials from Director Development and upload them here. That way you have easy access to the content can go through them as you need it, and always have it available for reference. All of these videos are short, about 5-15 minutes each, and are broken down into what I think are manageable sections - you can thank me by taking me with you on your program!!! As always, if there is ever anything you need help with, please feel free to reach out and I would be happy to meet with you! Click here to schedule a meeting with the Coordinator for Study Abroad Once you have finished watching the PD Development Videos, please fill out the feedback form at the bottom to let me know you have completed watching the videos and to let me know what I can do to improve in the future!
