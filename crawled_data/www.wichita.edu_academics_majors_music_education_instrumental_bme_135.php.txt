Admission requirements Inside the Program Playing the trumpet is easier with WSU invention Music education majors have the opportunity to learn from innovative faculty members. David Hunsicker is not only a longtime musician. The associate professor of trumpet is also an inventor and business owner. Hunsicker partnered with WSU’s National Institute for Aviation Research and WSU Ventures to create the Gapper, a flexible plastic device that allows musicians to control the third valve slide. Hunsicker says the ring on the third valve slide tends to be too big for musicians with smaller hands. The gap between the finger and the ring causes a delay in moving the slide, which results in a missed note. The Gapper fixes that problem. Curriculum The instrumental curriculum is divided into general education, music performance, music theory and history, and music education—including applied learning in K-12 classrooms—equipping you with the knowledge, skills and confidence needed to start your successful teaching career.
