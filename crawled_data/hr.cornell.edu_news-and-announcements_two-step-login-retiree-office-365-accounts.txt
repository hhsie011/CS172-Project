How the Change Will Affect You If you have recently retired from Cornell, you may already be familiar with Two-Step Login from accessing resources like Faculty Center or Canvas before your retirement. Two-Step Login protection for Office 365 uses a very similar process. Over ten thousand Cornell Office 365 users have already transitioned to using Two-Step Login without issues. If you are not familiar with the service, please visit Two-Step Login for general information. For details about the upcoming change, visit Before You Start Using Two-Step Login with Office 365. Two-Step Login will not increase how often you need to log in to Outlook -- it simply adds an additional authentication step when you do. Because Office 365 remembers you if you connect regularly using the same app on the same computer or mobile device, you may rarely, if ever, actually need to log in and re-authenticate with Two-Step Login. (An example of when you might would be when installing a fresh copy of the software.) But don't worry – Two-Step Login is still providing its extra protection against malicious users. If you use Outlook on the web, if you usually need to sign in there, then you will also be prompted to complete Two-Step Login as well. Is There Anything Special You Need to Know? If you access Cornell email using one of the following methods, you will need to take extra steps to ensure your email access transitions smoothly. iOS Devices If you use the iOS Apple Mail and Calendar app to access Cornell email, you may need to refresh your account settings. Follow the instructions to Configure the Apple iOS Mail and Calendar App for Use with Two-Step Login. Unsupported Email and Calendar Clients Cornell only supports email and calendar apps from Microsoft and Apple for Two-Step Login. While other apps, such as Gmail for Android or Thunderbird, may continue to work if configured carefully by experienced users, you are encouraged to switch to a supported client. Review the list of supported clients at Before You Start Using Two-Step Login with Office 365. SMTP and IMAP/POP Protocols If you use IMAP/POP or SMTP protocols to connect to Cornell email, the most common Basic authentication method to send or read email is not compatible with Two-Step Login. You will need to take steps to use an OAuth2-supported email client configured for an Exchange account. For this reason, users are encouraged simply to switch to a supported client as detailed at Before You Start Using Two-Step Login with Office 365. Office 2013 and Older On Windows and macOS, you will need to have Office 2016 or later to be compatible with Two-Step Login. Forwarded Email If you forward your Cornell email to another email service and do not connect directly, you will not be affected by this requirement.

You can enable Two-Step Login for Office 365 in advance of the June 8 deadline by following the steps described at Opt-In to Two-Step Login for Office 365.
