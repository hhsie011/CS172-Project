As a one-semester introduction to material often covered in two semesters, this course carries two credit hours instead on one. The workload for this course is correspondingly heavy; students may expect an average of ten hours of homework—including memorization, practice, and preparation of vocabulary and grammar—per week. There are no prerequisites for this course. LATN 0110 S01 Primary Instructor Vitas Essentials of the Latin Language Second course in an intensive two-semester approach to Latin. Special emphasis on developing facility in the rapid reading of Latin literature. No previous knowledge of Latin is required prior to taking this two course sequence. LATN 0200 S01 Primary Instructor Ell Introduction to Latin Literature Introduction to Latin literature through intensive reading of major authors in prose and poetry with careful attention to grammar and style. Prerequisite: LATN 0100, 0200 or 0110 (or equivalent). LATN 0400 S01 Primary Instructor Butler Seneca Philosopher, statesman, teacher, husband, and friend, Seneca (the Younger) was respected in his life and revered for his spectacularly Stoic death. This course will introduce students to aspects of Senecan thought, style, and influence while refining general facility with Latin. LATN 1060K S01 Primary Instructor Eccleston Catilines: Cicero and Sallust Close readings of selections from Cicero's Catilinarians and Sallust's Bellum Catilinae. We will explore how two contemporary authors responded to the same historical event: the Catilinarian conspiracy. We will consider not only the differences of genre (political speech v. historical monograph), but also the ways in which each author's involvement affected the content of his presentation. Additionally, we will examine Sallust's and Cicero's distinctive positions on Latin diction and stylistics. Prerequisite: Knowledge of elementary Latin grammar and intermediate Latin reading skills. LATN 1110R S01 Primary Instructor Russell Alcuin Alcuin lived a life of wide variety and accomplishment, not least as an important member of Charlemagne's inner circle and, like many at court, he wrote widely and in multiple genres. From his enormous output this course will focus on the large collections of poetry and letters. We will attend in both gatherings to theme, tone, style, and allusivity and, where appropriate, we will ponder alternate readings in a collection that has not been edited since the late nineteenth century. LATN 1120D S01 Primary Instructor Pucci Latin Prose Composition Review of the basic tenets of Latin syntax, composition, and style. English to Latin translation exercises will shore up composition skills, as we study the stylistic traits of seven Roman authors: Cato, Caesar, Cicero, Sallust, Livy, Seneca, and Tacitus. The course will proceed chronologically according to author. Class time will be spent on translation exercises and review, as well as the identification of the stylistic and syntactic characteristics of the seven authors under study.
