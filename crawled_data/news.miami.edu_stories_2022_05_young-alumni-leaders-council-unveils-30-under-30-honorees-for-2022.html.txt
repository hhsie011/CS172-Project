Relaunched in summer 2021, the Young Alumni Leaders Council has wrapped up a successful year during which its members acted as ambassadors for the University of Miami while nurturing a culture of engagement and philanthropy among young ’Canes nationwide. The council’s signature initiative, the University’s 30 Under 30, also returned this year after a hiatus. The 2022 honorees—30 alumni younger than 30 years old who are making impressive strides in their professions and communities—were introduced at the council’s virtual year-end celebration on May 6. “Every year, a new class of ’Canes emerges into the world equipped with the tools to create lasting and meaningful change,” said Devang Desai, double alumnus and president of the University of Miami Alumni Association. “Young alumni are the future lifeblood of a highly connected and engaged global ’Canes community, and their leaders today are positioned to have a transformative impact in the future.” The 30 Under 30 program for 2022 began last fall with a call for nominations, from which the Young Alumni Leaders Council selected 30 exemplary ’Canes. This year’s honorees include educators, entrepreneurs, artists, community activists, budding philanthropists, a professional athlete, two members of Iron Arrow, and a legacy ’Cane. MacKenzie Green, president of the Young Alumni Leaders Council, hailed the 30 Under 30 for their engagement and dedication to making a difference in their communities. “This year’s 30 Under 30 class represents the best of young alumni—energetic, passionate, creative, and strong advocates for the U,” Green said. Nominations are now open for the 30 Under 30 program for 2023.
