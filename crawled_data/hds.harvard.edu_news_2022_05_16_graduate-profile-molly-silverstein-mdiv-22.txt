Memorable Moment I will always remember helping to build and decorate the HDS sukkah this year, a worthwhile comedy of errors that led to beautiful evenings shared with friends under a crisp September sky. Favorite Class or Professor Two classes from Professor Charles Hallisey's scripture series, "Buddhist Narrative and Story Literature" and "The Lotus Sutra," indelibly transformed the way I read and think. Message of Thanks I'm in awe of my brilliant classmates. Thank you for inspiring me and for being so much fun. I hope to continue to learn from you for many years to come. I'm grateful for the excellent mentorship I received in field placements throughout my three years at HDS. Thank you Rabbi Liza Stern, Stef Branca, Rev. Mary Martha Thiel, and Dr. Wesley Wildman.
