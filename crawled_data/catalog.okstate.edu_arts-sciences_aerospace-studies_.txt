Aerospace Studies Aerospace Studies Overview Courses Minors Faculty http://afrotc.okstate.edu/ Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) is an outstanding opportunity to commission as a United States Air Force or United States Space Force Officer. Through this program, you will hone your leadership, time-management and analytical skills, while also improving your physical fitness. If you meet military and academic requirements, at the completion of this program you will commission as a Second Lieutenant in the Air Force or, depending on your career field, the Space Force. From there you will have the opportunity to see the world and lead people in diverse career fields ranging from pilot, navigator, doctor, lawyer, program manager, space or nuclear operations, and many more. No matter your degree or life ambitions, there may be a place for you in the United States Air and Space Forces. Students complete one credit hour of basic Aerospace Studies each semester during their freshman and sophomore years. These credits consist of one lecture hour and two hours of leadership laboratory per week, providing an understanding of United States Air Force structure, history, procedures, military customs and courtesies, and military uniform wear. Students also attend two hours of fitness training each week in order to maintain physical fitness and meet fitness test requirements. Unless receiving scholarship through AFROTC, students are under no military obligation throughout this time. Students with an AFROTC scholarship receive $250-$300 per month subsistence allowance during their first two years at OSU. Students are required to meet academic and military retention standards in order to compete for the opportunity to attend Field Training following their sophomore year. Successful completion of Field Training qualifies them to enter the Professional Officer Corps (POC) as an upper classman. Upon entering the POC, students will complete 12 credit hours of Aerospace Studies during their junior and senior years. These credits consist of three lecture hours, two hours of leadership laboratory and two hours of fitness training per week, each semester. The POC provides students with increased leadership opportunities within the cadet wing, preparing them for commissioning as a second lieutenant at the end of their senior year. Additionally, all POC cadets receive $450-$500 per month subsistence allowance. Furthermore, all students have the opportunity to participate in various cadet wing-sponsored extracurricular activities throughout their AFROTC career. These include visits to active Air Force installations to gain first-hand knowledge of the duties of junior Air Force officers, often including incentive flights in USAF aircraft! Multiple scholarships are available for competitive applicants; from Air Force ROTC-funded, in‑college scholarships, to a four-year, no less than $2,000 per-year OSU Incentive Scholarship for the top students in each class year, and in-state tuition for out-of-state cadets in good standing, with intent to earn their military commission. AFROTC is available to undergraduate and graduate students with at least three years remaining at OSU. To get started as a freshman during the Fall semester simply register for the AERO1111 class and during the summer you'll be contacted about orientation events.
