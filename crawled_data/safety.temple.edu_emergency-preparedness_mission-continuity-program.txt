We need to be prepared to pivot. Temple University is a large and complex institution with many important facets to our mission. As an Institution of higher education, we are responsible for educating our students, contributing to groundbreaking research, maintaining the physical environment of our property, ensuring our financial health and providing clinical services to our community. Because we know that disruptions to any of these mission areas can happen at any time, we need to be prepared to continue forward regardless of what may occur. Our 5 Primary Mission Areas Academics Clinical Research Business Operations Temple University is committed to taking an innovative, forward-thinking approach to continuity planning. Our primary goal is to facilitate planning for any and all disruptions that may occur. No central, universitywide plan will be adequate to cover the diverse needs of all of our schools, colleges, administrative units and support services. We need your help. Help us add value by being a guide, a support and a partner in the continuity planning process. Enhance the capabilities of your department so that your team will be adaptable in the face of any circumstances and continue the mission of Temple University.
