Students will develop a specialization through coursework in their fields of interest. The program is augmented with classes in business administration, engineering, architecture, and other support areas as appropriate for specialization development. A minimum body of knowledge is required as a prerequisite of admission for students without an appropriate degree or substantial professional experience. Because of the important role of computing in the disciplines housed within the School of Architecture, all entering students are required to possess a portable, network-ready personal computer capable of running software appropriate to their academic program. No student will be denied admission to Texas A&M University based on inability to purchase a computer. Additional information is available on the School of Architecture website. This program offers a combined master’s degree program with the graduate programs in Construction Management and in Land and Property Development that enables students to graduate with a Master of Science in Construction Management and a Master in Land and Property Development upon completion of the combined (with thesis) core curriculum. A student must be admitted into both the graduate program in Construction Management and the graduate program in Land and Property Development before completion of this combined degree program.
