Announcements Despite the COVID-19 disruptions our wonderful students continue to achieve impressive goals. Congratulations to Margaret Geoga and Federico Zangani, who successfully defended their dissertations in the past month. Very well done, especially given the extraordinary pressures of this unique and challenging period. Regretably we do not have a photo of Maggie and her committee, but hopefully that will be remedied some day. For now a photo of her award for Best Student Paper at ARCE, just one year ago. Federico is shown with committee members Jim Allen (seated) and Matthew Rutz; Professor Jana Mynářová was unable to travel due to COVID restrictions and participated by video.
