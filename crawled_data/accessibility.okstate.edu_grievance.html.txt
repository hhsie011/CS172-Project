This can be done via email through the SAS department email, accessibility@okstate.edu. SAS will always direct the student to try to resolve the situation with the staff, faculty, or campus department first. Should the student not be able to resolve the situation or get a response from the staff, faculty, or department, the student will need to email SAS specifics and include the following: Name of the person or department involved Course name, number, and CRN if it is involving a professor Date of situation Location of situation if involving a campus location A brief synopsis of what occurred The desired outcome (for example, the chance to retake an exam with the accommodations) SAS will contact the person involved to discuss the grievance. If accommodations are not being made and a resolution cannot be achieved, SAS will contact the head of the department involved. If resolution is not achieved or the individuals involved are not satisfied with the resolution, the student may discuss their grievance with the ADA Coordinator, who will advise the student of the steps in the grievance process and receive their formal written complaint.
