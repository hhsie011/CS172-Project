About the Film The Drowning stars Julia Stiles, Josh Charles, and the up-and-coming, Avan Jogia. The film is based on the novel Border Crossing by award-winning British author Pat Barker, and adapted to the screen by House of Cards head writer Frank Pugliese. The Drowning is the story of a forensic psychologist who is haunted by his expert witness testimony that sent a young boy to prison for a chilling murder. When the boy later reappears in his life, he is drawn into a destructive, soul-searching reinvestigation of the case. An erotic thriller with no let-up in tension, The Drowning celebrates the genre with electrifying performances. Complex, riveting and unafraid to tread deep, murky psychological waters, this is a story of shifting identities that will keep you guessing until the very end. Praise for The Drowning “Superbly evocative filmmaking” David Edelstein, New York Magazine “Gordon tackles matters of crime, guilt, and redemption with a solid grasp of character and place.” Hollywood Reporter Bette Gordon is a director best known for her film, Variety, a beautifully seductive film about a woman who sells tickets at a pornographic movie theatre in Times Square and begins to follow a male patron. Luminous Motion was produced by Ted Hope and Anthony Bregman and stars Deborah Kara Unger in a breathtaking performance. Gordon's 2010 film, Handsome Harry, features a stellar ensemble cast including Steve Buscemi, Titus Welliver, Aidan Quinn, Campbell Scott, and Jamey Sheridan. Gordon's films have been shown in international festivals including Cannes, Berlin, Locarno, Tribeca, and Toronto. For more information, click here.
