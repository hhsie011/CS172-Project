Overview Courses Undergraduate Programs Graduate Programs Certificates Minors Faculty The Department of Human Development and Family Science (HDFS) is a premier academic program dedicated to the discovery, integration and application of knowledge to enhance the resilience of diverse individuals and relationships. The department prepares students to work with individuals, couples and families. The department's primary focus is on integrative approaches to developing and maintaining individual and family resilience. The distinguishing feature of HDFS is the interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary integration of instruction, research and application between and among human development, family science, gerontology, early childhood education, and marriage and family therapy. Committed to enhancing the quality of life of individuals and families by maximizing resilience and reducing risk, the Department of Human Development and Family Science provides a dynamic environment for life-long learners through engagement in: instruction that fosters creative and critical thinking for individuals in their professional and personal lives; research that contributes to the discovery of knowledge and understanding of human development and family relationships; and application of knowledge that is responsive to and informed by constituents' needs. The department offers undergraduate programs in early childhood education, early child care and development (online), child and family services, family financial planning and family and consumer sciences education. Each of these programs emphasizes integration of theory, research, policy and practice. Criteria for undergraduate students wishing to transfer into HDFS include a required minimum retention grade-point average. GPA Requirements for Retention Hours Completed Minimum GPA Requirement Less than 31 hours 2.00 31-45 hours 2.25 Over 45 hours 2.50 The early childhood education (ECE) teacher certification program provides professional preparation for individuals to teach infants through third grade. This option provides a foundation in child development to prepare students to design, implement and evaluate developmentally appropriate curricula for young children. An early childhood education (ECE) certificate is required to teach pre-kindergarten through third grade in Oklahoma public schools. All students completing the early childhood education option must meet Oklahoma State University and Oklahoma professional education requirements. The early childcare and development (ECCD) program is 100% online and prepares students to work in early childhood settings with young children. Early Child Care and Development specialists create environments that are healthy, respectful, supportive and challenging for each child. Specialists design, implement, and evaluate experiences that promote positive development in young children. Graduates are qualified to work in a variety of programs that offer early care and education such as infant and toddler programs, preschool programs, childcare centers and homes, military child development/care centers, before and after school programs, Head Start programs and related organizations. The child and family services (CFS) program prepares individuals for careers in providing services and leadership to children, youth, adults and their families. The course content focuses on individual development, family dynamics, family life education, policy, management, and professional skills in the context of the community. Career opportunities are in public and private social services agencies, policy and advocacy centers, and in business and industry. The CFS program also provides education for individuals planning to continue their education in graduate programs, medical school, law school or other specialized graduate programs. The curriculum focuses on developing skills in critical thinking, scientific investigation, and written and oral communication. Students are prepared for advanced education in such areas as family therapy, child life, medicine, physical therapy, law and psychology. This option provides flexibility to accommodate the student's particular area of interest or to meet prerequisites for a professional school. The family and consumer sciences education (FACSED) program prepares individuals to provide comprehensive knowledge and skills that will help individuals, families and communities make informed, healthy, research-based and practical decisions to improve their well-being, society and the economy. Two paths are available for career preparation: one for Cooperative Extension Services and one for secondary school instruction. In both, FACSED students take specialized coursework in apparel design and production, family science, hospitality management, housing and interior design, human (including child) development, nutritional sciences, parenting, resource management, textiles and educator preparation so they are equipped to work in educational settings where they will have a significant impact on the lives of others. A semester-long internship or student teaching experience during the senior year in an outstanding program completes the undergraduate university preparation. Upon graduation, students meet the employment requirements for the Oklahoma Cooperative Extension Service and/or the teacher certification requirements for the Oklahoma State Department of Education, depending on which option was chosen. The job market remains strong for both careers in Oklahoma and throughout the nation.

Admission to the MS program is selective and requires the completion of a bachelor's degree in Human Development, Family Science, Child and Family Services, Early Childhood Education, or a related area. Admission decisions are based on a variety of criteria, including grade-point average (3.0 minimum grade-point average in undergraduate work), GRE scores (minimum scores of 150 for the verbal section, 147 for the quantitative section, and 3.5 for the analytical writing section are preferred for admission; only required for MS DFS, MS MFT, and PhD programs), TOEFL scores (required for students for whom English is a second language, 79 minimum), three letters of recommendation, statement of student goals, and a résumé or vita. Admission is available only for the fall semester in the Marriage and Family Therapy option. Applications are reviewed for the fall and spring (on a space available basis) in the other five options. Students in each option take a minimum of 18 credit hours of department core courses designed to prepare them to integrate theory, research and application focused on reducing risk and enhancing resilience within individuals and among families across cultures and generations. Additional coursework (ranging from a minimum of 12 semester hours to a maximum of 44) in each option, approved by the advisor and student's advisory committee, is focused on integrating theory, research and application within the option. Three options (Early Childhood Education, Marriage and Family Therapy, and Gerontology) offer both a thesis and non-thesis option. The Developmental and Family Sciences option requires a thesis. The minimum number of semester hours required for each option is: Applied Human Services (33 semester hours for non-thesis plan), Early Childhood Education (30 semester hours for thesis plan or 32 for non-thesis plan), Developmental and Family Sciences (30 semester hours for thesis plan), Marriage and Family Therapy (63 semester hours), and Gerontology (39 semester hours for thesis plan; 36 semester hours for the non-thesis plan; and 36 semester hours for the online program through the Great Plains Interactive Distance Education Alliance). The Family and Community Services option offered online through the Great Plains Interactive Distance Education Alliance requires 36 hours in a non-thesis format. Graduates of the Applied Human Services option provide leadership in diverse human services careers. Graduates (a) demonstrate an ability to describe, discuss and integrate theory, research and application to address key issues related to individual and family risk and resilience; (b) establish a solid theoretical foundation in Human Development and Family Science, and (c) gain experiences and establish competence related to professional issues in human services. Students select a specialization area based on career goals and interests. The Early Childhood Education BS/MS option emphasizes child development as a foundation for the study and practice of professional education of children from birth through age eight. This program was designed for HDFS undergraduate students seeking both the BS and MS specializing in Early Childhood Education prior to entering the profession. The integrated program is designed to be completed in five years, including two summers, but the MS option is also open to graduates from other departments or universities. To help students gain a strong understanding of how theory and research inform classroom and professional practice, students take courses in history and theory, curriculum, issues and observation and assessment. Students also complete a field experience in early childhood education as part of the degree program. This degree program prepares graduates for careers including: early childhood teacher educator; staff training and development; administration and evaluation; child, family and educational advocate; early childhood consultant; early childhood classroom teacher (requires teacher certification prior to the MS program). The Early Childhood Education dual BS/MS option is available only on the OSU-Stillwater campus. The Developmental and Family Sciences option prepares students to describe, discuss and integrate theory, research and application focused on reducing risk and enhancing resilience. In consultation with their major advisors and advisory committees, students identify courses and experiences that focus on preparing for research-related careers and/or doctoral study. Coursework focuses on the integration of theory and research in human development and family science, research methods and statistics. Students complete a thesis and get practical research experience. The Developmental and Family Sciences option is available on both the OSU-Stillwater and OSU-Tulsa campuses. The Marriage and Family Therapy option is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Marriage and Family Therapy Education (COAMFTE) of the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy. The Marriage and Family Therapy option provides students with basic knowledge, clinical skills and a professional identity essential for entry level practice of marriage and family therapy. Students specializing in marriage and family therapy operate the Center for Family Services, an on-campus family therapy clinic. The MFT curriculum takes at least two and one-half years (including summers) to complete. The academic course work includes courses in systems theory, marriage and family therapy techniques, ethics and professionalism, and research. Course work provides a framework for the application of marriage and family therapy theory and research in clinical practice. In addition, all students are required to take at least 18 months of clinical practice. Graduation requirements include the completion of required coursework, a minimum of 500 client contact hours, and the completion of either a thesis or non-thesis plan. The Marriage and Family Therapy option is only available on the OSU-Stillwater campus. The Gerontology option engages students in an in-depth study of adulthood, the aging process, needs of aging individuals and family care providers, and services for aging populations. Students may complete the on-campus program (thesis or non-thesis) or the online master's program, a collaborative program of the Great Plains Interactive Distance Education Alliance (Great Plains IDEA). The Family and Community Services option focuses on the development and implementation of public, private and voluntary support services for individuals, families and communities. This program prepares individuals to function in a variety of occupations promoting family life and family/community well-being and is a collaborative program of the Great Plains Interactive Distance Education Alliance and is offered in an online format.

The Doctor of Philosophy Degree The PhD in Human Sciences with option in human development and family science (HDFS) is a research doctoral program designed to promote breadth, depth and integration of knowledge in HDFS through research collaborations. Doctoral students collaborate with faculty and other graduate students on research projects which integrate the theoretical and empirical knowledge base in HDFS and investigate key processes associated with risk and resilience. Upon graduation, doctoral students have the knowledge and experience to develop into leading scholars able to conduct high quality basic and applied research, to provide relevant instruction, develop effective interventions and contribute to the development of informed public policy that reduces risk and enhances resilience within individuals and among families across cultures and generations. The PhD option in HDFS provides students with the opportunity to concentrate on one of the following disciplines: Human Development or Family Science. Students are admitted to the program to focus in a primary discipline in the department (human development or family science) and to take additional course work in a secondary discipline (human development is the secondary discipline for family science students and family science is the secondary discipline for students in human development). PhD graduates are prepared to apply knowledge in human development and family science in a collaborative manner in diverse settings. To accomplish this goal, the program is designed around four primary themes: breadth (knowledge of substantive content across the two disciplines of human development and family science), depth (knowledge of substantive content within one discipline, either human development or family science), integration (knowledge synthesized to capitalize on the strengths of the disciplines of human development and family science) and experience (knowledge through involvement in research, instruction and a variety of applications associated with reducing risk and enhancing resilience of individuals and families). To achieve breadth, depth and experience in the primary emphasis area and in the integration between human development and family science, students take courses and participate in individualized experiences, approved by their major advisor and doctoral advisory committee, that guide the student in mastering the forms (teaching, research and service) and functions (discovery of knowledge, integration of knowledge, application of knowledge and transmission of knowledge) of scholarship expected of doctoral graduates in HDFS. Two options are available: 90-hour program for BS graduates and 60-hour program for MS graduates (with additional coursework possible for students with BS and MS degrees in other fields). Doctoral training includes participation in research throughout the doctoral program, a qualifying examination in statistics, and completion of portfolio documents designed to integrate knowledge from coursework and experiences and demonstrate attainment of doctoral competencies. Coursework includes a minimum of 15 semester hours in human development and family science content classes, 15 hours in human development and family science methods classes and research practica, 12 semester hours in research and statistics classes, three semester hours in human sciences and 15 hours of dissertation research. Students who did not complete a thesis for the master's degree are required to complete a thesis equivalent project (beyond the 60 semester hour requirement). Admission to the PhD program is selective and requires the completion of an MS in human development, family science or related field. Admission decisions are based on a variety of criteria including grade-point average (3.0 grade-point average in undergraduate work and 3.5 in previous graduate study preferred; 3.25 in previous graduate study required), GRE scores (minimum scores of 150 for the verbal section, 147 for the quantitative section, and 4.0 for the analytical writing section are preferred for admission), TOEFL scores (required for students for whom English is a second language, minimum score of 79 on the internet-based TOEFL), three letters of recommendation, a statement of student goals and a résumé.
