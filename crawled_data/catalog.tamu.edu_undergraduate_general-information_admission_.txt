U.S. citizens completing a non-U.S. high school program should refer to International Admissions for questions concerning transcripts, examination results, and foreign credentials. An application is reviewed to make a decision about admission after all items listed below have been received. The items must be received by the appropriate closing date to qualify for consideration for admission. In addition, freshman applicants must show proof of meeting the State of Texas Uniform Admission Policy to qualify for review. If you attend an out-of-state high school or are a home schooled student, you are exempt from the Uniform Admission Policy. Application submitted electronically via ApplyTexas, the Common Application or the Coalition Application Application Fee (check, money order, Visa, MasterCard, Discover or American Express)—All fees are nonrefundable Domestic Undergraduate - $75 International - $90 Guidelines for requesting application fee waivers: Fee waivers are not available for international students.

The Office of Admissions does not have access to your FAFSA or SAR, you must provide a copy as part of your application file.

Essays Freshman applicants are required to complete Essay Topic A. Transfer applicants are required to complete Essay Topic A. SAT or ACT Scores Required of all freshman applicants, including all international freshman applicants. ** Scores should be sent directly from the testing agency and must be received by the posted deadline to be considered. The SAT code is 6003; the ACT code is 4198. Test scores must be from a test date within five years of the date of planned enrollment. The highest test score from one test date will be used in our review for admission. Texas A&M does not combine test scores from different test dates. ** Due to the continued lack of availability of in-person testing opportunities, Texas A&M University will not require ACT or SAT scores for freshman applicants in the fall or spring of 2023. The submission of test scores will not create any unfair advantage or disadvantage for those students who provide them but may help satisfy TSI requirements if admitted. Self-Reported Academic Record (SRAR) Domestic freshman applicants must fill out and submit the Self-Reported Academic Record (SRAR) indicating coursework, credits earned, grades, graduation plan/diploma type, grade point average and a numerical class rank (if available) at least through their junior year. Students should have a copy of their high school transcript available to use as a reference when filling out the SRAR. If admitted, the applicant will be required to submit a final transcript with graduation date by August 15. Discrepancies between a student's SRAR and official final transcript will be thoroughly reviewed; depending on findings, this could result in a student's admission being rescinded. Freshman applicants who have already graduated from high school must also provide an official high school transcript with a graduation date as part of the application file. Access to the SRAR will be available on our admissions website when the application opens. Domestic applicants attending an international school which follows an academic curriculum patterned after the U.S. education system may fill out the SRAR. International students studying in the U.S. may fill out the SRAR. International students studying outside the U.S. must provide official academic records, see International Admission Criteria for details. The Office of Admissions reserves the right to require official transcripts from any student; students should check the Applicant Information System to ensure completion of their file. Freshman and transfer applicants who have graduated from high school at the time of application should submit an official high school transcript that includes grades and credits for all completed coursework, a numerical class rank (if available), date of graduation and graduation plan completed, or a certificate verifying completion of a GED program. Post-baccalaureate applicants are not required to submit a high school transcript as part of the application file. Readmit applicants may be required to submit a final high school transcript if one is not currently on file with the university. To be considered official, a transcript must bear an original signature of a school official or an original school seal. Applicants who have attended high school both in the U.S. and out of the U.S. may complete the SRAR provided the courses and grades are present on the U.S. transcript; otherwise, official transcripts are required. Details for providing international transcripts can be found under International Admission Criteria. For students enrolled in the U.S., copies of official transcripts from other countries will be accepted provided the copies are on file and verified by the U.S. institution. Faxed or emailed copies are not official and will not be accepted. Class Rank Students graduating from a Texas high school who rank in the top ten percent must provide both the Self-Reported Academic Record and a high school transcript noting the student’s rank and class size or a transcript with a letter from the school on school letterhead signed by a school official noting the student's rank and class size to qualify for automatic admission. Documents may be uploaded in the Applicant Information System for processing. Texas A&M's Office of Admission will assign a ranking to students from non-ranking high schools. Official College Transcripts An official transcript is required from every post-secondary institution attended even if the applicant did not earn credit, receive a course grade or the course is not transferable. Coursework from one college posted on the transcript of another college will not satisfy this requirement. Failure to acknowledge attendance and provide transcripts from all schools attended may be considered a fraudulent admissions application resulting in a denial of the application. A college transcript for dual credit coursework earned in high school must also be provided. Official paper transcripts are to be sent by the sending institution in a sealed envelope. The transcript will not be considered official if the student has had access to the transcript. Requirements for submitting international transcripts can be found under International Admission Criteria. Faxed copies are not official and will not be accepted. For students enrolled in the U.S., copies of official transcripts from other countries will be accepted provided the copies are on file and verified by the U.S. institution. Lawful Permanent Residents of the United States An applicant who has applied for or been granted Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) status in the United States by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is eligible to submit an application as a Domestic Applicant. To qualify, you must include one of the following with the application: a copy of both sides of the DHS-issued Permanent Resident Card, or the I-551 Entry Stamp and Immigrant Visa in the passport, or an approved I-797 Notice of Action or I-797C Notice of Receipt. If your parent is also a permanent resident, a copy of the parent’s proof of LPR status will be necessary to determine in-state residency for tuition purposes. Note: If you have applied for adjustment of status to Lawful Permanent Residency and have not received your LPR card or Notice of Action that says Notice Type: Approval Notice, you will be considered an international student once you are admitted to the University. There are certain requirements that international students must fulfill in order to enroll. Please contact International Student Services at iss@tamu.edu for more information about these requirements. Required Immunizations Texas Education Code (TEC) 51.9192 requires all entering students (under the age of 22) to provide evidence of vaccination against bacterial meningitis received within the last 5 years or a signed affidavit declining the vaccine at least 10 days prior to the start of classes for any given semester. Learn more about bacterial meningitis at http://admissions.tamu.edu/meningitis. Notification of Application Status Check the Applicant Information System (AIS) at applicant.tamu.edu to verify your application has been received and to determine if any credentials are missing or are incomplete.

If incomplete credentials are received within one month of the closing date, there may not be sufficient time for the Office of Admissions to notify applicants. All items necessary to complete an admission file must be received by the Office of Admissions by the closing date (not postmarked) to assure consideration for admission. Required Coursework Applicants who graduate from an accredited Texas public or private high school applying to Texas A&M University must have completed the Foundation High School Program preferably with the Distinguished Level of Achievement and at least one endorsement. The high school curriculum should be noted on the official high school transcript.

Freshman Admissions When all credentials necessary to complete a freshman applicant’s file are received during the admission application period, one of the following criteria will be used to determine who will be offered admission: Top 10% Applicants from Texas High Schools Applicants who are Texas residents or who are enrolled in recognized public or private high schools in Texas with a rank in the top 10% of their high school graduating class, on or before the admissions deadline, will be automatically admitted to Texas A&M University if they have successfully met the State of Texas Uniform Admission Policy and have successfully completed the recommended or distinguished graduation plan or the foundation distinguished plan. Choice of major is not guaranteed. Applicants must submit all required credentials and a high school transcript verifying top ten percent ranking by the closing date in order to qualify for automatic admission. Review Applicants Applicants not meeting the above requirements for automatic admission but who have met the state of Texas Uniform Admission Policy will be considered for admission by holistic review of their application file, provided they submitted all required credentials by the closing date. Information for all Freshman Applicants All applicants should use the application questions and the essay to present their academic background and personal strengths as well as personal circumstances. Letters of recommendation are optional. If an applicant chooses to submit letters of recommendation, only the first two received will be considered. The most helpful letters are from individuals who know the applicant well and who can write about what distinguishes the individual from other applicants in the areas of leadership, exceptional talent or special circumstances. Photocopies are acceptable. A competitive applicant who cannot be admitted to a major due to restricted enrollment will be offered admission to their second major choice. If the second major choice is full, then an alternate major must be chosen by the applicant after admission to the university. Notice of Admission Decision Texas A&M University receives many more academically prepared applicants for admission than we can accommodate. Admission decisions are made beginning September 1 and continue throughout the application period. A final decision may not be announced until early December for spring admission or late March for summer or fall admission. A limited number of applicants may be offered provisional admission that requires the successful completion of a summer school program at Texas A&M. In addition, some applicants may be considered for the Texas A&M Higher Education Center at McAllen, Texas A&M Blinn TEAM Program, Texas A&M Engineering at Blinn, Texas A&M Engineering at Galveston, Texas A&M Engineering at McAllen, or the Program for System Admission.

If you plan to apply to the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) program, you should select a major that would be a good vocational choice if you do not later enter the DVM program. Any major may be selected; however, some curricula more closely parallel courses that must be completed before applying to the DVM program than others. Change of Curriculum to Another Campus In addition to main campus, Texas A&M offers certain undergraduate degrees at its branch campuses, Galveston and Qatar, and the Higher Education Center at McAllen. While enrolled as a student in residence at any one of the Texas A&M locations, students may apply for a change of curriculum to another location for a future semester. Students must comply with the established change of curriculum procedures and requirements of their desired major, department, and college, and space must be available. Final approval is granted by the academic dean or departmental advisor for that major. Transfer Admissions Transfer applicants will be reviewed and receive a decision from the Office of Admissions provided they submit all required credentials by the closing date. Recommended/required coursework for all majors is available on the Transfer Course Sheets at http://admissions.tamu.edu/transfer/majors. Students are strongly encouraged to follow the guidelines and complete both the required and recommended courses as outlined on the Transfer Course Sheets and in the catalog. Applicants who begin a set of courses which have a two-semester sequence are encouraged to complete both courses in the sequence before planning to transfer to Texas A&M. Admission Criteria Transfer applicants should have at least a 2.5 grade point average (GPA) on at least 24 graded semester hours of transferable coursework at the time of application to be competitive for admission. Transfer admission decisions are made based on the college or major requested and are competitive; thus, admission standards may change from one semester to another. Preference is given to the applicant with the highest grade point average (GPA) and the most courses completed for the major designated on the application. Applicants who drop or withdraw from courses frequently and who do not routinely achieve satisfactory grades will be at a disadvantage in the review for admission. Spring grades may be used in the fall admission decision if requested by the Review Committee or in instances where the student did not meet the university requirements for review. Spring transcripts must be received by June 1 for review with spring grades. A complete application must be on file by March 1 to be considered for fall admission and to qualify for spring grade review. Spring grade review is not available for all applicants and is not an option for students studying outside the U.S. The entire application, including essay topic A, is considered in the review process. Some colleges consider second choice majors and some do not consider second choice majors. This is noted on the Transfer Course Sheets. The admission decisions follow the guidelines presented in the Transfer Course Sheets and the College Specific Information provided in the catalog. Space may be limited for those being reviewed for their second choice. Automatic Transfer Admission through SB 175 A transfer applicant who graduated from a Texas high school and ranked in the top 10% of their high school qualifies for automatic transfer admission to a 4-year university under the provisions of SB 175 if they meet the following guidelines: The applicant must have graduated in the top 10% of his or her high school graduating class from a Texas high school not more than 4 years prior to the semester for which the student is applying. The top 10% ranking must be stated on the final high school transcript, or the applicant must have been previously offered admission under the Top 10% rule to the institution to which the applicant seeks admission as a transfer student. The applicant must complete the core curriculum at a public junior college or other public or private lower-division institution with a 2.5 GPA on a four-point scale or equivalent. Transcript should note core completion. The applicant must expressly and clearly claim in the application that he or she is seeking admission under the transfer Top 10% rule (SB 175). The applicant must provide all of the documents required for transfer admission to Texas A&M by the posted deadline. Transfer requirements can be found at http://admissions.tamu.edu/apply/transfer. Applicants qualifying for transfer Top 10% admission under SB 175 will be admitted to Texas A&M but the choice of major is not guaranteed. Students desiring admission to Business or Engineering are encouraged to select a second choice major of interest due to the limited enrollment capacity in these colleges. For information concerning the Transfer Top 10% Admission, please see www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/81R/billtext/doc/SB00175F.doc. College Specific Information College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Transfer admission requirements vary for the different academic programs offered by the College. Transfer admission decisions are made by major and are competitive. Most majors have required and recommended coursework to be completed by the student prior to application. It is highly recommended that prospective students contact the academic advisor for the major of interest to inquire about specific transfer admission requirements. Students should also refer to the Texas A&M University Admissions website to review the Transfer Course Sheets for each major. Also, note that transfer admission GPA requirements vary by major and several exceed the minimum 2.5 GPA. Completion of the essay indicating why the major was selected and how a degree in this major will help meet career goals is required. For more information on transfer guidelines, coursework and contact information for all academic advisors, refer to the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences website. School of Architecture Applicants must have completed 24 hours of transferable coursework at the time of application, and it is recommended that these courses be selected from the degree program electives described elsewhere in this catalog. The essay is an important component in the review process and should explain why the applicant is interested in either the Construction Science, Environmental Design Architectural Studies, Landscape Architecture, Urban and Regional Planning, University Studies Global Arts, Planning, Design, and Construction or Visualization program. Depending on the program of interest, applicants with less than a 3.0 GPA are rarely admitted. For more information, visit the School of Architecture website. Enrollment in Environmental Design Architectural Studies, Landscape Architecture, Urban and Regional Planning, and Visualization is driven by available studio space. Additionally, there are eight sequential studios in those degree programs which makes it difficult for students that transfer with more than 36 hours to graduate in a timely manner.

Field of Study Curricula A Field of Study Curriculum is a set of courses that will satisfy lower-division requirements for a baccalaureate degree in a specific academic area at a general academic teaching institution. The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board publishes information about Board-approved Field of Study Curricula (www.thecb.state.tx.us). Texas A&M University complies with requirements outlined in 19 Texas Administrative Code §4.32 regarding transfer of course credit for completed or partially-completed Field of Study Curricula. Per 19 Texas Administrative Code §4.32, following the receipt of credit, “the student may be required to satisfy the remaining course requirements in the field of study curriculum of the receiving institution, or to complete additional requirements in the receiving institution's program, as long as those requirements do not duplicate course content already completed through the field of study curriculum.” Notification of Admission Decisions Transfer admission decisions are made through a competitive review process. Applicants are notified of the admission decision on a rolling basis throughout the application season. For those applicants requested to submit spring grades for fall consideration, decisions should be announced by early July. Additional Information for Transfer Applicants All applicants are encouraged to view the Transfer Course Sheets posted on the admissions website for information concerning required courses and GPA requirements for admission to a specific major. A 2.0 GPA or better on coursework in progress during the semester (excluding summer terms) immediately prior to enrollment at Texas A&M is a condition of admission. Grades for all transferable courses are used in the computation of the GPA. This includes: Failing grades, repeated courses, WF, Incomplete, etc. Grades reported as Incomplete are computed as Fs. Plus and minus grade designations are not used; C+ is computed as a C, B- as a B, etc. Credit by examination courses which are transcripted from other colleges or universities may be transferred if sequential coursework with credit is also indicated. If there is evidence that the credit by examination courses are part of the student’s program of study at that institution, credit will be awarded for those courses that meet the transfer guidelines. Note: Credit by examination will not count toward the 24 hours required for consideration for admission. Coursework taken as credit-by-exam must be listed as a specific course and course number on an official college transcript to be considered for transfer of credit. Transfer Course Credit Policies Transfer credit on coursework complete at the time of application to Texas A&M University is determined when an official transcript from the originating institution is presented as part of the application for admission or readmission process. An official transcript is required from every post-secondary institution attended (including dual credit earned in high school) even if the applicant did not earn credit, receive a course grade or the course is not transferable. The transfer of course credit is determined by the Office of Admissions on a course-by-course basis by application of policies set under the guidance of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, the Texas Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, and under the guidance of faculty within the academic colleges. Credit submitted for transfer must be on an official transcript received by the Office of Admissions from the Registrar of the institution where the credit was earned. Course content will be determined from the catalog description or the syllabus. The transferability of courses will be based on the criteria below. All criteria are intended to be considered together; for example, criteria 10 may be qualified by criteria 7. Undergraduate course credit will only be evaluated and posted for undergraduate applicants and undergraduate students, not for graduate level applicants. Credit from Institutions Accredited by One of the Institutional Accrediting Agencies A course that is normally considered as part of a bachelor’s degree program (not including the bachelor of technology or similar terminal degree) may be transferred. The following criteria, taken together, are used: The course is applicable to a bachelor’s degree at Texas A&M. The course is similar to a course or courses offered for degree credit by Texas A&M. The course content is at or above the level of the beginning course in the subject matter offered by Texas A&M. A course that is intended for use in a vocational, technical or occupational program will not typically transfer. In certain cases, credit for occupational skill courses will be considered. Transfer of this credit requires that the student’s Texas A&M major is engineering technology or industrial distribution or that the student’s major department and dean approve the course for use in the student’s degree program after enrollment. Credit for support courses such as Math, Science and English intended specifically for use in an occupational program will not be transferred. Credit for courses must be shown on the official transcript in semester hours or in units that are readily converted to semester hours. A graduate-level course will not be transferred for undergraduate credit unless approved for use in the student’s undergraduate degree program by the student’s major department and Dean. This also applies for a course offered in a professional degree program such as Nursing, Law, or Medicine. Credit by examination courses which are transcripted from other colleges or universities may be transferred if sequential coursework with credit is also indicated. If there is evidence that the credit by examination courses are part of the student’s program of study at that institution, credit will be awarded for those courses that meet our transfer guidelines. Courses similar to ones offered by Texas A&M at the junior or senior level transfer by title only. Such courses may be used in the student’s degree program only if approved by the Department Head and Dean of the student’s major field. Validation of such credit, either by examination or the completion of a higher level course, may be required. A field experience, internship or student teaching course may be transferred by title only. Credit for cooperative education will not be transferred. A course that is substantially equivalent to a Texas A&M lower level course transfers as an equivalent course. Two or more courses may be combined to form one or more equivalent courses. If there is doubt about the equivalency of a course, the Texas A&M department offering the course subject matter may be asked to determine if the course is equivalent. STEM courses are often referred to the departments for evaluation. As a general policy, credit for admission will be given for transfer work satisfactorily completed with a passing grade at another properly accredited institution. Grade Point Average (GPA) for any period shall be computed by dividing the total number of semester hours of transferable courses for which the student received grades into the total number of grade points earned in that period. Credit hours to which grades equivalent to Texas A&M grades of W, WF, F, I or U are assigned shall be included; those having grades equivalent to Texas A&M grades of WP, Q, S, X and NG shall be excluded. In any case where a decision cannot be made using the above criteria, the Office of Admissions will determine the transfer of credit based on University policy, previous actions of the University and prior experience. Resolution of Transfer Disputes for Lower Division Courses Between Public Institutions in Texas The following procedures shall be followed by public institutions of higher education in the resolution of transfer credit disputes involving lower-division courses: If an institution of higher education does not accept course credit earned by a student at another institution of higher education, the receiving institution shall give written notice to the student and to the sending institution that transfer of the course credit is denied. A receiving institution shall also provide written notice of the reasons for denying credit for a particular course or set of courses at the request of the sending institution. A student who receives notice as specified in subsection 1 may dispute the denial of credit by contacting a designated official at either the sending or the receiving institution. The two institutions and the student shall attempt to resolve the transfer of the course credit in accordance with the rules and guidelines of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB). If the transfer dispute is not resolved to the satisfaction of the student or the sending institution within 45 days after the date the student received written notice of denial, the institution that denies the course credit for transfer shall notify the Commissioner of its denial and the reasons for the denial. The Commissioner of Higher Education or the Commissioner’s designee shall make the final determination about the dispute concerning the transfer of course credit and give written notice of the determination to the involved student and institutions. Credit from Non-accredited Schools Students who transfer to Texas A&M from an institution of higher education that is not accredited by one of the institutional accrediting agencies may validate the work taken at the institution by one of the following methods upon admission: Successful completion of a comprehensive departmental examination or nationally standardized examination that is approved by the department. Successful completion of a higher level course in the same subject area when approved by the Department Head and the Dean of the college or school. Credit will be given to students transferring from non-accredited public colleges in Texas for work completed with grades of C or better if they earn a grade point of 2.0 (C average) on the first 30 hours of residence work at Texas A&M. Credit from Foreign Institutions Transfer work from institutions that do not follow the United States educational system with instruction in English will be evaluated on an individual basis. A-level examinations with a grade of C or better will result in the award of transfer credit. We do not award credit for Baccalaureate II examinations. Credit will be given for work satisfactorily completed at international institutions offering programs recognized by Texas A&M. Official credentials submitted directly from the Office of the Registrar and a listing of courses completed and grades awarded must accompany any request for transfer credit. Transfer work will be awarded by course title unless previous arrangements have been made using the Texas A&M University Transfer Credit Study Abroad Pre-Approval Form. Courses must be equivalent in character and content to courses offered at Texas A&M. Credit will not be awarded from international institutions which are not academically accredited by the Ministry of Education or other appropriate authority in the home country. No English composition courses will be transferred from institutions located in non-English speaking countries. American history and American political science (government) courses will not transfer from foreign institutions. Courses taken at language training centers or language institutes are generally not awarded transfer credit. A transcript from such an institution must be issued through the Office of the Registrar at a Texas A&M recognized university, institute or language training center. Credentials of all language training centers and institutes are carefully reviewed. Credit for Military Experience State law (Texas Education Code Section 51.3042) and Texas A&M University policy awards credit for military service to eligible veterans. To receive credit, student veterans must submit proof of eligibility to the Office of Admissions. Up to 12 hours of general elective credits may be awarded, as needed for the student’s degree plan. Proof of eligibility includes: DD Form 214 showing 1 year active duty and an honorable discharge OR Military orders OR Disability discharge documentation AND Documentation of high school completion (final high school transcript or General Educational Development certificate) Military transcripts are evaluated at the time of application and credit for military experience/training is awarded based on recommendations contained within the Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the Armed Services published by the American Council on Education (ACE). Texas A&M University will award KINE 198 and KINE 199 credit for completion of Basic Training if applicable to a student's degree plan. Credit under this policy does not prohibit Texas A&M University from awarding additional credit. The Military Transcript Credit Appeal form shall be provided to the Office of Admissions with approval of the academic advisor and veteran. Proof of eligibility includes: Official military transcript (JST or CCAF) Military Service Credits are irrevocable once awarded. Potential consequences should be identified and understood before a request is submitted.

In order for a student in residence at Texas A&M to receive credit for correspondence work toward a bachelor’s degree, he or she should: obtain advance written permission from the Dean of his or her college or school; present appropriate evidence of having completed the course. Testing Services is authorized to act as an agent to receive correspondence courses. International Admission Criteria Transcripts/Examination Results Official academic records (transcripts, marksheets, diplomas, etc.) are required for all secondary and any university coursework completed. Records should include all courses taken in high school and every college or university the applicant has attended. Official records require the original school seal or an original signature of a school official (Registrar, Principal, Headmaster or Director of Student Records, Controller of Examinations, or the Ministry of Education). Official records should be mailed from the school directly to Texas A&M University, Office of Admissions. Examination results should be sent directly from the examination agency. In addition to the original records in a language other than English, Texas A&M requires official translations in English. Translations sent directly from the institution attended or from a recognized translator will be accepted. Transcript evaluations that include a certified copy of the original transcript and a word for word translation from an evaluation service which is a member of the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services are strongly recommended and will allow faster processing of files. We recommend a document-by-document evaluation (with a GPA) for high school credentials and a course-by-course evaluation for college/university transcripts from non-U.S. institutions. Credential evaluations that include a word for word translation will be considered as an official translation but will NOT be accepted as a substitute for required transcripts. For students enrolled in the United States, we will accept copies of official transcripts from other countries that are on file and verified by the U.S. institution. Unofficial photocopies, fax copies and notarized copies of records, examination results or translations will not be accepted. Uploaded transcripts and diplomas indicating graduation from secondary school (final high school transcripts) will not be accepted. These transcripts must be mailed. Admission Criteria for International Applicants with U.S. Based Credentials International applicants who are completing their education at an institution that is accredited by the U.S. will be reviewed in accordance with the guidelines determined for domestic admission. However, these applicants must still meet international deadlines and testing requirements. (See item 2 below.) Admission Criteria for International Applicants with Foreign Credentials International applicants who are completing their education at an institution that is not accredited by the U.S. will be reviewed based on the following criteria: Academic Achievement International applicants are expected to complete an educational program that will allow them to be considered for admission to a university in their home country.

Academic Fresh Start Policy Applicants for admission or readmission to Texas A&M may choose to have academic coursework that was completed at least 10 years prior to their term of application removed from consideration in the admission decision (Texas residents only). All other admission requirements apply. Should a Fresh Start applicant be admitted, he or she will forfeit all credit earned prior to 10 years from the term of admission. Academic Fresh Start must be requested as part of the application process. It cannot be requested after an applicant is admitted or enrolled. Academic work done subsequent to ten years will be used in the evaluation of the applicant for admission. Applicants with subsequent coursework are required to submit the transfer application along with transcripts for all college level coursework as well as all additional required documents by the posted deadline. If a student does not have coursework subsequent to ten years, he or she will be considered for admission based on the guidelines for new entering freshmen, which may require, among other things, an acceptable SAT or ACT score that has been completed within the past five years, see http://admissions.tamu.edu/freshman/apply for requirements. Admitted Fresh Start applicants have “Academic Fresh Start” indicated on their official Texas A&M transcript, are required to satisfy TSI requirements, and will follow the academic requirements of the Undergraduate Catalog of record for the term of admission. Forfeited coursework cannot be considered as prerequisites but placement examinations are allowed for courses which were not considered for admission because of the Fresh Start Policy. Once admitted on Academic Fresh Start, the applicant or student cannot subsequently request that the Fresh Start policy restrictions be removed. If an applicant has used the Academic Fresh Start Policy at a previous school, the Academic Fresh Start will remain in effect at Texas A&M upon transfer. Note: For financial aid purposes all previously taken coursework will be included when evaluating aid eligibility. In addition, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) does not recognize the Academic Fresh Start program. Students cannot be certified for courses they have successfully completed. Students using VA educational benefits should coordinate with the Veterans Services Office. Entry to a Major – College of Engineering Students in General Engineering, Texas A&M Engineering at Blinn, Engineering at Galveston, Engineering at McAllen, or the Texas A&M Engineering Academy Programs pursue a common first year engineering curriculum to provide them opportunities to explore the various engineering majors. Students are introduced to the different engineering majors in the first year engineering courses, ENGR 102, ENGR 216/PHYS 216 and ENGR 217/PHYS 217. Additionally, students are encouraged to leverage additional resources, including the Career Center, faculty, and academic advisors, to gain more information about engineering majors. Students must complete the following first year engineering curriculum requirements over the course of at least two semesters before applying to an engineering major: two engineering courses, two math courses, and two science courses. The entry-to-a-major (ETAM) process enables students to take ownership of their future by identifying at least three majors that are a good match for their academic and career goals. The ETAM process is designed to place students in the highest rank major possible based upon academic performance, ETAM application content, and program capacities. Students are encouraged to be in a major as early as possible. Students in General Engineering, Texas A&M Engineering at Blinn, Engineering at Galveston, Engineering at McAllen, or the Texas A&M Engineering Academy Programs must be in a major by the end of the fourth semester. Transfer students are admitted directly to a degree granting major through the admissions process. Upper-Level Entry into Colleges of Architecture, Business and Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences–Biomedical Science School of Architecture Transfer Students Transfer students, who meet the University entrance requirements and who desire to enter a major field of study in the School of Architecture, will be admitted based on available space and current School of Architecture entrance criteria. Following admission, some departments place transfer students on a 2.5 GPA probation for a minimum of 12 credit hours to substantiate competency in required lower-level courses. Departments with lower-level classification will admit transfer students into the school with a lower-level classification. Students may apply for upper-level status after at least one semester at Texas A&M University. Change of Major Students currently enrolled in another major at Texas A&M University with fewer than 60 hours (fewer than 90 hours for University Studies - Global Arts, Planning, Design, and Construction) who desire to change their major field of study into the School of Architecture must fill out a Change of Curriculum application found on the Howdy portal under the "My Record" tab. See Student Rule 5. The best-qualified applicants will be admitted based on the number of spaces available in their program of choice. Enrollment in Environmental Design Architectural Studies, Landscape Architecture, Urban and Regional Planning, and Visualization is driven by available studio space. Additionally, there are eight sequential studios in those degree programs which makes it difficult for students that transfer with more than 36 hours to graduate in a timely manner. Mays Business School Lower-level business (BUAD) students are encouraged to complete the freshman and sophomore sequence of courses as listed under Program Requirements. The BBA Upper-Level (UL) entry requirements and application procedures are as follows: Admission: To be admitted to an UL BBA major, a student must be admitted to Mays Business School and have: Satisfactorily completed the following five courses: Course List Code Title Semester Credit Hours ACCT 229 Introductory Accounting 3 ECON 202 Principles of Economics 3 ECON 203 Principles of Economics 3 MATH 140 Mathematics for Business and Social Sciences 3 MATH 142 Business Calculus 3 Submitted application for UL admission no later than preregistration for the expected UL entry term. NOTE: For summer UL entry, all requirements must be completed BEFORE the first class day of the FIRST SUMMER SESSION. UL admission requirements include completion of the three remaining lower-level Core Business Knowledge (CBK) courses prior to or during the first UL semester. Business students must preregister for and complete the following three remaining lower-level CBK courses at Texas A&M during their first UL semester, unless satisfactorily completed prior to UL entry: Course List Code Title Semester Credit Hours ACCT 230 Introductory Accounting 3 BUSN 203 Statistical Methods for Business 3 ISTM 210 Fundamentals of Information Systems 3 BUAD students may preregister for UL business courses in the semester for which they have applied for UL. However, students who fail to complete UL requirements shall not be permitted to remain registered in UL business classes. Transfer Students: Transfer students admitted to Mays Business School enter as lower-level business (BUAD) students until they complete all requirements listed previously in item 1, at which time they may apply for admission to an UL BBA major. Transfer students may immediately apply for UL when admitted to Mays Business School if, and only if, they meet all UL requirements at that time. On-Campus Change of Major Students: Texas A&M students who change major into Mays Business School from another college or department at the University will enter as lower-level business (BUAD) students until they complete all requirements listed previously in item 1. Change of major students who, when admitted to the business school, qualify to apply for admission to an UL BBA major may do so. Junior- and Senior-Level Business Courses: Preference for available seats in junior- and senior-level business courses will be given to students who have been admitted to a BBA granting major in Mays Business School. All ineligible students who preregister for UL business classes are subject to cancellation of their registration in these courses. College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences A Biomedical Sciences (BIMS) major will be admitted into the upper-level courses according to the following criteria: Completion of a set of Common Body of Knowledge (CBK) courses with a grade of C or better in each course completed at Texas A&M. Any CBK course transferred from a community college must have a minimum grade of a B. For admission to BIMS upper-level courses, a student may have attempted a CBK course no more than twice. Course List Code Title Semester Credit Hours Common Body of Knowledge (CBK) courses BIOL 111 Introductory Biology I 4 BIOL 112 Introductory Biology II 4 CHEM 119 Fundamentals of Chemistry I 4 CHEM 120 Fundamentals of Chemistry II 4 CHEM 227 & CHEM 237 Organic Chemistry I and Organic Chemistry Laboratory 4 CHEM 228 & CHEM 238 Organic Chemistry II and Organic Chemistry Laboratory 4 PHYS 201 College Physics 4 PHYS 202 College Physics 4 MATH 142 Business Calculus Math 142, 147, 151 or 171 will count for the calculus credit 3 Total Semester Credit Hours 35 A minimum of 55 completed semester hours with a cumulative overall TAMU Grade Point Average (GPA) of 2.5 or better. Process: Each student upon completing 55–65 semester credit hours must have a degree audit to verify upper-level eligibility. (All students are required to submit a completed degree planner yearly between March 1 and September 30. Students are encouraged to submit their planners prior to September 1). The Biomedical Sciences Program will continue to accept changes of major into BIMS according to current Texas A&M University policy, but restrict changes of major into the upper-level courses (BIMS) according to the criteria listed in item 1. Students in other majors requesting a change of major to the BIMS program must fulfill the criteria in item 1. In addition, the dean must verify availability of resources necessary to insure the student’s full-time enrollment in required upper-level courses prior to admission to upper-level status. If such courses are not available, the student will be denied admission to Biomedical Sciences. To enter BIMS upper-level courses, transfer students must have: A minimum GPA of 3.0 in CBK courses with a grade of B or better in each completed course if taken at a 2-year college. A grade of C or better is accepted from a 4-year college. Transfer students admitted under another major and wishing to change into BIMS must complete one semester of graded coursework at Texas A&M University with a cumulative overall TAMU GPA of 2.5, as well as meet change of major requirements for current students. Texas A&M University change of majors must have at least 55 semester credit hours with a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0. Students seeking readmission will be considered on a case-by-case basis, according to current catalog policy. No quotas will be placed on readmission; however, the decision to readmit will be dependent on resource availability and University policy. Any BIMS student admitted to upper-level courses who then falls below the 2.5 GPA requirement will not be considered in good academic standing in their major and will be placed on college probation. Students who achieve less than an overall TAMU GPA of 1.0, in any semester, are not eligible for college probation or grade warning status. All Biomedical Sciences majors must follow established probation rules for the Biomedical Sciences Program. The Dean, Director or Department Head will reserve the right to waive CBK or GPA requirements within the criteria established in Texas A&M University Student Rules. No courses other than BIMS 481, BIMS 484, VIBS 310, VIBS 311, BIMS 120, or research/directed studies courses can be taken S/U to be used in the BIMS or USVM degree plans. BIMS/USVM probation is determined at the end of both Fall and Spring semesters. Students not meeting acceptable GPA requirements (cumulative 2.5 BIMS majors with 55 or more hours or cumulative 2.0 for USVM majors/BIMS majors with less than 55 hours) will be placed on probation for one semester. Students who achieve less than a cumulative TAMU GPA of 1.0 in any semester (BIMS or USVM) are not eligible for college probation or grade warning status. Any written correspondence from Texas A&M University regarding suspension supersedes departmental probation terms. Students may only attempt CVMBS courses a total of three times. Texas Success Initiative (TSI) The Texas Success Initiative (TSI) was instituted to ensure that students enrolled in Texas public colleges and universities possess the necessary academic skills to perform effectively in college and to provide diagnostic information about reading, writing and mathematics skills of each student. All undergraduate students who did not meet one of the allowed exemptions must take the approved TSI Assessment. Students who do not meet established cutoff scores or other approved exemptions for the TSI Assessment are required by Texas law to be enrolled in, and actively attend, an academic skills course and/or program each semester prior to completing all TSI requirements. Academic skills courses in each of the three TSI areas are offered by Texas A&M. Failure to meet the attendance requirements of the academic skills course will result in withdrawal from Texas A&M. The hours for these courses will not count toward any degree program but may count toward determining full-time status. See http://asc.tamu.edu/TX-Success-Initiative for specific information. Students required to take the TSI Assessment should provide their score reports to the Academic Success Center at Texas A&M University at the address below. Academic Success Center 1133 TAMU College Station, TX 77843-1133 Email score reports to: successcenter@tamu.edu More information can be obtained from testing centers at most Texas public colleges and universities or by contacting: Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board P.O.

Observation Verification Form (minimum 16 hours required) Recommendations: these evaluation forms should be completed by 1) a college instructor, 2) a dental hygienist and 3) an individual who has known applicant for some time; for example, an employer or supervisor. An application is valid for one academic year only. Official transcripts are required and will be accepted only when sent directly from each school the applicant has attended. It is the responsibility of the applicant to keep the application file current. Failure to supply grades, transcripts or recommendations may be perceived as an indication that the applicant is no longer interested in admission. Interviews Processing of applications begins the year prior to entrance into the professional program and continues until the class is filled. The applications are evaluated, and an invitation for an interview may be extended. The purpose of the interview is to determine the applicant’s knowledge of the dental hygiene profession. It also provides an opportunity for the applicant to see the facility, meet with the Admissions Committee and to ask questions about the Caruth School of Dental Hygiene program. All prospective students are encouraged to contact the college with questions regarding prerequisite courses or the program. To Access the Dental Hygiene Application Forms: The applicant will need to create an account on the Banner Admissions Management Framework (BAMF) website.

Mail forms and transcripts to: Office of Recruitment and Admissions Texas A&M University School of Dentistry 3302 Gaston Avenue, Room 525 Dallas, TX 75246-2013 USA Transfer Credit Transfer credit will be determined by each component in conjunction with the staff of the college on a course-by-course basis from official transcripts submitted in the competitive admissions process. Course content will be determined by the catalog course description or course syllabus. Course acceptability is guided by these criteria: Courses completed at regionally accredited institutions are considered for transfer if: They are acceptable as credit for a bachelor’s degree at a regionally accredited institution. Course content is at or above the level of courses specified in the requirements for admission. Courses intended for use in a vocational, technical or occupational program normally do not transfer; general courses within this type of program may transfer. Credit on the transcript must appear in semester hours or credits that may be converted to semester hours. Credit by examination courses may be transferred if accepted by another college and followed by sequenced coursework. Equivalency of coursework is determined by content found in catalog course descriptions or syllabi of courses. In case of doubt, departmental faculty will determine equivalency. The final determination is left to the Program Director. As a general policy, coursework with a passing grade may be transferred, but the applicant must keep in mind that admission to the hygiene program is on a competitive basis and grades of F are calculated into the grade point average. Course hours will be evaluated on a course-by-course basis but will be transferred as a block of hours, and the grades do not calculate into the GPA for the hygiene program. Online courses are accepted. Typically, credit will not be given for courses completed at institutions not accredited by a regional accrediting agency. The school does not accept non-credit coursework to be used in lieu of coursework taken for academic credit.

Credit earned by examination does not contribute to a student’s grade point ratio. The University awards credit for scores on certain tests published by the Advanced Placement Program (AP), the College Level Examination Program Computer-Based Testing (CLEP CBT), the SAT Subject Tests, DANTES Subject Standardized Tests (DSST) and the International Baccalaureate (IB) Program. Texas A&M also offers qualified students opportunities to earn credits by taking departmental examinations prepared by the faculty. Information concerning credit by examination may be obtained from Testing Services, (979) 845-0532. Please note these regulations concerning credit by examination: Test scores and/or credit eligibility must be reported formally to Testing Services for credit by examination to be awarded. Credit is posted to the academic record once appropriate scores are received by Testing Services, the student has officially enrolled in the University and the student has accepted the credit. For information regarding current procedures for accepting credit, please visit the Testing Services website. Students may not receive credit by examination for courses that are prerequisites to courses for which they already have credit except with the approval of the department authorizing the examination. A student may not have credit posted for credit by examination for a course in which he or she is currently registered. If a student has acquired a grade or exercised First-Year Grade Exclusion on a course, then the student will not be eligible to take the equivalent departmental exam. Eligibility will not be affected if a student has a Q, W or NG in a course. Please note that once any credit has been accepted it cannot be removed. Advanced Placement Program (AP) Examinations offered by the AP Program are administered during late spring by high schools. Students usually take the examinations after completing Advanced Placement courses, although experience in an AP course is not required. Interested students should contact their high school counselors for information concerning registration and test sites. High school students and currently enrolled students should have the College Board forward their scores to Testing Services, institution code: 6003. Advanced Placement scores of entering freshmen are generally received in July. Students will need to log onto their Howdy portal under My Records and then Credit by Exam to accept the credit earned via AP tests. Testing Services suggests visiting with your advisor before you accept credit. The following list includes all AP examinations currently accepted for credit.
