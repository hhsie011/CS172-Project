A relatively small enrollment of 30 to 40 students permits small classes and close contact with faculty. Applicants should have a good background in undergraduate mathematics, regardless of their majors. Students with backgrounds in advanced mathematics will find our program quite flexible. Visits to Brown and direct communication with the director of graduate study are strongly encouraged. The core courses are in differentiable manifolds, real functions, complex functions, algebra, and topology. Other courses offered each year are in P.D.E., probability, algebraic geometry, number theory and differential geometry.
