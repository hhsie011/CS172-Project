With respect and gratitude, it’s also important to pay attention to their plights and needs during and after the crisis, as well as to provide physical and mental assistance. There is no better time than now to focus on the long overdue issue of physician burnout and PTSD. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a psychiatric disorder that can occur in people who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event, also apply to the medical staff, and what are the solutions and suggestions if so? With these questions and thoughts in mind, Columbia Global Centers | Beijing invites experts in medical psychology from Columbia University and Peking University to lead us to understand the issue of physician burnout, and also to provide best cases of practice and approaches of PTSD interventions and suggestions for decision makers and leaders to improve the working environment for medical workers. This special program is part of the Center's webinar series. We look forward to your participation and interactions. Speakers Susan L.
