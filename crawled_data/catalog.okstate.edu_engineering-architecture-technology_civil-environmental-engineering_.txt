Engineering Overview Courses Undergraduate Programs Graduate Programs Minors Faculty Civil engineers build the future. The exceptional diversity of professional practice in civil and environmental engineering presents many career opportunities for students. The concern of civil engineers is infrastructure - the design, construction, management, alteration and utilization, which allows society to function. Civil engineers plan, design and construct, highways, waterway and railway systems, harbors and shipping facilities, systems for the treatment and distribution of water and for the collection and treatment of municipal and industrial waste, dams and hydroelectric works, airports and terminals, structures of every kind including buildings, bridges, towers, industrial plants, tunnels and subway systems, processes for the control of water and air pollution, and many other works of general benefit to society. The curriculum in civil engineering is based on courses in mathematics, physical sciences and engineering sciences. On this foundation, required courses equip the student with the basic skills needed for the professional practice of civil engineering and provide the tools for more advanced study. Engineering theory and principles are developed in a way that will encourage their application to the practical solution of problems. Program Educational Objectives The Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering degree program educates and prepares engineers who a few years after graduation will be: Contributing to society through the practice of civil engineering in a variety of contexts, including the protection of public health, safety, and welfare and the development of sustainable engineering solutions; Effectively applying and adapting the technical knowledge, engineering principles, communication skills and personal attributes necessary to be successful in the civil engineering profession; Advancing within their profession, including attaining professional licensure and positions of leadership; Exhibiting life-long learning, including the pursuit of advanced degrees; and Engaging with and advocating for the civil engineering profession. The curriculum is designed to enable students to satisfy the program educational objectives in conjunction with the student outcomes.

Eng Civil Engineering, BSCV Civil Engineering: Environmental, BSCV Environmental Engineering (EVEN), Minor The School of Civil and Environmental Engineering offers two programs leading to post-baccalaureate degrees—the Master of Science degree in civil engineering, and the Doctor of Philosophy degree. The Master of Science degree is characterized by a technical specialization in a particular area of study. The Doctor of Philosophy degree is designed to prepare students for research and for the teaching profession in engineering. Major areas of study in the School are applied mechanics, structural analysis, design, transportation, materials, construction engineering and management, geotechnical engineering, water resources and environmental engineering. Research is possible in all major fields. Master of Science in Civil Engineering candidates may choose either to specialize or to engage in a broadly based program of study, in accordance with an approved and purposeful plan of study. Admission Requirements Candidates for the Master of Science or Doctor of Philosophy degree should have graduated from a civil engineering curriculum accredited by ABET. Graduates from other curricula and schools should submit transcripts to the head of the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering for evaluation. Degree Requirements All degree programs follow an approved plan of study that must be submitted at a designated time. All programs are characterized by the flexibility available in a study plan that is designed to satisfy the particular needs of the student, while conforming to the general requirements implied by the title of the degree and specified by the University. The Master of Science degree in civil engineering requires the completion of at least 30 credit hours beyond the bachelor’s degree, including a research thesis for which no more than six credit hours may be granted. The non-thesis option (32 credit hours) described in the Graduate College section may be permitted at the discretion of the student’s advisory committee. The Doctor of Philosophy degree requires the completion of at least 90 credit hours of coursework beyond the bachelor’s degree, including not more than 30 credit hours for the research thesis. In addition, the candidate must meet the equivalency of the language requirement (six hours) in selected areas at the discretion of his or her committee to facilitate his or her research. Generally, official admission as a candidate for the Doctor of Philosophy degree in any program offered by the School will not be granted until a member of the Graduate Faculty in the School agrees to serve as major (or thesis) advisor for the prospective candidate.
