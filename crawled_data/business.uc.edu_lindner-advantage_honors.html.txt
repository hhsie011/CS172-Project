The first-year Lindner Business Honors class, Fall 2021. Lindner Business Honors seeks ambitious students who are intellectually curious and face new challenges head-on. We seek go -getters and promising leaders who want to hone their talents and take control of opportunities that will propel them into their future careers. If you want to be a future business problem solver, you might be a perfect fit for Lindner Business Honors. Continue a Legacy Honors at the Lindner College of Business is rooted in a rich history and visionary legacy. It’s the story of two, independent donors, Carl H. Lindner, Jr. (who founded Lindner Honors-PLUS in 1997), and Marvin P. Kolodzik (who founded Kolodzik Business Scholars in 2008), who led efforts to build the best honors programs in the country. They sought to attract top students who could develop themselves through innovative academic and experiential opportunities. Since the founding of our honors programs, the Lindner College of Business has grown both in size and academic merits — thanks in large part to their success! Honors students and alumni continually thrive, achieving in their careers, breaking into new frontiers, and elevating their own and the college’s reputation. Our honors applicants are stronger than ever — and demand leading-edge education, innovative experiences, and a supporting community to freely explore and design their own paths. In 2021, the college refocused Honors to provide a unified, accelerated curriculum designed to surpass other top business schools and provide our honors students the best of all of our legacy programs. Student Testimonials “When deciding on a college, it was imperative that I felt accepted and heard. The University of Cincinnati was one of the only schools I saw a genuine effort to provide an inclusive community for their students. Since being here, I have been immersed in a culture of excellence. Through my Business Fellows Program and Lindner Business Honors Program, I feel surrounded by like-minded individuals with similar goals and experiences. Overall, I have met so many incredible individuals and learned so much. There are so many opportunities through these programs, and I can’t wait to be a part of them all.” — Keke Slaughter, first-year Business Honors student read more student testimonials Program Overview Lindner Business Honors attracts students who demonstrate exceptional academic performance, drive, ambition, leadership potential and an appetite for problem solving.
