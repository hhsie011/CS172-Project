All student mail (including letters, periodicals, and packages) should be addressed as follows: Student Name XXXX Altschul 3009 Broadway New York, NY 10027-6906 Note: XXXX represents your 4-digit mailbox number New Students: If your mailbox number & combination is not visible at the Slate for Students link above, it has not yet been uploaded by Mail Services.

(The Res Life does not have access to students' mailbox number or combination) When will the Student Mail Room start accepting my mail or packages? The Student Mail Room will accept mail & packages for students up to 3 days before their scheduled move-in date. If you're sending packages before moving in, please ask the shipper to hold delivery until that time. Can I receive mail & packages during the summer? If you are a continuing student who will be living on campus (or in the city) over the summer, please contact Mail Services (mailservices@barnard.edu) to request to keep your mailbox open to receive mail/packages over the summer. Can I address my mail or packages to my residence hall room? No. Mail and/or packages addressed to residence hall rooms will not be accepted (see exception below for packages only at Cathedral Gardens). Packages at Cathedral Gardens Residents of Cathedral Gardens only may receive packages at their building (but not regular mail, which should be addressed to their Altschul Mail Box).
