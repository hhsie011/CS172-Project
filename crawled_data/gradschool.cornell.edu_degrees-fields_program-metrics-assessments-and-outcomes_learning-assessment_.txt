Faculty assess student performance through a variety of direct and indirect measures, including: Semesters of registration Student progress reviews Official milestones and special exams, such as qualifying exams (Q exams), administered early in an academic program; admission to candidacy exams (A exams), which assess breadth and depth in the discipline; and the defense of the thesis or dissertation (B exams) Public presentations of scholarly work The Graduate School leadership works closely with field faculty in establishing and articulating goals, objectives, and rubrics through which the aims of graduate education can be met. Graduate education learning outcomes are communicated to students on websites, in annual student orientations, and by the special committee. Monitoring time-to-degree and supporting faculty mentoring and student teaching are additional ways in which the Graduate School establishes and uphold standards. Learning Proficiencies for all Graduate Students Graduate education at Cornell is diverse, cross-disciplinary, and dynamic.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
