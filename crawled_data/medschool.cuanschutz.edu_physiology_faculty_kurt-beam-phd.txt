We use a variety of techniques including molecular biology, electrophysiology, biochemistry, and analysis of structure. A major focus has been on the protein complex in skeletal muscle that links conformational changes of a plasma-membrane calcium channel (CaV1.1) to activation of Ca2+ release via RyR1 in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 1). As one approach for studying this process, we express cDNAs encoding key proteins in cultured muscle cells (myotubes). This animation illustrates GFP-CaV1.1 in myotubes null for endogenous CaV1.1: each green dot corresponds to ~100 calcium channels clustered in the plasma membrane. More recently (Ref. 4), we were able to identify a set of five proteins sufficient to reproduce the Ca2+ release process in skeletal muscle (Fig. 2) and are now using this system to identify the underlying molecular interactions. Isoforms of all five of these proteins are expressed in the nervous system, where much less is known about their biological roles. Our recent work has begun to examine how these proteins function in neurons (Fig. 3, Refs. 6-8).
