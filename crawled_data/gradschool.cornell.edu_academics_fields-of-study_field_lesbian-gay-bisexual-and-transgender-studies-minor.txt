It is primarily concerned with the representations and lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender subjects, even as these subjects remain stubbornly and productively difficult to define once and for all. LGBT Studies is an interdisciplinary program, and it is likewise open to a variety of perspectives on the stability of its constituent identity categories. Indeed, central to the curriculum is a sense that sexuality varies across time and place, serves political ends, and cannot be thought in isolation from gender, class, race, ethnicity, age, religion, and physical ability. LGBT Studies emphasizes both the diachronic differences in the constitution of sexualities (how sexuality is different in different historical periods) as well as the synchronic ones (how sexuality takes shape within particular texts, periods, or populations). This is a minor field. Application for admission is made only to the major fields. After matriculation, a student may select minor subjects from the major or minor fields.

The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of GayogoÌ±hÃ³êž‰nÇ«' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of GayogoÌ±hÃ³êž‰nÇ«' people, past and present, to these lands and waters.
