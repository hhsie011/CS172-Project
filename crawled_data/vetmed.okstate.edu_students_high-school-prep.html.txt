Here are some things you can do now. Gain Experience Preparation for a career in veterinary medicine includes understanding the profession. Volunteering, shadowing or working with a veterinarian is essential. Students should develop emotional maturity and become aware of how medical decisions include patient, client and financial issues. Professionalism and ethics are fundamental for veterinarians. Take the Right Classes Although the vet school does not use your high school grades to determine eligibility, students in high school are strongly encouraged to take coursework heavy in these sciences if offered at the school: Anatomy Biology Chemistry Genetics Microbiology Physics Learn all you can about Veterinary Careers Veterinarians can work in many different fields. Some fields include private practice, teaching at universities or colleges, research, work in large companies who produce medicines and pet food, and work in the military.
