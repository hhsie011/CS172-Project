FSP Paris Terms FSP in Paris is offered during the Winter and Spring Terms. About the FSP in Paris The FSP in Paris provides an advanced program of study designed to expand the curriculum of Dartmouth College into new areas of significant intellectual discovery and cultural understanding through supervised study and residence. NOTE: As of Winter 2020, students who complete the FSP will have all three courses count toward the major or minor in French. This applies retroactively to students who completed the FSP in 2019. Students live with local families and take three Dartmouth courses taught exclusively in French: French 29: French Civilization. This course has two parts and meets three times a week. One weekly class meeting is devoted to history (with Professor Blanc), and the other to art history (with Professor Léglise-Costa.) The history component focuses on 19th and 20th century French history using narratives drawn from a variety of disciplines, namely literature, sociology, and history. The art history component includes both classroom study and site visits, such as excursions to monuments and museums. French 30: French Literature. Taught by the Dartmouth Professor who directs the program. In this course, students read representative works of French literature depending upon the choice and specialization of the director. The class may also attend plays and films in the city, or go on local excursions that are relevant to the course material, which often focuses on representations and discussions of Paris in a wide range of texts, documents, photographs, paintings, and films. French 31: French Language and Civilization. Taught by Professor Mathilde Sitbon, this course is designed to improve students' spoken and written French. The review of the more complex grammatical points is combined with exposure to aspects of contemporary French society and life in France, such as the educational system, new trends in French society, every-day life in Paris, and cultural differences between France and the US. Classes will sometimes be held in the city. In addition to their coursework, students explore the city and the region through short excursions to museums, architectural sites and participation in cultural events.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of French and Italian Undergraduate Overview Placement Information & Exams Transfer Credit Areas of Study & Course Descriptions French Language Courses French Upper Level Courses French and Italian in Translation Italian Language Courses Italian Upper Level Courses Course Schedules 2023-2024 French Courses 2022-2023 French Courses 2021-2022 French Courses 2022-2023 Italian Courses 2021-2022 Italian Courses Majors French Italian Romance Languages French Studies Italian Studies French or Italian as a Modifier Minors Honors Thesis Program The Thesis French Timeline Italian Timeline Endowed Research Grant Study Abroad Overview French LSA/LSA+ Toulouse FSP Paris Italian Full Immersion Rome Experience (FIRE) Italian LSA/LSA+ Rome Opportunities Overview Apprentice Teacher Info Co-Curricular Opportunities Affinity Housing/Global Village French Language Program Italian Language Program Job Opportunities Director's Assistant Positions in Rome Student Awards and Prizes Arianna Pagani ’93 Memorial Prize In French And Italian Bruno Tollon Prize In French Studies Cloise Appleton Crane Prize In French And Italian François Denoeu Memorial Prize French Consulate Prize George E.
