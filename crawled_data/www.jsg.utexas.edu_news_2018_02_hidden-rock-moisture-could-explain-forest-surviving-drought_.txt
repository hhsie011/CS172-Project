Hidden “Rock Moisture” Could Explain Forest Surviving Drought February 26, 2018 Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Research led by The University of Texas at Austin has found that weathered bedrock can store a significant amount of rock moisture inside its fractures and pores. This moisture in the layer of weathered rock that is commonly located beneath soils is an important part of the water cycle on the local and global level. Tree roots tap into the rock moisture and release it back into the atmosphere as water vapor, and water flows through the fractures and becomes part of the seasonal groundwater storage (blue arrows). Research conducted by The University of Texas at Austin and University of California, Berkeley has found that a little-studied, underground layer of rock can hold significant amounts of water that may serve as a vital reservoir for trees, especially in times of drought. The study, published in the journal PNAS on February 26 looked at the water stored inside the layer of weathered bedrock that commonly lies under soils in mountainous environments. Lead author Daniella Rempe, an assistant professor at the Jackson School of Geosciences, with a drill used to create boreholes. This transitional zone beneath soils and above groundwater is often overlooked when it comes to studying hydrological processes, but researchers found that the water contained within the fractures and pores of the rock could play an important role in the water cycle at the local and global level. “There are significant hydrologic dynamics in weathered bedrock environments, but they are not traditionally investigated because they are hard to access,” said lead author Daniella Rempe, an assistant professor in the Department of Geological Sciences at the UT Austin Jackson School of Geosciences. “The study was designed to investigate this region directly.” Researchers found the water within the bedrock has the ability to sustain trees through droughts even after the soil has become parched. At the field site in Northern California’s Mendocino County, scientists found that up to 27 percent of annual rainfall was stored as “rock moisture,” the water clinging to cracks and pores within the bedrock. The impact of rock moisture will vary depending on the region and topography, but researchers said it likely explains how the trees in the study area showed little affect from the severe 2010-2015 drought that killed more than 100 million trees throughout California. “How trees can survive extended periods of severe drought has been a mystery,” said Richard Yuretich, director of the National Science Foundation’s Critical Zone Observatories program, which funded the research. “This study has revealed a significant reservoir of trapped water that has gone unnoticed in the past. Research of this kind can help greatly in managing natural resources during times of environmental stress.” Taking moisture measurements with a neutron probe. Drilling a borehole at the research site. To conduct the study, researchers monitored the rock moisture from 2013-2016 at nine wells drilled into the weathered bedrock along a steep forested hillslope. They used a neutron probe, a precision tool that measures the amount of water in a sample area by detecting hydrogen. They found that the weathered rock layer built up a supply of 4 to 21 inches of rock moisture during the winter wet season, depending on the well. The maximum amount of rock moisture in each well stayed about the same throughout the study period, which included a significant drought year. It’s a major finding that indicates that it doesn’t matter if it rains a little or a lot during the winter dry season—the total rainfall amount does not influence the rock moisture levels. “It doesn’t matter how much it rains in the winter, rock moisture builds up to the same maximum value,” Rempe said. “That leads to the same amount of water every summer that’s available for use by trees.” Researchers also found that the average rock moisture at all wells exceeded the average soil moisture measurements at all locations. Researchers on a hill slope at the research site. “Soils are important, but when it comes to determining if a place is going to experience water stress, it could be the underlying rock that matters most,” Rempe said. “This is the first time this has been demonstrated in a multi-year field study.” The potential for rock moisture to travel back to the atmosphere via evaporation from tree leaves or to trickle down into groundwater indicates that it could have a broad impact on the environment and climate. Zong-Liang Yang, a professor in the Jackson School’s Department of Geological Sciences who was not involved in the study, said that the research highlights the need to gather data so rock moisture can be incorporated into climate models. “At present, most, if not all, of global climate and hydrological models neglect moisture stored in rocks,” Yang said. “This study fills a critical gap in our understanding.” The study provides a glimpse into rock moisture at a small, intensive research site, said co-author William Dietrich, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. He said the data collected during this study should be a starting point for more research in more places. “The future paths are many,” Dietrich said. “We have just one site well-studied… A mixture of theory and field studies will need to be developed to provide regional information for climate modelers.” The research was supported by the Keck Foundation, the National Science Foundation, and The University of California Reserve System.\ For more information, contact: Anton Caputo, Jackson School of Geosciences, 512-232-9623; Monica Kortsha, Jackson School of Geosciences, 512-471-2241 Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Tags: Daniella Rempe, Hydrogeology, hydrology, Surface Hydrologic Processes News Media Releases Dean’s Office Blogs In the News Scientist Profiles Newsletter Texas Geosciences Advancing Excellence Media Contacts Media Releases Select Month May 2022 (6) April 2022 (3) March 2022 (5) February 2022 (7) January 2022 (4) December 2021 (6) November 2021 (2) October 2021 (2) September 2021 (7) August 2021 (3) July 2021 (3) June 2021 (5) May 2021 (4) April 2021 (3) March 2021 (10) February 2021 (2) January 2021 (7) December 2020 (3) November 2020 (2) October 2020 (4) August 2020 (7) July 2020 (6) June 2020 (4) May 2020 (5) March 2020 (4) February 2020 (4) January 2020 (2) December 2019 (4) November 2019 (4) October 2019 (4) September 2019 (4) August 2019 (1) July 2019 (3) June 2019 (2) May 2019 (4) April 2019 (2) February 2019 (3) January 2019 (4) December 2018 (2) November 2018 (6) October 2018 (2) September 2018 (2) August 2018 (1) July 2018 (1) June 2018 (3) May 2018 (3) April 2018 (4) March 2018 (2) February 2018 (1) January 2018 (3) December 2017 (7) November 2017 (6) October 2017 (2) September 2017 (3) August 2017 (2) July 2017 (4) June 2017 (1) May 2017 (3) April 2017 (2) March 2017 (2) February 2017 (3) January 2017 (2) December 2016 (2) November 2016 (5) October 2016 (2) September 2016 (1) August 2016 (2) July 2016 (4) June 2016 (4) May 2016 (5) April 2016 (4) March 2016 (3) February 2016 (6) January 2016 (1) December 2015 (3) November 2015 (5) October 2015 (3) September 2015 (2) August 2015 (1) July 2015 (1) June 2015 (6) May 2015 (5) April 2015 (5) March 2015 (5) February 2015 (6) January 2015 (3) November 2014 (3) October 2014 (4) September 2014 (2) August 2014 (1) July 2014 (1) June 2014 (1) May 2014 (1) April 2014 (1) February 2014 (2) January 2014 (3) December 2013 (4) November 2013 (5) October 2013 (5) September 2013 (5) August 2013 (3) July 2013 (4) June 2013 (2) May 2013 (1) April 2013 (5) March 2013 (2) February 2013 (4) January 2013 (4) December 2012 (1) November 2012 (4) October 2012 (2) September 2012 (3) August 2012 (2) July 2012 (3) June 2012 (1) May 2012 (6) April 2012 (3) March 2012 (3) February 2012 (5) January 2012 (5) December 2011 (1) November 2011 (5) October 2011 (1) September 2011 (3) August 2011 (2) July 2011 (1) June 2011 (4) May 2011 (4) April 2011 (5) March 2011 (13) February 2011 (1) January 2011 (3) December 2010 (4) November 2010 (5) October 2010 (6) September 2010 (1) August 2010 (2) July 2010 (4) June 2010 (1) May 2010 (6) April 2010 (4) March 2010 (4) February 2010 (3) January 2010 (1) December 2009 (2) November 2009 (3) October 2009 (3) September 2009 (3) August 2009 (8) June 2009 (4) May 2009 (3) April 2009 (4) March 2009 (1) February 2009 (3) January 2009 (3) December 2008 (3) November 2008 (3) October 2008 (10) September 2008 (2) August 2008 (2) July 2008 (7) May 2008 (8) April 2008 (5) March 2008 (2) February 2008 (6) January 2008 (8) December 2007 (2) November 2007 (4) October 2007 (1) September 2007 (8) May 2007 (2) January 2007 (1) December 2006 (4) October 2006 (1) January 2006 (1) August 2005 (1) September 2003 (1) Twitter Tweets by txgeosciences Older Post Newer Post Mailing Address Jackson School of Geosciences 2305 Speedway Stop C1160 Austin, TX 78712-1692 Phone (512) 471-6048 Support JSG Departments & Units Department of Geological Sciences Bureau of Economic Geology Institute for Geophysics Administration & Offices College Leadership Career Services Business Services Development and Alumni Relations Office of Communications Information Technology Office Helpful Links UT Austin UT Direct Emergency Information IT Help JSG Directory JSG Profiles Contact Us Facebook Twitter YouTube RSS News Feed © 2022 Jackson School of Geosciences, The University of Texas at Austin Web Privacy | Web Accessibility Policy | Adobe Reader
