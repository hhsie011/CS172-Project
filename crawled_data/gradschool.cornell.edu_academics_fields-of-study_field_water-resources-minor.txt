The student chooses one of the field's faculty members to serve as a minor member of the Special Committee and to design a program of study consistent with the student's needs. Because the program in interdisciplinary, this faculty member cannot be a faculty member in the student's major field. Two courses (minimum of 6 credits) are required for M.S. students. Four courses (minimum of 12 credits) are required for Ph.D. students. For joint M.S./Ph.D. degree programs, the two M.S. courses may be applied toward the Ph.D. requirement. Although course selection is the prerogative of the student and Water Resources committee member, in general the courses should relate to some aspect of water resources and provide the student with an interdisciplinary experience. Courses may not be selected from the student's major field, nor may they simultaneously satisfy major and minor requirements. Additional information may be obtained from the field's faculty members. This is a minor field. Application for admission is made only to the major fields. After matriculation, a student may select minor subjects from the major or minor fields.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
