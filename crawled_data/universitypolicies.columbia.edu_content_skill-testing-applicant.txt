Faculty should consult the Faculty Handbook or contact the Office of the Senior Vice Provost for Academic Administration. Officers of the Libraries should consult the Libraries Director of Human Resources regarding policy interpretation and application. Employees in collective bargaining units should consult the relevant provisions of their collective bargaining agreements or contact the Office of Labor Relations. To ensure that the use of employment tests does not adversely affect the employment of any candidate, and does not violate the Equal Employment Opportunity laws, Senior Human Resources Business Partners and the Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action must approve all pre-employment tests used as criteria for employee selection. Senior Human Resources Business Partners will evaluate the test to ascertain whether it is predictive of or significantly correlated with important elements of the job requisition description. Employment tests are considered valid only if they directly evaluate the same skills the applicant is expected to use in the performance of stated duties. A hiring department and/or School may conduct an approved employment test only in those areas where similar tests are not administered by the Senior Human Resources Business Partners. If an employment test for a particular job opening has been disapproved, the hiring department, or School may not give the test to any applicant. Hiring departments will attach to the job requisition any proposal for job testing with an explanation of the relationship of the skills tested and the skills required for job performance.
