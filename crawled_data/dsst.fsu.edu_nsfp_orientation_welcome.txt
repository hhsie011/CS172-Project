Orientation is designed to help students transition to college and assist family members in understanding their students’ experience during this exciting time. Entering an academic community is an important, and sometimes stressful, time in a person’s life – let us help you along the way. New Student & Family Programs is excited to share this experience with you and can’t wait to introduce you to the Florida State University community. This website contains information about our programs, dates, and registration procedures for upcoming sessions, an introduction to the Orientation Leaders, and other helpful resources to prepare you for your FSU experience. New Nole Orientation Modality New Nole Orientation registration will open on March 7, 2022. Transfer Orientations in March and early May will continue to be held virtually as we hope to limit the spread of COVID-19. All orientation sessions beginning May 15, 2022 will resume in person.
