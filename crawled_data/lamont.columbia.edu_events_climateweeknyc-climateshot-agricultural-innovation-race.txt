Share Add to Calendar: Calendar / Outlook Google Yahoo September 20, 2021 9:00 AM - 10:15 AM America/New_York Online ClimateShot: The agricultural innovation race to save our planet Find out how to connect research & innovation with the global partnerships that transform food systems for a climate-smart future! 15:00-16:15 CET This is a make-or-break year to secure meaningful commitments in addressing the climate crisis and putting our food systems on a sustainable path before it's too late...and we need YOU to transform our food systems and save our planet. A key part of such a transformation will be a step change in agricultural innovation to support ambitious action. But how can stakeholders across the food system join forces to ensure agricultural innovation contributes to climate mitigation, adaptation and resilience? Join us to debate the emerging ‘Action Agenda for Innovation’ that's going to be launched at the UN COP26 climate summit in Glasgow this November.
