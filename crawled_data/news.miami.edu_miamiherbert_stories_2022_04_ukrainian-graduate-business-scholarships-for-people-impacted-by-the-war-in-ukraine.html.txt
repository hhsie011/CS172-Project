In an effort to support those impacted by the war in Ukraine, the University of Miami Patti and Allan Herbert Business School will provide two full-tuition graduate scholarships—one for the full-time MBA program and one for a Specialized Master’s program—beginning as early as August 2022 to qualified graduate students. “The lives of many students with the potential to contribute innovative ideas and knowledge to the global business community have been disrupted,” said John Quelch, dean of Miami Herbert. “And as an international business school with a sense of global responsibility, we welcome the opportunity to offer tangible help to two qualified graduate students displaced by the recent events in Ukraine.” With the establishment of these scholarships, the donors hope to profoundly change the personal and professional trajectory of highly deserving international students. "Miami Herbert’s effort to help international students affected by the war in Ukraine means a lot to me,” says Margarita Sinko, a senior of Ukrainian descent at Miami Herbert. “Education has always been the key to a better life, and it is amazing that Miami Herbert and donors want to help students with their education, especially with what they have gone through." The scholarships are open to qualified graduate students, including those recently displaced by the war in Ukraine. To be considered for these scholarships, applicants must qualify for admission to Miami Herbert’s Full-time MBA Program or one of its Specialized Master’s Programs commencing August 2022.
