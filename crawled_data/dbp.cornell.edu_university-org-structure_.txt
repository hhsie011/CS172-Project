Organizational Charts represent how the university organizes its functions and organizational structures defined within systems, driving security, business processes, and reporting, represent the “lenses” used to view the university from different perspectives. There are three Primary Organizational Structures used to view the institution: Financial, Human Resources, and Academic. Organizational Charts The Division of Budget and Planning maintains organizational charts for the President, the Provosts, the Executive Vice President and the majority of their direct reports. They are updated as needed, but at least annually as of July 1st. Update requests should be sent to Univ-Org-Chart@cornell.edu.
