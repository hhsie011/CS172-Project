English majors learn to see complex problems in their full richness and don’t take the first answer, or the simplest answer, as truth. In our courses, all kinds of texts – from medieval poems to postmodern novels, adapted screenplays to literary criticism – appear as windows into the cultures and conditions in which they were produced. English majors develop habits of mind attuned to the reasons why people do what they do and write what they write. Our graduates are engaged, empathetic people pursuing a creative, critical, and useful degree. The English major includes an array of subjects ranging in literary history to film and visual culture, creative and nonfiction writing, rhetoric and literacy, and the digital humanities. We focus on the big picture and the details: close reading skills and critical analysis, how literacy and language change over time, and how social and historical movements and processes are represented in texts. Reading, writing, active listening, discussing, presenting, and debating are foundational activities in our classrooms. When entering the program, students are encouraged to explore their current literary interests and find new ones by selecting from a wide range of lower-division courses. At the 300-level, English majors take a series of specialized courses in which they practice essential skills for advanced study; they also prepare for future careers in a course specifically designed to help them recognize and promote their skills. At the 400-level, students explore specific literary periods and movements in greater depth and put their English major skills to use in a hands-on, classroom-based collaborative project and/or individual thesis. Major Code: 890 Write effective arguments about a variety of literary and cultural texts. Use information literacy and new technologies to plan and conduct research appropriate to initial and advanced study in English. Recognize and interpret a wide variety of texts and genres (may include visual, material, inter-cultural texts), using a range of theoretical and interpretive strategies, including close reading. Demonstrate the role of context(s) in production, reception, and transmission of literary and cultural texts (across periods, histories, geographical/national spaces, and cultural differences). Undergraduate English majors must attain proficiency in a foreign language, as certified by the School of Language, Culture, and Society, equivalent to that assumed at the end of a second-year language sequence (211/212/213). A grade of C– or better is required for all courses used to complete major requirements. Courses taken to satisfy major requirements may not be taken with an S/U grade. Total credits required for graduation is 180.
