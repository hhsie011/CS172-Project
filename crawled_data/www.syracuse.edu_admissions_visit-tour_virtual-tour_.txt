The best way to discover everything we have to offer is an in-person visit—but we know that not everyone can make it to campus. The Syracuse University Virtual Tour was designed with this in mind. You’ll be led through the tour by alumni, and you can craft your own experience, choosing which areas of the campus you’d like to learn more about. The tour offers 360° views and videos, so that you can get a better feel of our historic buildings and modern facilities.
