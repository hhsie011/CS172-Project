Why a BSEd at Baylor? APPLY to BAYLOR Hands-on Learning With up to 6 semesters of field work, beginning the freshman year, you will find out early if teaching is your passion. If so, you can begin to pursue that passion immediately and have an instant impact on children. Faculty Interaction The highly engaged SOE faculty members are committed to teaching research-based instruction and classroom management. The low student-faculty ratio (less than 15-1) means you can develop meaningful mentor relationship with faculty that will enrich your career for years to come. Career Readiness Baylor teacher candidates have achieved a 100% pass rate on the Texas certification exam for 2014-16. A full-time internship your senior year in the K-12 classroom will prepare you with exposure to the full academic year, professional networking and experience with the co-teach model. Research Opportunities All School of Education seniors conduct Action Research in the K-12 classroom as a way to train for future observation and improvement of their own teaching practice. The Baylor Life Baylor offers a high-research university with a faith-based tradition, a caring Christian community of scholars, plus world-class facilities, extracurricular activities galore and Big 12 athletics.
