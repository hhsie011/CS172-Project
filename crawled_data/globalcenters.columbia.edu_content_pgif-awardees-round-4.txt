Coatsworth has announced the fourth round of grants from the President’s Global Innovation Fund. The purpose of the Fund is to support faculty who are developing projects that increase opportunities for research, teaching, and service around the world. The 12 projects receiving awards were selected by a review committee of senior faculty drawn from both the Morningside and medical campuses. Many of the projects are led by a team of faculty members, and others are the work of a single Columbia scholar. All make use of our network of eight Columbia Global Centers on four continents, and will provide opportunities for faculty and students to address vital global issues. This year’s selected projects cover a vast range of disciplines and topics, from volcanoes to trade relations. The full list of funded projects can be found below. These awards follow three prior rounds of grants from the President’s Global Innovation Fund that have supported 49 equally diverse projects. Collectively, these and future projects will play an essential role in realizing the potential of the Columbia Global Centers to create new opportunities for faculty and students, and in defining in tangible ways what it means for Columbia to explore new frontiers of knowledge in the 21st century.
