Speakers: Benjamin Conisbee Baer, Princeton University Eduardo Cadava, Princeton University Mireille Calle-Gruber, Sorbonne Nouvelle-Paris 3 Avital Ronell, New York University Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Columbia University Moderated by Souleymane Bachir Diagne, Columbia University. Featuring a performance by pianist and Columbia scholar Yohann Ripert. In 1967, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak translated Jacques Derrida’s revolutionary text, Of Grammatology, from French, thereby introducing the English-speaking world to the philosopher and his complex notion of deconstructionism. Forty years after Of Grammatology first appeared in English, Spivak retranslates this seminal work with greater awareness of Derrida’s legacy, as well as updated references. The anniversary edition also includes a new afterword by Spivak and an introduction by Judith Butler. The event will be followed by a book signing with Professor Spivak.
