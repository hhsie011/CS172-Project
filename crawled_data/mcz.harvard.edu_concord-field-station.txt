The CFS is affiliated with the Museum of Comparative Zoology and the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology. The CFS supports physiological and biomechanical laboratory-based research of animal performance, seeking to understand how animals operate in their natural environment. Field-based physiological ecology studies are supported by an adjoining 65 acres of pasture and wooded vegetation and 650 acres of Harvard-owned land in the Town of Concord's Estabrook Woods. The Concord Field Station provides space and research support for MCZ Faculty-Curator, Andrew Biewener, together with affiliate faculty and research associates, whose work also makes use of its facilities. Research and teaching projects are also more broadly linked to Organismic and Evolutionary Biology faculty and students (these have recently included projects on native fungi, community ecology and global climate change). website Biewener Lab people Questions?
