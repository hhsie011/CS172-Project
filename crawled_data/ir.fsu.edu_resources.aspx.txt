Files are needed to meet statutory requirements and/or to support information needs. In addition to standard computer file submissions, universities are asked to provide information/data in other media, such as hard copies of reports. Each of the twelve institutions has an "Institution Data Administrator" to coordinate the flow of information from and to the SUS Data Administrator, regardless of which university department or office is responsible for generating the information. This data administrator system facilitates the coordination of information between the universities and the Chancellor's Office. The SUS Data Administrator is responsible, in conjunction with the universities, for designing and maintaining the computer programs and definitions, for the data contained in the computer files to be submitted. The SUS data administrator maintains a schedule of data/information due dates. A list of data/information requests and due dates is made available on a regular basis by the SUS Data Administrator. The list is available via the Internet through the BOG website.
