PreviousNext Art History Professor Mary Coffey, interim LALACS chair, is one of fourteen members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences recognized for exceptional achievement in scholarship, teaching, and mentoring for 2020. The awards, announced annually by the Office of the Dean of Faculty of Arts and Sciences, include the Jerome Goldstein Award for Distinguished Teaching, which is given based on feedback from students. The other awardees were selected by the associate deans of the four arts and sciences divisions. "These scholar-teachers represent the liberal arts ideal that is at the core of a Dartmouth education," says Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Elizabeth Smith. "Their commitment to teaching and their passion for scholarship makes their work in the classroom, laboratory, and studio the launching point for their students' lifelong learning and leadership." Professor Coffey states, "I am an art historian whose research focus is Mexican muralism. At Dartmouth, I am the resident expert on Jose Clemente Orozco's mural, The Epic of American Civilization. Like Orozco, I explore the historical construction of U.S. America through its entanglements with Latin America. In that respect, I seek to understand how U.S.-based, ethnocentric narratives of "American" history contribute to the exclusion of Latino/a/x histories and experiences from our national imaginary." "In the classroom, I teach courses on U.S. American and Latin American art, and my goal is always to raise questions rather than to foreclose them with simplistic narratives. Over my career at Dartmouth, I have developed an experience-based pedagogy that involves students in the creation of knowledge. Their projects and perspectives have, in turn, reshaped my teaching and research. I believe that unlearning is a part of all learning and that my students teach me as much as I teach them.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Art History Undergraduate Major, Minor and Modifications Overview Honors Courses Distribution of Subject Areas Foreign Study Careers & Opportunities Careers in Art History College-level teaching Museum Work Publishing and Freelance Writing Art Librarian and Visual Resource Librarian Secondary Education Art and Architectural Preservation and Conservation Art Galleries / Auction Houses Corporate Art Curator and Art Investment Art Law Governmental Agencies Internships in Museums, Galleries, & Auction Houses Museum, Gallery Internships & Select Fieldwork in the United States Internships and Field Experience outside the United States Fellowships and Opportunities External Fellowships Internal (Dartmouth-Based) Fellowships Graduate Study How to choose where to apply?
