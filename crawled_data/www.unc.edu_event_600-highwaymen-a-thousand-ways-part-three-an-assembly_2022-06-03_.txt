UNC Student discount not allowed for this event. Buy tickets on the Carolina Performing Arts website. Obie Award-winning theatermakers, 600 HIGHWAYMEN, known for exhilarating performances that challenge the very definition of theater, have created a quietly radical response to this new world with A Thousand Ways. Taking place over several months, each distinct installment presents a new chance at making contact with a stranger. It is a chance at being heard, a brave moment to show up. This is an invitation. Will you attend? The third and final installment of the triptych is a revival of collective assembly. A performance enacted entirely by the attending audience, this is an invitation to feel what it’s like to experience common space again, and how to come together in a new way. How to Participate Tickets are required for Part Three: An Assembly. All phases of this project are ticketed separately. You do not need to have attended Parts One and Two to attend Part Three. Just like Parts One and Two, you will be creating a theatrical experience with the other audience members in attendance at CURRENT ArtSpace + Studio. Using a stack of instructive notecards, you will collectively recount a timeless story of perseverance — of audacity in the face of uncertainty. This elucidating experience invites participants to consider one another — individually and collectively — and the significance of coming together after so much time apart. Run time is 60 minutes. Age restriction is 16 years and older. Due to the intimate nature of this performance, late seating is not available. Masks required at all times while inside CPA venues during the 21/22 season. For additional health and safety information and more, visit our FAQ page. About 600 HIGHWAYMEN 600 HIGHWAYMEN (Abigail Browde and Michael Silverstone), “standard bearers of contemporary theater-making” (Le Monde) who have “quietly been shaking up American theatre since 2009” (The Guardian), have been making live art that, through a variety of radical approaches, illuminates the inherent poignancy of people coming together. Their productions exist at the intersection of theater, dance, contemporary performance, and civic encounter. Their production The Fever was part of the inaugural season of CPA’s CURRENT ArtSpace + Studio in spring 2017. 600 HIGHWAYMEN’s work has been seen at Centre Pompidou (Paris), The Public Theater (NYC), La Jolla Playhouse (La Jolla), Walker Art Center (Minneapolis), Museum of Contemporary Art (Chicago), Kimmel Center (Philadelphia), Dublin Theatre Festival (Dublin), Onassis Cultural Centre (Greece), Bristol Old Vic (UK), Salzburg Festival (Salzburg), and Theaterspektakel (Switzerland). 600 HIGHWAYMEN are recipients of Switzerland’s ZKB Patronize Prize, and their work has been nominated for two Bessie Awards, a Drama League Award, and Austria’s Nestroy Prize. In 2016, Abigail and Michael were named artist fellows by the New York Foundation for the Arts. They are currently Associate Artists of IN SITU, the European platform for artistic creation in public space.
