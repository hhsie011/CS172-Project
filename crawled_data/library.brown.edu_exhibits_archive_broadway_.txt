A trip to New York to see the shows is always a treat, and the season's hits that tour the country have been for many years eagerly anticipated events. This exhibition, drawn from the holdings of the John Hay Library, is a small taste of the thousands of musical plays that have appeared on the New York stage in the last century and a half. Drawn from the Harris Collection of American Poetry and Plays, the Sheet Music Collection, the Manuscripts Collections, the Starred Book Collection, and the Robert J. Tierney Collection of Entertainment Memorabilia, it includes examples of scores, librettos, sheet music, souvenir albums and playbills. enter the exhibit broadway musical home | exhibits home | library home | about this exhibit Last modified: Tuesday, 03-Mar-2015 13:58:17 EST For more information, contact: hay@brown.edu Â© 2005, Brown University Library.
