This minor is nontechnical in nature and is specifically designed for students seeking the Bachelor of Arts degree. Its focus is on the interaction of humans and the natural environment and the consequences of that interaction. The environmental studies minor does not seek to train professional environmentalists, but in combination with existing major programs it will give the student a broad foundation for more advanced environmental studies programs, professional work in law, regional planning or resource management, various environmental positions in government, business, or teaching. The plan will also provide students with a better understanding of basic ecology and the nature of environmental problems so that they can make more knowledgeable value judgments on environmental issues, a vital concern in the contemporary world.
