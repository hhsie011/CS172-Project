Some of the skills and qualities you’ll learn as you cultivate an entrepreneurial mindset include idea generation, design and prototyping, problem-solving, pitching your ideas, teamwork and collaboration, resilience, flexibility, and a tolerance for risk. Through an exciting interdisciplinary program that combines courses from Business, Communication, Engineering, Fine Arts, and Liberal Arts, among others, you will earn a certificate that is tailored to your specific interests and career goals, while gaining hands-on research or internship experience that allows you to put your entrepreneurial skills and ideas into practice. For a complete list of courses and requirements, download the Innovation, Creativity & Entrepreneurship BDP curriculum sheet (PDF). Requirements With 19 credit hours of coursework and Connecting Experiences, students may earn a BDP certificate in Innovation, Creativity & Entrepreneurship. Courses counting toward a BDP in Innovation, Creativity & Entrepreneurship may also satisfy core, major, and elective requirements in a student’s degree plan. With planning, the BDP should not add time to students’ UT careers, but instead helps students choose the courses they already have to take in an integrated way. Foundation Courses [7 hours] Forum Seminar Entrepreneurship Course Foundations Course Courses in a Strand [9 hours] In designing the strand, each student must choose one strand course that focuses on Creativity in the student’s discipline or area of focus. The remaining two courses will focus more broadly on Innovation and Entrepreneurship across disciplines. Only one strand course may be taken from the student’s major department; at least one strand course must come from outside the student’s college or school. Connecting Experiences [3 hours] BDP advisors assist students in finding meaningful connecting research and/or internship experiences related to Innovation, Creativity & Entrepreneurship. For examples of Connecting Experiences Innovation, Creativity & Entrepreneurship students have completed in the past, read these Connecting Experience spotlights.
