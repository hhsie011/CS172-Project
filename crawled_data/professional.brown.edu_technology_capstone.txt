Access the Application Request Information Upcoming Information Sessions Capstone: Critical Challenge Project The Critical Challenge Project (CCP) is central to the ScM in Technology Leadership learning experience and will become the focus of your independent study. You will identify a critical challenge related to your field and interests, drawing from your own experience and vision for the future. Under the direction of a faculty member, students analyze their critical challenge from multiple perspectives and develop a comprehensive plan for addressing it. You'll address real-time challenges and apply the knowledge and skills you learn throughout the program — with particular emphasis on integrating technology, policy, and human factor aspects. Your CCP should consider ethical implications and have practical applicability to the field of technology — taking into account multiple stakeholders, such as customers, developers, policymakers, and government and industry executives as you develop innovative, transformative and viable solutions. The CCP often delivers high-impact results. Some examples of project deliverables and outcomes include: New product(s) deployed Patent applications Tech innovation with potential for market disruption Prototype or proof of concept completed during program Management decision-making tool or process enhancement Delivering Impact $ 378M In Value Created 83 Apps & Products Created $ 61M Company Investments into CCP Concepts 9 New Pilots & Processes Launched and Funded Upon completion of the Critical Challenge Project, students should be able to: Tackle a technology problem facing their industry Position yourself for leadership in their industry Build a network of advisors for their long term career aspirations Recent Capstone Projects Sample Project Titles: Decision Analysis (DA) for Optimizing Value of Complex Systems Expanding Markets and Improving Software Security Through Openness Centralize Design and IP Release System for Company X Custom Foundry Designing a Personalized Integrated Digital Health Platform to Increase Better Health Care Outcomes for Employees Digital Online Underwriting Guide Artificial Intelligence & Prescriptive Maintenance - Beyond Predictive to AI Network Governance https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPsSgZp-stE The Critical Challenge Project Classroom excellence, real-word application Learn More Request Information Upcoming Events Diversity & Inclusion Apply Today Access the Application Brown University Providence RI 02912 401-863-7901 Quick Navigation Visit Brown Campus Map A to Z Contact Us Footer Navigation Privacy Policy Campus Safety Accessibility Careers at Brown The campaign for building on distinction Give To Brown © Brown University School of Professional Studies Brown University For You Admitted Students Search Menu Mobile Site Navigation Mobile Site Navigation Degree Programs Healthcare Leadership IE Brown Executive MBA Technology Leadership Executive Education American Healthcare in the Post Pandemic Era Custom Programs for Organizations Leader as Coach for Healthcare | Live Online Leader as Coach | Live Online Leadership and Performance Coaching Certification Powerful and Persuasive Communication | Live Online Team Coaching Program Certificates Digital Health Innovation Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Teaching Admissions Requirements & Deadlines Funding Opportunities Admissions FAQ Alumni Ambassadors Admitted Students About The Brown Difference Our Location Our Community Our Values Contact Us Covid-19 Privacy Policy Mobile Secondary Navigation Navigation Resources For...
