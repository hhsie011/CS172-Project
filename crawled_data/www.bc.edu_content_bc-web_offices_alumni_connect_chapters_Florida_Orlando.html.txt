Lots of good times and celebrations with classmates and alumni! Why did you get involved in your local chapter?: My involvement with the BC Alumni Chapter is fueled by my fondness for what BC meant for my life. I have kept in touch with so many fellow Eagles and enjoy sharing old memories and creating new ones. Our Central Florida enjoys games watches and are trying to continue our community service outreach. What are your local favorites in your city?: My favorite local restaurant is Lee & Rick’s Oyster Bar in Orlando. Great places for a quick bite include Beefy King, which is a treasure to Orlando residents, and Longdoggers on Cocoa Beach. Lake Eola Park is a great place to spend a weekend afternoon walking or catching a concert. I-Drive and Winter Park are great places to celebrate with friends and, or course, don’t forget we have disney and Universal Studios when you need to be around crowds! Fun Fact: I currently have a daughter at the Heights who is making her own memories! Alumni Staff Liaison Name: Katie Foley Contact: foleyby@bc.edu Events ENGAGE WITH US ON EAGLE EXCHANGE!
