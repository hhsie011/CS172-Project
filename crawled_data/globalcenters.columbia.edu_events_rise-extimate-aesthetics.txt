8:00 PM Columbia Global Centers l Paris, 4 rue de Chevreuse, 75006 Tuesday March 20th – 18h–20h Reid Hall – Columbia Global Center in Paris - Grande salle “The Rise of Extimate Aesthetics” The third lecture begins with the Fanon’s Wretched of the Earth—colonized, subaltern, black and brown, the Indigenous and others who make their way through the toxic spacings of radical risk, trudging between work that doesn’t pay and dwellings that cannot be inhabited, swamps that cannot be sustained or drained—in order to reexamine the concept of the cultic in aesthetic theory and the function of art in western philosophies of truth. Acting as a concluding discussion of politics and arts in the wake of the toxic earth, “The Rise of Extimate Aesthetics,” argues that what is needed is not a new account of art, aesthetics, and artists, but an accounting of how all three contribute to the maintenance and extension of an enchanted politics of toxic sovereignty and how new form extimate aesthetics may be emerging within and against it.
