Many members of the campus community gather here amid its artistic splendor for daily and weekly Masses that are celebrated both in the main body of the church and in its basement Crypt chapel. Confessions, or the Sacrament of Reconciliation, are offered frequently, as are other sacraments' such as Matrimony, bringing back numerous alumni who wish to be married in this grand setting. The stained-glass windows were first installed in 1873, giving Notre Dame the largest collection of 19th-century French stained glass in the world. Beautiful artwork fills this space. Also helping to lift the heart to God are the voices of student choirs that sing at various Masses. Separate tours of the Basilica offer views of the art and numerous cherished artifacts from Church history.
