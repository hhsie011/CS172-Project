Tourism Management; Political Science; Psychology; Public Health Sciences; and Sociology, Anthropology and Criminal Justice. While each area is distinctive, we work together as a 21st-century land-grant college – addressing health and wellness challenges, tackling human impacts on the environment, and better understanding human, political and social behavior and the impact of an ever-connected world. These efforts in teaching, research and service further our mission of "building people and communities" in South Carolina and beyond. Learn More Give to the College “ “The influential work that our researchers do across the country and the globe is vitally important. We also focus on what is going on in our own backyard. There are underserved communities across the state and we use our research, learning and service opportunities to address critical needs throughout South Carolina, fulfill Clemson's land-grant mission, and position ourselves as a 21st-century land-grant college.” Leslie Hossfeld Dean College of Behavioral, Social and Health Sciences About Dean Hossfeld Our Schools and Departments Communication | Nursing | Parks, Recreation and Tourism Management | Political Science | Psychology | Public Health Sciences | Sociology, Anthropology and Criminal Justice Learn More >> Building Healthy Communities Building Healthy Communities is a College-wide initiative to improve community health and well-being in South Carolina, in partnership with academic and health entities across the state.

Check Out the Map >> FoodFORWARD Research Symposium If you are doing or are interested in research revolving around food systems, food safety, food packaging, food production, food anthropology, food insecurity, food communication, or anything else related to food, you are invited to come to the FoodFORWARD Research Symposium to meet other food researchers at Clemson University. Take this opportunity to network with like-minded researchers from across campus. Share your ideas. Generate new ideas. And come together for great research around the subject of food! Event Details Food Access Map The College of Behavioral, Social and Health Sciences created a Food Access Map as part of its efforts to aid Upstate residents facing food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic. The map includes nearly 400 providers across 10 counties complete with information on the type of assistance they provide as well as operating hours and availability. The college’s Land-Grant Local initiative worked with the United Way of Pickens County, the nonprofit organization Ten at the Top, and Clemson’s Joseph F. Sullivan Center interdisciplinary health center on the project, which provides information on different food resources across the Upstate. Currently, the map is being updated to include partners and agencies across the 46 counties in South Carolina through a grant with SCDHEC.
