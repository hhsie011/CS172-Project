Started in 1983, Coming Back Together (CBT) was the first reunion of its kind in the nation. Every three years, Black and Latino alumni come back to campus to celebrate their accomplishments, meet current students, and stay involved with the University. During CBT, you can enjoy a full range of special activities, such as distinguished speakers; networking, social, and academic events; and of course, the thrill of an SU football game! You also have the opportunity to speak with current students, and share your post-college experiences with them. Both students and alumni benefit from these conversations, so please consider participating. Find information about the next CBT as well as regional CBT events, at cbt.syr.edu.
