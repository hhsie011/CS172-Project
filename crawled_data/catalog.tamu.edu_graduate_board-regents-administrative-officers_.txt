Objectives of the Graduate and Professional School The Graduate and Professional School maintains the official record for each graduate student, and in this role serves as the primary administrative body and overarching source of information for graduate education. Once a graduate student is accepted by an academic department, school or college, the Graduate and Professional School assists and facilitates progression toward completion of a graduate degree through maintenance of all official records. The Graduate and Professional School interacts directly with the Graduate and Professional Council and Graduate Operations Committee to set minimal University guidelines, and all departments and colleges use these as a framework for operation, only setting more stringent standards when needed and appropriate. Clearance for graduation, including final review of theses, dissertations, and records of study when required, is performed by the Graduate and Professional School, but the Office of the Registrar is responsible for issuing all transcripts. The overall objective of graduate and professional studies is to provide a student with the intellectual depth and breadth, appropriate training, and professional development necessary to pursue a productive career in a profession and/or in various fields of teaching and research and in other ways make a larger contribution to society than would be otherwise possible. A graduate student is admitted for graduate study in a department to pursue generally only one of the university graduate programs at a time. Such programs are usually accessible by admission into a single department. A select number of combined degree programs allow a student the opportunity to pursue two degrees simultaneously. For a listing of the approved combined degree programs, a student should consult the graduate and professional catalog and his/her department. In some cases, an intercollegiate faculty oversees the programs allowing access through several departments. Each department has one or more graduate program directors and graduate advisors who can provide information about specific programs within that department. A student’s program of graduate study may consist of a combination of coursework, independent study and scholarly research resulting in a report, record of study, master’s thesis or doctoral dissertation. In some programs, a student may be required to participate in an internship or other professional activity to satisfy particular degree requirements. Some departments require a student’s participation in teaching as part of the degree program. Administration of Graduate and Professional Studies The graduate faculty at Texas A&M University consists of the President, the Provost and Executive Vice President, the Associate Provosts, the Deans of all subject-matter colleges, selected Directors and properly qualified academic groups. Members of the graduate faculty participate in the graduate degree programs of the University by serving on student advisory committees and teaching graduate courses. Individuals who are not members of the graduate faculty of Texas A&M University may not teach graduate courses or serve on student advisory committees unless special approval is granted by the Graduate and Professional School. Graduate and Professional School Administrative Officers Associate Provost and Dean of the Graduate and Professional School – Karen L. Butler-Purry, Ph.D. Senior Associate Dean of the Graduate and Professional School – George B. Cunningham, Ph.D. Associate Dean of the Graduate and Professional School – Julie Harlin, Ph.D. Associate Dean of the Graduate and Professional School – Adam Seipp, Ph.D. Graduate and Professional Council The Graduate and Professional Council (GPC) is composed of representatives from the graduate faculty at Texas A&M. The Council develops and maintains policies and procedures pertaining to graduate programs at the university. The Council’s function includes long-range planning, recommendation of new programs and courses, evaluation of existing programs and courses, and facilitation of university accreditation. Requests for new courses and programs, as well as changes to or withdrawals of existing courses or programs, are submitted through the Curricular Approval Request System (CARS), and questions may be sent via e-mail to gpcadmin@tamu.edu. The Graduate and Professional Council shall review all curricular requests pertaining to the graduate and professional academic programs, shall be responsible for the quality and development of the graduate instruction and programs, and shall advise the Associate Provost and Dean of the Graduate and Professional School on all graduate and professional program matters. The Council shall have the authority to create standing and ad hoc committees as necessary to carry out its duties and responsibilities. The Graduate and Professional Council shall communicate in writing, through its administrator, recommendations to the Faculty Senate by way of the Executive Committee. Membership shall consist of one representative from each college and off-campus academic unit who shall be selected by the Faculty Senate Executive Committee after consultation with the college deans and caucuses (chairs of the college committees for graduate instruction shall be considered for appointment); two representatives of the Graduate Faculty; two graduate students; and the Associate Provost and Dean for the Graduate and Professional School as an ex-officio member. All faculty representatives shall be members of the Graduate Faculty. All faculty members shall serve three-year terms. Those serving on a committee as a result of their position at Texas A&M University shall continue to serve as long as they are in that position. Student members shall serve one-year terms. To ensure continuity, the Associate Provost and Dean of the Graduate and Professional School shall serve as Chair of the Graduate and Professional Council. All the above members – except the Associate Provost and Dean of the Graduate and Professional School – shall be voting members. In the absence of an appointed member, a substitute may vote on behalf of that unit. A representative from the Graduate and Professional School and one representative of the University Library Council shall serve as non-voting members. In addition, a representative from Curricular Services shall provide advice and serve as a non-voting member. A representative from the Graduate and Professional School shall serve as the Administrative Assistant but shall not have voting privileges.

It focuses primarily on operations and procedures regarding administration of graduate education throughout the University. The Graduate Operations Committee serves as a forum for the Associate Deans in each College to discuss issues/concerns of an operational nature, and to recommend procedures, which are as uniform as possible across Colleges, to resolve these issues/concerns. The Graduate Operations Committee works very closely with the Graduate and Professional Council to coordinate all curriculum and policy issues. It also works closely with the Academic Operations Committee to consider recommendations concerning operations and procedures. Each academic College is represented on the Graduate Operations Committee by the Associate Dean (or other named individual) responsible for graduate studies in that college.
