Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) The FAQ documents on the CUIMC COVID Vaccine Information page continue to be updated, so please check the site for the latest versions. As of today, over 47,000 faculty, staff, and students at NewYork-Presbyterian, Weill Cornell, and Columbia have received their first dose of the vaccine and more than 40,000 have received second doses. This includes over 29,000 first and second doses administered on the CUIMC campus alone. Below is the Question of the Day: Are there any long or short term effects of vaccine for people with asthma? The FDA specifically wanted the participants in the COVID-19 vaccine trials to be diverse. Thus, both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine trials were designed to increase the number of persons from racial and ethnic minorities, as well as those with medical conditions (e.g., chronic lung disease, cardiac disease, severe obesity, diabetes, HIV, etc.) that placed them at higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease. 21-22% of participants had the medical conditions as above, and approximately 5-8% of participants (several thousand) had lung disease including asthma. The vaccine safety (side effects/reactions) and efficacy were similar in all of these subgroups. Thank you and stay safe!
