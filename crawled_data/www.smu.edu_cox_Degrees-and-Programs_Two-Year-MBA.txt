SMU Cox was a whirlwind of classes, new faces, coffee, and late nights. What made it the most memorable in the chaos of diving back into academia, were the people. Working on cases and drawing on every inch of the whiteboard with one or two close friends until the building shut down for the night. Traveling to foreign countries with people you just met – and coming back with incredible stories. What made SMU Cox so memorable to me is exactly what made the experience so valuable, the people. You put 120 odd folks together for two years and in the end, you have a family. Jean Perez, Two Year MBA 2016 Deloitte – Consultant, Finance SMU Cox was a turning point both in my career and in my personal life. It enabled me to acquire the new skills I was seeking and empowered me to land the job I wanted. In complement to that, I learned so many things about myself and grew a lot as a father, a husband, a colleague, and a friend. My time at SMU Cox was one of the most enriching experiences of my life, and I am very proud of my involvement with the community through clubs and case competitions, which make those two years even more memorable. Jennifer Kesterson, Two Year MBA 2015 UBS Financial Services – Financial Advisor, Wealth Management My experience at SMU Cox was incredible! I received my BBA from SMU Cox as well, so being able to come back 7 years later to experience it again, at a higher level, was amazing. I love SMU more than words can express, and wish that everyone could look back and say they had a great experience at both an undergrad, and graduate level. The network and people that I have met throughout the years in every city that I have every traveled to or lived in is invaluable. I know that no matter where I go, or what company I work for, there will always be an SMU Pony there who will be an immediate friend and/or helping hand. We Cox Alumna are everywhere, and am beyond proud to be a "double Cox pony"!! Jump To A Section Next Steps Have a question? Join us for an upcoming event to learn more about our MBA programs.
