The School of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies (TDPS) at the University of Maryland (UMD) offers undergraduate and graduate programs that rank among the top in the country. The school creates a rich and productive learning environment that is part of a larger, comprehensive liberal arts experience provided in part by the College of Arts & Humanities and with the resources of a public research university. TDPS encourages the development of inclusive and diverse cultural perspectives. Students develop fundamental life skills, intellectual curiosity, creative thinking, problem solving, embodied learning and emotional intelligence—creatively applied to advance human welfare in all its dimensions. Alumni transition to a rich variety of career pathways within and outside of theatre and dance professions, working as arts managers, choreographers, directors, performers, designers, lawyers, business entrepreneurs, professors, published authors, teachers and consultants. The school serves locally and nationally as a model for collaboration, innovation and entrepreneurship. The educational offerings in TDPS are administered by 16 tenured or tenure-track faculty; numerous adjunct faculty, international guest artists, visiting scholars; 6 administrative staff; and 56 graduate associates. We currently serve about 150 undergraduates in the B.A. Theatre program, about 60 undergraduates in the B.A. Dance program, 27 graduate students in the M.F.A. Design program, 9 graduate students in the M.F.A. Dance program, and 21 graduate students in the M.A./Ph.D. Theatre and Performance Studies program. Visiting artists and scholars regularly enhance these programs and provide additional perspectives that enhance the student experience.
