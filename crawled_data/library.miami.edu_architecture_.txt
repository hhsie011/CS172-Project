Architecture collections are housed in several locations; the ARC, the Otto G. Richter Library, and the Rome Program Library in Rome, Italy, and in our off-site storage facility. The ARC maintains a circulating core collection of monographs on architecture, urban design and planning, landscape architecture, technology and environmental responsibility in the built environment, and more, plus over 80 current, international architecture and design related journals. Supplemental materials and some journal back files are housed between the Otto G. Richter Library and off-site storage. The architecture library is a unique center for information about South Florida that reflects the School’s programs in urban resilience and sustainability, urban design and urban planning, tropical and sub-tropical architecture, and historic preservation. The collections are robust in the architecture and urbanism of Latin America and the Caribbean basin, all periods of Italian architecture and urbanism, and global architecture of the 20th and 21st centuries. The ARC houses growing print and electronic archival collections that include the Center for Urban and Community Design Archives (CUCD), the Archive of the New Urbanism, and the School of Architecture archives.
