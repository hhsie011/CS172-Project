We assist Clemson researchers in taking advantage of the new types of scholarship and modes of dissemination made possible through advances in technology and eliminating copyright barriers to digital information. Copyright Consultations We offer brief courses on copyright and fair-use decision making. We also check copyright permissions to assist researchers in making their previously published research more openly available, provide support for negotiating the terms of publication agreements in support of open dissemination, and help researchers broaden the impact of their work. Open Access Publishing Fund We support authors who wish to explore open access publication models. The Libraries has committed to seeding a fund to underwrite the journal processing fees (up to $1,500) of Clemson University authors who choose to publish their research articles in peer-reviewed, reputable open-access journals, monographs, or conference proceedings. Open Access Publishing Fund Open Educational Resources We work with instructors and students to help find open resources for use in the classroom. There is a world of high-quality educational materials available to students at zero cost, and we can help you find and incorporate them into your lessons. Open Educational Resources TigerPrints Our institutional repository supports Clemson researchers in publishing article manuscripts, theses and dissertations, posters, conference proceedings, and other types of scholarship that may not be broadly disseminated. We also support the preservation and distribution of conferences held on campus and serve as a publishing platform through which Clemson researchers can make their works available to the world. Tigerprints Predatory Publishing Predatory publishing affects many facets of academia, from graduate students publishing their first articles to tenure applications to evaluating research impact. We offer training and consultations on how to recognize predatory publishers (and conferences) and evaluate potential publication venues (both traditional and open access). We offer workshops throughout the year and are also available for individual consultations, quick questions, or to speak to small groups on specific topics.
