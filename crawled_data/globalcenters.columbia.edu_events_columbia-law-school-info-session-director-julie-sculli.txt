7:30 PM Columbia Global Centers | Rio de Janeiro The director of the Executive LL.M. in Global Business Law at Columbia Law School, Julie Sculli, will be here at Columbia Global Centers | Rio de Janeiro for an informative session about the Columbia Executive LL.M. in Global Business Law, which is an accelerated hybrid program designed for high-achieving, experienced lawyers looking to gain advanced knowledge of U.S. and international business law to better serve their clients and advance their international legal practice. Built to maximize flexibility for practicing lawyers, this program allows students to complete their LL.M. degree in six months, through a combination of three online courses and an intensive May through August residency at Columbia’s campus in New York. During the residency period, the substantive law courses are supplemented by co-curricular programming on leadership, management, and effective presentation in both writing and in-person. You can learn more about the program at one of our upcoming information sessions or apply now to begin in March 2020! REGISTER HERE!
