I’m really proud of all of you.” He said that the awards honor the researchers’ “extraordinary work that makes a difference to the lives of the world.” Fitts also noted that research at Tulane has recently experienced an incredible period of growth. “Over the last five years our federal funding has gone up close to 50 percent.” “In looking at you, you are the past, present and the future of Tulane University. I’m really proud of all of you.” MIKE FITTS, President of Tulane Dr. Giovanni Piedimonte, vice president for research, whose office organized the awards’ selection and ceremony, said that 2020 was a record year in Tulane’s history for total research and federal research funding. “Even more remarkable, these records were set in the midst of the worst pandemic of the century.” Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost Robin Forman also took the stage. He said that although it’s the first time the university has held the event, the university’s researchers and their work are often discussed among colleagues. “We’re sharing our sense of excitement and pride in your latest discoveries, ideas and creations, in your latest books and papers and latest collaborations,” Forman said.
