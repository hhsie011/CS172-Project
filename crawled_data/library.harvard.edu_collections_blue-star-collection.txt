Angela Davis broadside, Broadside Press Woodberry Poetry Room The Woodberry Poetry Room's Blue Star collection is a non-circulating collection of rare or limited-edition monographs, chapbooks, serials, typescripts, mimeographs, broadsides, photographs, and correspondence. The collection serves to augment scholars' understanding of the authors whose works we have recorded for our A/V archive; to document the work of Boston-area poets and small presses; and to illuminate aspects of the Poetry Room's literary, social, and architectural history.
