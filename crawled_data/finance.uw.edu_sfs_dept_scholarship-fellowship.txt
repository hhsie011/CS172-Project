Depending on the terms of the budget, these payments may be paid directly to the student, or can be applied directly to the student account to pay allowable expenses such as tuition, student insurance or related fees. These payments are authorized by the department managing the budget, and are disbursed through the Student Database (SDB). Departmental Responsibilities Determine appropriate budgets to use, type of budget, and the allowable expenses the budget may pay Authorize or verify the budget set-up terms in SDB Request Budget Access for department budgets on SDB, when needed Determine student award recipients (amount of award and correct academic quarter/s) Authorize department student awards online in the Student Database (SDB) Confirm that student awards posted are accurately disbursed to recipients Reconcile budgets regularly - dollar amount posted to correct student for authorized quarter/s Authorizing Student Awards Departments that wish to disburse funds to students from departmental budgets must have the budget set-up in SDB.
