As a medium-sized program, we offer an intimate setting that fosters tightly-knit cohorts and that offers the opportunity to work closely with world-class scholars in research and teaching. Our department consists of a community of scholars – graduate students, undergraduates, and faculty – who share the values of the pursuit of history: exacting research in first-hand materials, critical context building, and the analysis of problems in the long term. We aim for a diverse intellectual atmosphere and a diverse student body, and prize comparative, connective, and collaborative thinking across chronological and geographical borders. Our PhD program is designed to help students develop flexible skill sets that will enable them to meet their professional and intellectual goals. Recipients of Brown graduate degrees hold positions in many distinguished educational institutions around the world; they also work in consultancies, foundations, museums, and archives, and in politics and media. We also offer an MA to currently-enrolled Brown students through the 5th year MA program (for undergraduates) and the Open Graduate Education program (for PhD students in other departments.) The PhD Program page is the starting place for prospective and current doctoral students. Here you will find detailed information and descriptions of what our current students are working on. Our Admissions page leads to information on deadlines and requirements for applying to our programs. We accept graduate applications in twelve major fields of study; as you will see on the linked individual faculty pages, our intersecting and developing research interests reach well beyond those. All prospective and current graduate students are encouraged to consult the Department of History Graduate Handbook, which provides an overview of the PhD and MA programs and contains much additional useful information. The MA Program page offers curriculum guidelines for currently-enrolled MA students and prospective applicants to the Fifth Year MA and Open Graduate Education programs for Brown students. Please note that applications for the terminal MA program in History are no longer being accepted as of November 2018. Fellowships and Financial aid provides an overview of major internal and external sources of funding. Our Careers page features professional initiatives, community workshops, and information about where our department alumni are now. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
