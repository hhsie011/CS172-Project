Goals of the project include lifting the voices of Asian-American early educators and shining a light on their contributions and burdens, as well as developing a pilot support program to mitigate the adverse impact of racial trauma on Asian-American early educators. “Asian-American early educators are three times as likely to be the target of either physical or verbal racialized aggression (23.1% versus 7.7%) and have reported the highest levels of stress throughout the pandemic, relative to other early educators in the U.S.” according to the announcement of the project. ~~~ Visit the Yale Child Study Center website to learn more.
