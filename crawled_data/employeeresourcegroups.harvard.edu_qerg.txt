Since 2003, we have been meeting informally -- finding each other here or there and building a community. We will use this space in the future to detail this history and the incredible efforts of others. In the meantime, join us as we forge a new group together. Mission and Goals Executive Committee Newsletters Resources The mission of the LGBTQ Staff and Faculty Employee Resource Group (QERG) of Harvard University is to ensure that Harvard is a welcoming and inclusive workplace for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, nonbinary, and queer employees. The QERG works with the University’s many schools, offices, Harvard University Police, and LGBTQ leaders in our shared goal of ensuring Harvard is a great place to both work and learn.The QERG serves as a visible, accessible resource for LGBTQ employees and will provide recruitment, networking and career development opportunities. A link enabled version of the newsletter is available here.
