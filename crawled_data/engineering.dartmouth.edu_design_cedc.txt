CEDC coordinates industry-sponsored projects for the capstone BE design course sequence (ENGS 89/90) and the MEng design course sequence (ENGG 199.1/199.11). On This Page BE Design Projects MEng Design Projects Project Examples Leadership History Contact Us BE Design Projects ENGS 89/90 Course Sequence CEDC projects form the heart of Dartmouth's capstone BE design course sequence, "ENGS 89/90: Engineering Design Methodology & Project Initiation/Completion." Each project runs from mid September to early March with students working in teams of three to eight depending on the scope of the project. More about sponsoring a BE project MEng Design Projects ENGG 199.1/199.11 Course Sequence Students in Dartmouth's MEng degree program may elect to complete an industry-sponsored project through the advanced course sequence, "ENGG 199.1/199.11: MEng Design Project Initiation/Completion." Projects are matched to student teams in October/November with work beginning in early January and completing at the end of May.

Monroe, Director As CEDC director, Emily leverages her experience to connect industry sponsors with Dartmouth Engineering students. Prior to joining Dartmouth, Emily was the lead engineer at Kudos, where she ran new product development for the first disposable baby diaper with 100% cotton against baby’s skin. She also served as a manufacturing engineer at Sturm, Ruger and Co. and as an R&D design engineer at Johnson & Johnson’s Ethicon Endo-Surgery. Emily holds a BS degree in mechanical engineering from MIT and an MEM degree from Duke University. She is a member of Tau Beta Pi and Phi Beta Kappa honor societies. Outside of the CEDC, she is an avid reader, a co-parent of four young children, and a process improvement superfan. History Legacy & Origin CEDC was established in 1978 to create a bridge between industry and Thayer. Several companies signed on to provide financial support and bring in projects for graduate engineering students, who would work in close collaboration with industry representatives. Former board member John Brown Cook '29 was an early and enthusiastic supporter of CEDC. After Cook's death in 1979, his widow, Marian Miner Cook, succeeded him on the board and made a significant financial gift to CEDC. Originally called INVENTE, CEDC was then renamed. Impact & Innovation During its first five years (1979–1984), more companies joined with an increase in industry-funded research. The Cook Center Associates Program was established in 1983 as a mechanism to generate and maintain a continuing relationship with interested companies. During Dean Elsa Garmire's tenure, CEDC became a virtual center with a formalized fee structure for projects and processes by which corporate partners were recruited.
