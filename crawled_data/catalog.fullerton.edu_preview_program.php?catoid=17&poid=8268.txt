Please consult the Graduate Admissions section in this catalog for complete information. In addition, applicants must meet the following requirements: An undergraduate degree in chemistry or a selection of science courses deemed as adequate preparation for further study in chemistry by the Department Graduate Committee At least a 2.75 GPA in science courses The GRE general examination, with score reported to the department Placement Examinations All students are required to take and pass placement examinations or take and pass the appropriate courses with a “B” (3.0) or better. Graduate students in one of the chemistry options must demonstrate competency by passing four placement examinations in the following five areas of chemistry: analytical, inorganic, organic, physical and/or biochemistry. Graduate students in the biochemistry option must demonstrate competency in thefollowing areas of chemistry: analytical, organic, biochemistry, as well as either physical or biology. A student may take each placement examination two times within the first year of enrolling in the graduate program. A student who does not pass the placement examinations within the first year must demonstrate competency by passing with a “B” (3.0) or better the appropriate courses within two years after first enrolling. The appropriate courses are: CHEM 301B for organic; CHEM 315 for analytical; CHEM 325 for inorganic; CHEM 361A , CHEM 361B for physical (biochemistry option); CHEM 371A , CHEM 371B for physical (chemistry option); CHEM 423A , CHEM 423B for biochemistry; and BIOL 273 for biology. Classified Standing In order to proceed from conditionally classified to classified standing, a student must meet the following requirements: Demonstration of competency in any three of the areas, as described above Approved selection of a research director An approved study plan The university graduate-level writing requirement Study Plan Three alternatives are available for the study plan. The student can complete either a laboratory thesis (strongly preferred) a library thesis, or project. The degree program consists of graduate committee-approved coursework completed with a minimum GPA of 3.0 in all coursework exclusive of CHEM 505A , CHEM 505B and CHEM 599 . Each student prepares a study plan in consultation with the graduate program adviser, which must be approved by the student’s research director, the department, and the Office of Graduate Studies. All chemistry courses on the study plan must be 400 level or above. Study plans may contain no more than 2 units of CHEM 505A , CHEM 505B , and no more than 6 units of CHEM 599 (3 units for students electing the library thesis alternative). Basic requirements Courses required of all students: CHEM 505A - Seminar (Participation) (1) CHEM 505B - Seminar (Presentation) (1) CHEM 599 - Independent Graduate Research (1-6) CHEM 598 - Thesis (1-6) or CHEM 597 - Project (1-6) Core and Elective Requirements A minimum of 18 units of adviser-approved coursework are required, at least nine units of which must be the 500 level. Nine of these units must be core courses in the student’s area of specialization, as follows: Analytical CHEM 511 - Advanced Analytical Chemistry (3) CHEM 512 - Advanced Instrumentation (3) CHEM 552 - Kinetics and Spectroscopy (3) Biochemistry CHEM 541 - Protein Biochemistry (3) CHEM 542 - Nucleic Acid Chemistry (3) CHEM 546 - Metabolism and Catalysis (3) Inorganic CHEM 425 - Advanced Inorganic Chemistry (3) CHEM 431 - Advanced Organic Chemistry (3) CHEM 552 - Kinetics and Spectroscopy (3) Organic CHEM 431 - Advanced Organic Chemistry (3) CHEM 535 - Organic Synthesis (3) Physical CHEM 512 - Advanced Instrumentation (3) CHEM 551 - Quantum Chemistry (3) CHEM 552 - Kinetics and Spectroscopy (3) Total (30 units) Back to Top | Print Degree Planner (opens a new window) | Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Facebook this Page (opens a new window) Tweet this Page (opens a new window) All catalogs © 2022 California State University Fullerton.
