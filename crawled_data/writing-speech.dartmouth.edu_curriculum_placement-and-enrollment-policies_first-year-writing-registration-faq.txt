During orientation week just before the start of fall term, when incoming students get access to DartWorks via DartHub, information about your writing placement and which term you are assigned to take Writing 5 (if relevant) will appear in the DartWorks degree audit section labelled "Prematriculation Credits and Exemptions." Information on interpreting the information in this section of DartWorks can be found on the Registrar's website at: http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/guides/credits/qrg_placement.pdf Please note that students who have been accepted into an approved equivalent of Writing 5 (such as fall Humanities 1) will receive notification and additional instructions for registration via email but may still show a term assignment for Writing 5 in the system. This is normal and expected. This represents your term assignment for Writing 5 should you change your mind about participation in the approved equivalent of Writing 5 and decide to take Writing 5 instead. More information about the writing placement process can be found on our website here: First-year Writing Choices Where can I find descriptions for Writing 5 sections or First-year Seminar courses? For descriptions for the current or upcoming term, view the following pages on the website of the Office of the Registrar. These pages update to display information for the next term shortly before registration begins for the next term. Individual Writing 5 section descriptions for the current or upcoming term First-year Seminar course descriptions for the current or upcoming term For archived descriptions from past terms, visit these pages on our website: Archived Writing 5 section descriptions from recent past terms Archived First-year Seminar course descriptions from recent past terms The Writing 5 sections and First-year Seminar courses offered vary from year to year, but each year there is a similarly wide array of topics offered. Does it matter what time of day I enter my course elections in the course registration system? During initial course election, anytime before the deadline is fine (although don't wait too late in case you run into technical difficulties that need resolving). BUT once course changes period and the add-drop period begin, course election is first-come, first-served, so earlier is better if you want to have the most choices. Details on the dates for initial course election, the date and time when course results become available, and the dates for course changes and add-drop periods can be found on the Registrar's website. How do I know whether I got into the Writing 5 or First-year Seminar I elected? Check in the DartHub registration system on the day that initial course election results become available. Details on the dates for initial course election, the date and time when course results become available, and the dates for the course change and add-drop periods can be found on the Registrar's website. If you didn't get into the WRIT 5 section you asked for, you will need to register ASAP for another WRIT 5 section with space available as early as you can after the course change period opens. Similarly, if you didn't get into the First-Year Seminar you asked for, you will need to register ASAP for another First-Year Seminar with space available as early as you can after the course changes period opens. The Writing 5 or First-year Seminar course I wanted to take is full. Should I try asking the professor to let me in above the limit? No. Professors are not allowed to add students above the enrollment limit in a Writing 5 or First-year Seminar class. Writing 5 and First-year Seminar class sizes are limited to 16 students to allow for individualized attention. Enrollment above the limit is never allowed in a Writing 5 or First-year Seminar course. Open slots are first-come, first-served. No waiting lists are maintained. For additional advice about switching between sections of Writing 5 or between First-year Seminar courses, please visit our switch page. It is orientation week, and I am in WRIT 2-3 and want to switch into WRIT 5, or I am in WRIT 5 and want to be put on the waitlist for WRIT 2-3. Who should I contact?

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Institute for Writing and Rhetoric Philosophy & Aims About Writing at Dartmouth Speech at Dartmouth Our Stories The Story of Writing Instruction at Dartmouth The Story of Speech at Dartmouth The Story of Writing Support at Dartmouth Curriculum Overview Writing Courses Writing 2-3 WRIT 5 First-Year Seminars Humanities 1-2 Speech Courses Speech 20 Speech 25 Speech 26 Speech 27 Speech 30 Speech 31 Speech 33 Speech 34 Speech 36 Speech 37 Speech 40 Placement and Enrollment Policies First-Year Writing & First-Year Seminar Requirements Differences Among First-Year Writing Courses FAQ Directed Self-Placement Process for Writing Registration for Writing 5 or Writing 2-3 Registration for First Year Seminars FAQ First-year Writing Registration First-year Writing Choices Prizes Writing Prize Winners Speech Contest Winners Speech Contest Call for Entries Learning Overview Writing Center Make an Appointment Materials Sources and Citations at Dartmouth Teaching Overview Guidelines Teaching Writing in the First Year Expectations for Writing 2-3 Expectations for Writing 5 Teaching the First-Year Seminar First-Year Writing: Pedagogies, Methods, & Design Active Learning in the First-Year Writing Classroom Syllabus and Assignment Design Teaching Writing as Process Integrating Reading and Writing Diagnosing and Responding to Student Writing Conducting Writing Workshops Collaborative Learning/Learning with Peers Teaching Argument Teaching Research Addressing Grammar Useful links Support The Writing Assistant Program Research Past Research Activities Research Overview Multilingual Overview Support for Undergraduate Students Support for Graduate Students Faculty Support News & People People News Employment Upcoming Events Past Events My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
