News People Papers Teaching Press Carl Vondrick Assistant Professor of Computer Science Columbia University Office: 618 CEPSR Address: 530 West 120th St, New York, NY 10027 Email: vondrick at cs dot columbia dot edu Research Our group studies computer vision and applied machine learning. By training machines to observe and interact with their surroundings, we aim to create robust and versatile models for perception. We often investigate visual models that capitalize on large amounts of unlabeled data and transfer across tasks and modalities. Other interests include scene dynamics, sound and language and beyond, interpretable models, and perception for robotics. Our group is part of the Visual Computing and Machine Learning ecosystem at Columbia. Prospective PhD students should apply here. News Congratulations to Sachit for his UAI 2022 paper!
