The undergraduate program in sociology provides a general analysis and broad understanding of human societies and culture for persons in all fields. Selecting courses around a topic or theme of interest adds meaning to one’s education and strengthens the base of understanding from which one can pursue a career or further education. Two options are currently available for those interested — Crime and Justice, and Environmental and Natural Resource Sociology — although students can shape a custom theme such as international development or social policy. A minimum of 48 credits of sociology coursework, to include the following: SOC 204 - Introduction to Sociology - 3 credits (prerequisite to all upper division courses) SOC 315 - Methods I - Research Design - 4 credits (prerequisites: SOC 204 and junior standing) SOC 316 - Methods II: Quantitative Analysis - 4 credits (prerequisites: SOC 204, SOC 315, and junior standing) SOC 413 - Sociological Theory - 4 credits (prerequisites: SOC 204 and junior standing) Sociology Electives - 33 credits (see INTEREST AREAS below) Additional recommendations and restrictions: A GPA of 2.5 must be earned in sociology course work.
