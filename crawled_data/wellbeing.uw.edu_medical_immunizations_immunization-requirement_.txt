Learn more here. Your Requirement All entering UW students must provide evidence of immunity to: Measles (Rubeola) – two vaccinations, both administered after the age of one (12 months) and given at least 28 days apart OR a positive blood (titer) test Mumps – two vaccinations, both administered after the age of one (12 months) and given at least 28 days apart OR a positive blood (titer) test. These are commonly given as an MMR vaccine; we still require two doses of these. If you are under 22 as of the first day of the quarter, you must also provide evidence of immunity to: Meningococcal meningitis A, C, W, and Y – one conjugate vaccination (see table below for accepted vaccines) administered on or after your 16th birthday. Accepted Meningitis ACWY Vaccinations Only Meningitis ACWY conjugate vaccines (MCV) are accepted to meet the requirement. We cannot accept meningitis polysaccharide vaccines (MPSV). Please make sure your vaccine is on the list above. Health Sciences Immunization Program (HSIP) If you are enrolled in a Health Sciences degree program, you may need to fulfill the Health Sciences Immunization Program (HSIP) requirement instead. How to submit Submit the required UW form and/or supplemental documents as a single file through our online portal. We do not accept documents by mail or physical copies. Processing times vary but are usually between 2-4 weeks. You may register for your first quarter of classes and participate in Advising & Orientation. Please make sure you combine all your documents into one file before submitting. Upload deadlines and registration holds Several extensions were granted to incoming students from Spring 2020 to Winter 2022, but moving forward, deadlines are as follows: Your First UW Quarter Submission Deadline (allows time for document review) Registration Block Winter 2022 (or earlier) 03/25/2022 04/08/2022 Spring 2022 04/15/2022 05/06/2022 Summer 2022 09/01/2022 09/28/2022 Autumn 2022 10/14/2022 11/04/2022 Winter 2023 01/28/2023 02/10/2023 Beginning Spring 2022, UW resumes the practice of placing registration holds for a student’s second quarter if they have not met the requirements by then. COVID vaccination In order to protect the health and safety of our students, faculty, academic personnel, staff and broader community, the University of Washington is requiring all students to be vaccinated against COVID-19, with certain exemptions allowed. Learn more here. Find your requirement If you are attending the Bothell, Seattle, or Tacoma campuses, you must satisfy your immunity requirement. Your requirement depends on your program of study and your age. Find the requirement below that pertains to you. Health Sciences (HS) and Speech & Hearing Sciences (SPHSC) Graduate and Select HS Undergraduate (all ages) See list of Health Sciences/SPHSC Programs See my requirement Under 22 years If you are younger than 22 years old as of the first day of instruction, find out your requirement below. See My Requirement 22 years or older If you are 22 years old or older as of the first day of instruction, find out your requirement below. See My Requirement Immunization requirement FAQ What documents should I submit? We accept: Immunization records from a clinic or hospital Transcripts that show immunizations The recommended Proof of Immunity Form in the sidebar above with a medical professional’s signature Pharmacy prescription documents/receipts for vaccines State or country government documents. For vaccinations taken in Washington state, you can use the website MyIR. Military students: we accept forms DD 214 and DD 2766, which you can find on the website eBenefits. Every document must have the student’s name and date of birth. The dates must be clearly written for each required vaccination, and must be verified by either a medical professional or an immunization report from a clinic. How do I submit my documents? Complete the Immunity Verification Requirement Form on your computer or by hand (legibly). Download the file first if you plan on filling it out on your computer; do not fill it out in your browser as it will not save. Take the form to your health care provider to sign if they have records of your immunizations. Otherwise, provide records of your vaccinations. (You do not need to have the form signed if you can provide records yourself.) Review your documents to make sure they are complete. Make sure they meet the requirements listed on our website. You may scan your documents or take a photo of them with your phone. Make sure to check the image and verify that the text can be clearly seen. Convert and merge all your documents into a single PDF file. Here is how to turn images into PDFs, and here is how to combine PDFs. Visit the Upload Portal. Enter your information in the required fields and upload your single file. This is the only way to submit documentation. We do not accept faxed or emailed documentation. Click Upload. If your document is too large, which most often happens with scanned files, you may get an error message. You will receive an automated email at your UW email account within a few minutes of submission, confirming that your documents were uploaded. This does not mean you have been cleared but that your documents have been successfully submitted for our review. If there is a problem with your submission, we will contact you by email or text message. Processing times may be longer depending on the volume of submissions. We are not able to contact all students who have been cleared; please assume you are cleared unless you hear from us. Make sure you check your UW email (@uw.edu) regularly. You can attend classes, orientation, and advising sessions before you have met your requirement, but we do ask that you get those documents in sooner than later so you can register. What are some common problems to avoid? Why might my documents be rejected? No name or a different name than what is in the student database; no date of birth to corroborate identity. No medical professional’s signature on the document. Official immunization records, such as MyChart or MyIR documents, or pharmacy prescription slips, are acceptable. Illegible handwriting on the document: Vaccinations need to be clearly labelled. Not having enough Measles or Mumps vaccines. We require two of each, through two MMR vaccines, two individual Measles and two Mumps vaccines, or a combination. Having indeterminate or negative Measles or Mumps titers. Note: Rubeola is the other name for Measles. Rubella is German Measles and is not required. Students must communicate with their healthcare provider to send their titers results or obtain the test results. The test results need to be submitted to the portal. MMRs taken before you were 1 year old. MMRs taken closer than 28 days apart. Meningitis ACWY taken before you were 16 years old. If you received your first dose younger than 16 years of age, you will need a booster dose. If you have not had it before 16 years of age, you do not need a booster. Meningitis ACWY taken in China, as that version might not be the most effective. (Versions taken in Hong Kong and Taiwan are acceptable.) Meningitis B vaccine taken instead of the ACWY variant. What do I do if I have a registration hold? Students who have not met the Measles, Mumps, or Meningococcal immunity requirement may have a registration hold placed on their student account. The hold will prevent you from registering for the next quarter’s classes. While we recognize a block on your registration is a significant disruption for students, our priority is to protect the community from infectious diseases like Measles, Mumps, and Meningitis ACWY. If you have a registration hold that references “MMM immunization requirement,” it means that, according to our records, you have not fulfilled the MMM immunity requirement. That could mean that you never uploaded documentation, uploaded incomplete or inadequate documentation, were too young when you had your MMR or Meningitis ACWY vaccines, or have not met at least one component of the requirement. To get the hold lifted: Review the MMM immunity requirement carefully (click here if you’re under 22 and here if you’re 22 or older) to make sure you understand the requirement and how to meet it. Review the Common Problems section of this FAQ. Get any vaccinations or blood tests needed: https://wellbeing.uw.edu/immunization-referrals/ Submit a signed UW form or your official vaccination records, following the instructions. Processing time varies by volume of uploads but is typically 1-3 weeks. Once we review your submission and ensure that the requirement has been met, the registration hold will be removed from your student account. If you are having difficulty meeting the requirement, please contact us at immunity@uw.edu. How can I find out the status of my submitted MMM Immunization Documents? If you have not yet fulfilled the UW MMM Immunity Verification Requirement, there will be a notice in your MyUW account. Example: However, you still may be able to register despite the notice. Please try to register as normal. If you are not able to register, please contact us at immunity@uw.edu. If you have submitted immunization documents and they were not approved, you will have received a text message. (Only if you have a local number listed in your UW account.) If you have submitted your documents, there is no notice in your account, and you have not received a text message, then you can assume that your documents have been accepted. Which students must participate in the Health Sciences Immunization Program (HSIP)? If you are in one of the following Health Sciences programs or Speech and Hearing Sciences programs, you need to meet the Health Sciences Immunization Program (HSIP) requirements which are administered by UW Environmental Health & Safety. You do not need to satisfy the general UW requirement unless you are under the age of 22. Seattle HSIP Programs Medicine (MED) MEDEX Medical Laboratory Science/Laboratory Medicine Rehab Medicine (DPT/MOT/P&O) Genetic Counseling Dentistry (DDS and most post-doctoral students) Endo/OralB/OralM/Ortho/Perio/Pros Pharmacy Doctorate (PharmD) Nursing (BSN/ABSN/DNP/Certificate) Social Work (BASW/MSW) Public Health (MPH/HIHIM/Nutrition) Speech & Hearing Sciences (SPHSC) CoreSLP/MedSLP/EdSLP/AuD/AuD-PhD Tacoma HSIP programs Social Work (BASW/MSW) Bothell HSIP programs – None. All Bothell students must follow the UW General Immunization Requirement and/or any additional requirements set by their program. Students who are under 22, including those in the HSIP Program If you are under the age of 22 as of the first day of the quarter and entering one of the programs listed above, you will need to provide proof of Meningococcal ACWY immunization in addition to your HSIP requirements: Follow the instructions to meet the requirement for students under the age of 22 but only provide proof of Meningitis ACWY immunization after the age of 16 (no need to complete the MMR section of the UW form) Meet the full HSIP requirement. Which students don’t need to meet the general Immunity Verification Requirement? The following students are excused from meeting the general requirement. (NOTE: this does not apply to the UW COVID vaccine requirement; for details on that, please visit https://www.washington.edu/coronavirus/) Students born before January 1, 1957 Students who previously matriculated at UW (i.e., previously enrolled in any program not on this list) and met the requirement then UW Summer Youth Programs Students admitted for a single quarter, including summer only OSHER Lifelong Learning Institute UW in the High School PCE Certificate Programs UW Online (100% online courses only – see below) Non-matriculated students Online students Online students are required to meet the UW Immunity Verification Requirement because as enrolled students, they have at-will access to UW facilities (libraries, labs, etc.) beyond their current mode of access to classes, which is subject to change during every registration process. Am I eligible for an exemption from all or part of the requirement? The UW does allow students to pursue permanent or temporary exemptions to all or part of the UW MMM Immunity Verification Requirement. Exemptions must be related to a documented medical issue or a religious objection and must be reviewed by a health care professional. You will need to complete this process even if you previously had an immunization exemption at another school or have an exemption to the COVID-19 vaccines. To obtain an exemption form and to begin the process, fill out this form and have it signed by a health care provider. Medical exemptions must be filled out by a doctor. Religious exemption Medical exemption Students participating in the Health Sciences Immunization Program (HSIP) please refer to the HSIP webpage for information regarding exemptions. What if I can’t afford the cost of immunizations or bloodwork (titers)? Some students are concerned about the cost of immunizations or titers needed to meet the requirement. Below are some strategies you can use to get immunizations affordably. If you have health insurance: All US health insurance plans are required to cover the full cost of routine immunizations as long as you visit an in-network provider. Find a contracted provider by visiting your insurer’s website and using the “find a doctor” tool. You can also get MMR and Meningitis ACWY immunizations at many pharmacies. Out-of-state students may need to plan ahead by getting their immunizations in their home state if their insurance doesn’t cover the cost of services in WA. If you don’t have health insurance, apply for health insurance. You can find detailed instructions on how to apply on our website. As long as you remain without health insurance, you will be stuck paying the full cost of your health care. Note: Undocumented students and DACA recipients may not be able to get health insurance. If you can’t get health insurance, your first stop should be a community health clinic. These are clinics that receive funds from the government to offer low-cost health care, often on a sliding scale. They usually offer immunizations and lab tests. You will need to schedule an appointment with a provider to establish care, and in some cases talk to a patient navigator to determine your eligibility for financial assistance. If you don’t have health insurance and cannot visit a community clinic, your best option is to call local pharmacies in your area and ask for their immunization pricing. Then, get your immunizations at the pharmacy with the best price. Please refer to the immunization referrals page to find low-cost and nearby clinics near every campus. I have questions. How do I get help? You can email your questions to immunity@uw.edu. Please include your student ID number in your email. Due to high email volumes, you may have to wait for your answer, so read the website carefully first. You can also call us at 206-616-4672. If we are not able to answer at that time, please leave a voicemail. We will email you in return if you leave your name, student ID number, and concern. Can I come to Hall Health Center or the Registrar’s Office to release my registration hold? Do not go to the Hall Health Center without an appointment. Hall Health is not able to accept walk-ins at this time. If you are looking to receive Immunizations, please contact 206-616-2495 to make an appointment. Hall Health staff are not able to address registration holds or uploaded immunization documents sent through the portal. Managing this requirement is an administrative responsibility led by the MMM Immunization Verification Program. Do not go to the Office of the University Registrar or campus registration office for help releasing your registration hold regarding your immunization requirements, as they will not be able to help you, and will redirect you to this site as well.
