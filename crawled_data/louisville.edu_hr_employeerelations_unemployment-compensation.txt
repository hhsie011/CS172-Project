This office does not make the decision as to whether or not an individual receives benefits. Eligibility for unemployment insurance is determined solely by the Kentucky Office of Employment and Training, Division of Unemployment Insurance. Employer Address to use for UofL Unemployment Claims All claimants who file for unemployment benefits must provide the address of Human Resources as the address of their last employer. That address is: University of Louisville Human Resources 1980 Arthur Street Louisville, KY 40208 Refer Unemployment Inquiries to Us When faculty and staff are needed as witnesses, or for documentation regarding separation of an employee, they will be notified by Employee Relations. If a state or local unemployment office should contact your office asking questions regarding the termination of an employee, refer them to Employee Relations at (502) 852-6258. It is not appropriate to provide employee information without first consulting Human Resources. If an appeal is necessary, Employee Relations will notify the appropriate University personnel and inform them of the hearing dates and times. A staff member from Employee Relations will accompany departmental representatives to the hearing. Most appeal hearings are held via teleconference. For additional information, please email Employee Relations.
