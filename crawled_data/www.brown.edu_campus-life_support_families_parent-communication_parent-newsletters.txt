There is so much going on that your student may not remember to tell you -- or that you want to know without asking your student. The Brown Parent & Family Newsletter is issued several times each year with information about resources, projects, and events on campus. We hope to let you know about new initiatives and provide reminders of resources you might wish to recommend to your student. The newsletter, emailed to parents/guardians of enrolled undergraduates, includes the following recent editions: Fall 2021 Spring 2021 Fall 2020 Spring 2020 Spring 2019 Fall 2018 Spring 2018 Fall 2017 Spring 2017 December 2016 September 2016 Please encourage your student to review and maintain your address information in their Banner record.
