German Chatterbox 1.0 German Chatterbox 1.0 is a program that allows language learners to practice German vocabulary, grammatical form and cultural awareness by communicating with 10 life-like virtual chat partners about a range of personal and professional interests. Each chat partner features read-out-loud vocabulary lists, microphone input and downloadable worksheets that can be assigned in class or at home. The online application is under development by the German Department's Language Director Nick Ostrau. Grammar Review Grammatik is a systematic survey of German grammar by Emeritus Professor Bruce Duncan. TV and Video Resources The Dartmouth campus DarTV carries two German stations: Deutsche Welle and, for more popular fare, Pro7Sat1world. In the iTunes Music Store, a search on “ZDF” produces everything from audio and video “Nachrichten” to “Der Krimi Podcast” to children’s “Podcast der Logo.” They are about 30 minutes each and are updated every day. Two other valuable sites for downloadable and streaming media: tagesschau.de and dradio.de. Annotext Annotext is a web-based application that was developed at Dartmouth College to assist students in understanding linguistically difficult literary texts.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of German Studies Undergraduate Overview Why Study German?
