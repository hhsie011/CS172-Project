OSU-Tulsa offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs in areas including business, education, engineering and technology, human services and liberal arts. Undergraduate students generally transfer to OSU-Tulsa after earning their associate degree or completing about 45 hours of freshman and sophomore-level coursework. OSU-Tulsa students graduate with the same OSU degree that students in Stillwater receive. OSU-Tulsa’s downtown location adds to the value of that degree by giving students access to the internship and volunteer opportunities, cultural attractions and social scene that come with an urban campus. Research Focused Since OSU-Tulsa is a comprehensive research institution, students have the opportunity to participate in research that impacts Tulsa-area businesses, communities and families and changes the lives of those in need. The Helmerich Research Center is a state-of-the-art facility for materials science and engineering research with an emphasis on partnering with industry to commercialize that research. The OSU Center for Family Resilience focuses on research that addresses everyday issues confronted by families and helps transform that research into practice. OSU’s research focus and reputation for high quality pay off — salaries for OSU graduates are higher than those of many regional and online-only institutions. Making College Possible for Working Adults OSU-Tulsa’s class schedules are created to help students balance busy lives with earning a degree: Most on-campus classes are offered one night a week. Most on-campus classes start at 4:30 p.m. or later. Online and hybrid class options are also available. Hybrid classes combine the convenience of online classes with some in-class sessions for networking and face-to-face interaction. Earning an OSU degree in Tulsa is affordable, too. OSU was named a 2017 Best Value college by Kiplinger’s — the 14th time it has received this recognition. OSU-Tulsa has awarded nearly $3 million in scholarships since 2005, and awards thousands of dollars in grants and financial aid each year. Since OSU-Tulsa’s undergraduate students are all transfer students, many spend their freshman and sophomore years at local two-year colleges, which typically have lower costs.
