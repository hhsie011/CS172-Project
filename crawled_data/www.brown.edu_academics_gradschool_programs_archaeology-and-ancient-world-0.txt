Graduate study of Archaeology and Ancient World focuses on the ancient Mediterranean, Egypt and Near East (the latter broadly construed as extending from Anatolia and the Levant to the Caucasus), and is based in the Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology. The program combines a flexible interdisciplinary atmosphere with a curricular structure that prepares students for professional careers in teaching, museum studies or other relevant occupations. Students receive a broad overview of the archaeology and art of this complex region, allowing them to develop particular research interests revolving around one or more of its ancient cultures. Joukowsky Institute faculty and students are from a wide range of countries and backgrounds –– and archaeological fieldwork and research at Brown reflects and builds on that multiplicity of perspectives. The institute seeks graduate students who will help to increase the program's diversity and who will further contribute to making this a more inclusive environment. Graduate students are encouraged to explore the numerous strong cognate departments at Brown (such as Anthropology, Classics, Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences, Egyptology and Assyriology, Engineering, History of Art and Architecture, and Religious Studies), as well as other resources in the area, such as the Rhode Island School of Design Museum and the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology, or academic exchange opportunities with nearby universities. Additional Resources Excellent library resources; graduate student research space and computing facilities in a dedicated building on Brown's College Green; active program of seminars, lectures and visiting scholars; facilitation of student fieldwork and travel interests; study collection of antiquities and coins; access to the holdings of the RISD Museum, adjacent to the Brown campus; proximity to other major museums on the East Coast.
