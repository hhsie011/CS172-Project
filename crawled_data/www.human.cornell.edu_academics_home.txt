All programs within the College combine theory with application to foster creative problem solving skills. The link between theory and application is supported by the content of the programs and by a number of off-campus study programs that a large portion of students in our college participate in. The research accomplishments of the faculty profoundly influence the delivery of all academic programs. Undergraduate The College offers undergraduate programs of study, that provide students with a pre-professional education within a liberal-arts based curriculum. The application of the curriculum to real world issues is highly valued, students can choose from a variety of experiential opportunities through which to apply their education. Students participate in off-campus study programs in New York City, Albany, Washington DC, or abroad, have meaningful opportunities to engage in research with faculty through independent and directed studies, honors theses or paid research assistance, and are deeply involved in community outreach and internship/externship experiences. Our counselors and advisors, as well as our college Career Exploration Center, help students make the most of these and other opportunities. The College welcomes transfer students as incoming sophomores and juniors. Graduate At the doctoral level, graduate education at Cornell occurs in fields of study, which span individual colleges and departments. Fields group faculty by common academic interest, ensuring that faculty and students across the university can share ideas and work together freely. Human Ecology faculty are members of several other graduate fields, and graduate faculty of other colleges are members of graduate fields associated with Human Ecology. This breadth of opportunity enhances graduate studies for all.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters.
