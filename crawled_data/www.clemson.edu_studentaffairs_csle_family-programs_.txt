Welcome to the Clemson Family and our very own website! Clemson provides an abundance of resources at your disposal to keep you engaged and informed. This Clemson Families website and the Division of Student Affairs website, two of such resources, are the gateways to a wealth of information related to student initiatives, volunteer opportunities, family events and student safety, to name a few. One of our newest resources and one that is every near and dear to our hearts is the Clemson Parent and Family Experience communications portal. If you are not yet receiving emails from this portal, please visit and set up your profile and preferences. Within Student Affairs, the Clemson Family Advisory Board (CFAB) partners with the Center for Student Leadership and Engagement to provide a holistic Clemson experience. We aim to help make the dash between Move-in Day and Graduation Day meaningful, intentional and rewarding. CFAB members, which are comprised of parents, grandparents and guardians of current Clemson students, are here to engage with, inform and support all families as they navigate the Clemson experience landscape. Without question, each of you plays a huge part in making Clemson University unique. As a testament, one-half of our family are Clemson alumni (Leona, 1989; Barbara, 2015; and Jewel, 2022). There is definitely something special in these hills! It has been a joy to witness our children's experiences and growth at Clemson. As we close, we encourage you to check out the various pages on this website to learn, stay connected and to get involved. And don't forget to follow us on social media! If you EVER have questions, please don't hesitate to send us an email at cufamilies@clemson.edu. Until we CU, GO TIGERS!
