As a rule, these mentors come from the areas aligned with the student's theoretical and practical interests as well as working languages. To identify potential mentors, we encourage the accepted and prospective students to consider faculty affiliated with the Program and also faculty in respective area studies departments and English. Occasionally, mentors may come from such departments and programs as Film & Media Studies or Philosophy. Identifying the potential mentors during the summer before the start of the program is strongly advisable. Required Courses The Master's degree is a nine and a half month program which includes ten (10) courses. The program begins in early September and ends mid June. COLT 100 Contemporary Literary Criticism and Theory (Fall) COLT 101 Topics in Comparative Literature (Winter) COLT 102 Tutorial, Intensive work with a faculty tutor on a comparative literature subject (Fall) COLT 103 Workshop in Critical Writing (Spring) COLT 105 Graduate Seminar (Winter) COLT 700 Responsible and Ethical Conduct of Research (Fall) 4 upper-level literature courses, distributed across humanities curriculum, relevant to the student's M.A. research, and approved by the Director of Graduate Studies. Required Projects The M.A. Essay Starting in the fall, the students begin their work toward the M. A. essay. It is a publishable academic-article-length piece of writing that is due in their third (spring) term and is based on the readings and theoretical explorations in the courses and the tutorial of the fall and winter terms. The students work in close collaboration with their mentors, the Director of Graduate Studies, and the instructor of COLT 103: "Workshop in Critical Writing". The length of the essay is 7,500-9,000 words, and the formatting should correspond to the guidelines in the MLA Handbook. COLT 103 is designed explicitly to assist the students with the writing process, peer review, and oral presentation practice. Required Projects Teaching and Research Development Students are expected to work for at one term as a teaching assistant (TA) in one of the lecture courses. Typically, the TA works for ten hours a week and is in charge of a discussion section, a shre of grading, and soeoffice hours, although this may vary. As many of our graduate students as possible are placed with introductory course COLT 001: Read the World in the fall term. Otherwise, placement is facilitated by the director of the Gradute Studies and may be available in humanities departments in other relevant units. Additional professional development will be proviced in a series of informal workshops throughout the year.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Comparative Literature Program Undergraduate About the Program Courses Courses Recommended For First Year Students Course Descriptions Major How to Apply Minor in Translation Studies Honors Thesis Program Thesis Timeline Past Theses Awards & Prizes Undergraduate Alumni Undergraduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Graduate Overview About the Program Current MA Students How to Apply Degree Requirements Courses Graduate Alumni Graduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Academic Achievement Award COLT MA Graduate Handbook News & Events Overview Annual Hoffman Lecture Annual Zantop Memorial Lecture People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
