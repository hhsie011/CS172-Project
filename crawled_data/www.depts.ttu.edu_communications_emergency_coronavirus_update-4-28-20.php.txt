This semester has presented unique challenges that we've had to overcome as a community and I am deeply appreciative of the dedication and work ethic you have demonstrated. We are all so proud that you are members of our Red Raider family. Today, I am excited to share that we received our allocation of funding through the federal CARES Act. We now have the grant application available and we are ready to begin awarding grants to students who qualify. The CARES Act provides funding for expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to COVID-19. You may request the funds that you need in these categories: Food Housing Course Materials Technology Healthcare Childcare Other Expenses (those that do not fit in the above categories) In the first round of funding, you may request up to $500 each month, for a total of $1,000. Following the successful submission of your application, you will be notified of your application status within seven days (via your @ttu.edu email address). Additional funding rounds will be determined at a later date. If you do not qualify for CARES Act emergency grants, but do have immediate needs, we encourage you to apply for funding through the Raider Relief Fund. For more information, assistance in determining your eligibility, or to submit your application, please visit the CARES Act resource page on the Student Financial Aid and Scholarships Office website. You can also contact them at (806) 742-3681 or finaid.advisor@ttu.edu with any questions. We are thankful to the federal government and our elected officials who worked to make these funds available to you. We look forward to receiving your grant application.
