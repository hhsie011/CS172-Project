How do I contact i2Verify? Website (including how-to guidance): https://i2verify.com/ Email: info@i2verify.com Live Toll Free Support: (888) 220-3457, available M-F 6AM to 4PM PST Note that email is not secure; instead of emailing sensitive documents, i2Verify’s website provides a file upload tool as a means to securely send documents to them. 2. What information can i2Verify provide? i2Verify can provide an employee’s: Current or most recent job title Dates of employment Base annual salary Employment status (Active/Inactive, Full/Part-Time, Perm/Temp) i2Verify cannot provide an employee’s: Job information prior to June 15, 2013 Job duties or reasons for separation Personal data, such as address Professional certifications Work schedule, attendance or timesheet information Amount of sick/vacation time off Wage/loss insurance forms Performance information Credentialing information (If seeking credentialing information, please contact the employee’s home department.) 3. If I am on a leave of absence, will my employment verification information indicate that I am on leave? If you are on a continuous leave of absence, or have not yet been returned from your leave of absence in Workday, your verification information will show an “on leave” status. Please work with your department to be returned from leave if you are no longer on an active leave of absence. 4. How often is the employment information in i2Verify's system updated? The information in i2Verify’s system is updated shortly after the close of every payroll cycle. In other words, changes to an employee’s status (e.g. timesheet approvals, retro payment, terminations) made in the course of any given pay cycle will appear in i2Verify’s system once that pay cycle closes. Refer to the Payroll and Workday Approval Deadline Calendar page for additional detail; the close of each payroll cycle is indicated on the calendar. Additionally, if your “on leave” status recently changed, and you urgently need an employment verification reflecting your new status, please contact i2Verify directly (see FAQ #1 for contact information) to explain your situation and request a “Custom Verification Letter.” i2Verify will then work with the ISC to confirm all status/employment changes. 5. Do I need an 'employer code' or 'salary key' for i2Verify to be able to process my request? No, i2Verify does not require an employer code or a salary key for verification requests or system registration. Please have your lender try contacting i2Verify directly – see FAQ #1 for contact information. 6. I see that i2Verify can provide me with either an employment verification report or an employment verification letter. Which should I choose? The choice you make is entirely dependent on the information you need. The differences between the contents of an employment verification report and an employment verification letter are summarized below. Employment Data Included in an Employment Verification Report? Included in an Employment Verification Letter? Original and Adjusted Hire Date YES YES Employment status* YES YES Separation date(s) YES YES Employment Type (full or part time) YES YES Company Letterhead YES YES Total Time Worked YES No Home address in Workday YES No Job and Wage History YES No List of Gross YTD totals per paycheck YES No Current Job title No YES FTE No YES Verifier Contact Information No YES Signature and Title of Authorized Official No YES * Status will show as “on leave” if the employee is actively on any type of approved leave of absence. 7. Can i2Verify complete MFTE and/or housing forms? Yes. i2Verify can complete forms sent to them via email, as well as those submitted to their secure file upload tool on their website. See FAQ #1 for contact information. 8. What should I do if the report I receive from i2Verify is incorrect or missing information? Contact i2Verify directly. See FAQ #1 for contact information. 9. Can the ISC provide me with employment verification (or re-verification) information verbally or electronically? The ISC does not provide verbal or electronic verifications or re-verifications. However, the following self-service resources are readily available as proof of current employment: i2Verify provides unlimited reports at no cost to University of Washington employees. See FAQ #1 for contact information. A year-to-date payslip (from the pay period immediately preceding the note date) can be printed/downloaded from Workday at any time. 10. Can the ISC provide me with employment verification information for situations related to COVID-19? Due to department policy, the ISC is unable to answer COVID-19 related inquiries (verbally or electronically). However, in response to the pandemic, Fannie Mae and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) have provided temporary guidelines for acceptable documents when verbal and electronic verifications are not available: A year-to-date payslip (from the pay period immediately preceding the note date) can be printed/downloaded from Workday at any time. Bank statements evidencing the payroll deposit from the pay period that immediately precedes the note date. 11. Does i2Verify comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)? Yes. i2Verify’s secure verification process meets the FCRA’s requirement of a permissible purpose1 for all employment verification requests. For income verification requests, verifiers must additionally certify to i2Verify that they have employee consent.2 1. “Permissible purpose” is an FCRA-compliant reason for requesting employment and/or income information. Common permissible purposes include: for the extension of credit, as part of an account review, for employment purposes, or when ordered by a court. A permissible purpose is required for each employment or income data request. 2. “Employee consent” is the employee’s authorization for access to their employment and/or income information. Employee consent can be in the form of an ink signature, an electronic signature or an i2Verify Permission Key. Verifiers must certify they have employee consent for each income verification request.
