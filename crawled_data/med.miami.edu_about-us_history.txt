The Miami VA is nationally recognized for several programs it conducts in partnership with the Miller School, including geriatric research, treatment of HIV/AIDS patients, spinal cord injury research, and substance abuse treatment. Bernard A. Roos, M.D., professor of geriatric medicine and chief academic officer of the Miami Jewish Home & Hospital for the Aged, was named a finalist in the health care professionals category. Diabetes Research Institute Makes Advances in Islet Cell Transplant - 2002 In August 2002, scientists at the Diabetes Research Institute successfully transplanted cultured islet cells into nine consecutive diabetic patients and achieved insulin-independence in all nine. The proven ability to isolate and maintain transplant-quality islets for this extended period of time means that diabetic patients who do not necessarily live near islet isolation centers now have as good a chance of being transplanted with the insulin-producing cells as those living nearby. "With this procedure we have been able to widen the window of time during which islets can be transplanted and make it easier for patients to get to the specialized centers where this type of procedure is available," explains Rodolfo Alejandro, M.D., professor of Medicine at the University of Miami School of Medicine and director of the Clinical Islet Transplant Program at the Diabetes Research Institute, where the trial was conducted. "The additional time also lets us better assess the cells that we are transplanting to determine their survivability and potency, as well as administer the pre-operative medications we have to give patients who are receiving the transplant." The Diabetes Research Institute is a comprehensive research institute dedicated exclusively to curing diabetes. Committed to advancing research to cure people now living with diabetes, the DRI focuses on the safe translation of basic research into advances for patients in the shortest possible time. The institute's pioneering work in the field of islet cell transplantation has made it an internationally recognized leader in biological replacement strategies and the testing facility of choice for both industry partners and scientists looking to fast-track their most promising discoveries. Schoninger Research Quadrangle Opens - 2002 In February 2001, the University of Miami received a gift of more than $5 million to support biomedical research at the School of Medicine from Bernard and Alexandria Schoninger, long-time residents of Bal Harbour, Florida. In recognition of the Schoningers' generosity, the University of Miami named in their honor the research quadrangle completed in February 2002. "This extraordinary gift to the School of Medicine creates a central focus for biomedical research at our growing medical center," says John G. Clarkson, M.D., senior vice president for medical affairs and dean of the Miller School. "While our outstanding faculty members continue to compete successfully for federal research funds, it is always heartening when philanthropically minded individuals invest in our research enterprise. We are very thankful for the Schoningers' generous gift." In addition to supporting biomedical research, the gift also provides for the creation of the Schoninger Pain Center at the University of Miami Hospital and Clinics. This new center will focus on pain management for patients suffering from acute pain associated with disease or injury. Medical School Institutes New Teaching Curriculum - 2001 In 2001, the Miller School instituted a new medical curriculum. Mark O'Connell, M.D., senior associate dean of medical education, describes it in his own words: "The new curriculum was developed based on three guiding principles: To integrate the basic sciences and the clinical sciences; to move towards problem-based, self-directed, interactive learning; and to introduce new content into the curriculum because the role of a physician is very different in the modern delivery system than it was 10-15 years ago, and definitely different than 30-40 years ago when most of the traditional medical curricula were designed. In our move toward active, adult, problem-based learning, we have designed our curriculum as a hybrid of methods and format. We start out the first semester with what we call 'core principles.' They are a number of short introductory courses to biomedical science. Then we begin 18 months of integrated organ systems study, in which we study the pathophysiology of clinical disorders. This segment of the curriculum includes many small group sessions and less emphasis on lectures. Finally, near the end of the second year, we move into a traditional problem-based learning mode. The students use clinical cases to generate their own learning objectives. The students have to figure out what they need to know, then they go and look it up and learn it on their own. They are broken up into groups of eight students. Faculty members participate in the groups, but they don't actively teach. Instead they facilitate the sessions and keep the process moving. We call this phase of the new curriculum the Transition Block since it closes out the classroom component of the students' education and is followed by the clinical clerkships for the next two years. This case-based clinical problem centered learning emulates the manner in which physicians learn for the rest of their lives." Donna E. Shalala Becomes Fifth President of the University of Miami - 2001 Former U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna E. Shalala was appointed the fifth President of the University of Miami in June 2001. With a distinguished record and more than 25 years of experience as an accomplished scholar, teacher, and administrator, President Shalala was the ideal person to succeed Edward T. Foote II to address the needs of the School of Medicine and lead the University into the new millennium. President Shalala is a professor of political science, epidemiology and public health and education. Prior to her eight-year position in the Clinton Cabinet, President Shalala was a prominent academician. She is a leading scholar on the political economy of state and local governments, and held tenured professorships at Columbia University, the City University of New York, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. She served as the president of Hunter College of CUNY from 1980-1987, and as chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison from 1987-1993. Batchelor Children's Research Institute Dedicated - 2001 The Batchelor Children’s Research Institute was dedicated on May 3, 2001. George Batchelor, an aviation pioneer and philanthropist, made a leadership donation of $10 million to create the institute, then pledged an additional $5 million at the dedication ceremony. One of the largest centers in the world devoted exclusively to research in children’s health, the Batchelor Children’s Research Institute includes 147,500 square feet dedicated to basic and clinical research. The School of Medicine expressed its deep gratitude as well as its condolences to the family of George Batchelor upon his death in July 2002. It is estimated that Batchelor contributed $100 million to South Florida charitable and public service organizations, including $15 million for the construction of the Batchelor Children’s Research Institute. Laurence Gardner, M.D., Appointed Vice Dean of the School of Medicine - 2000 In 2000 Laurence B. Gardner, M.D., was appointed to serve as vice dean of the School of Medicine, the first such appointment in the School's history. Dr. Gardner received his B.S. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1963 and his M.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1967. After completing his residency at the Massachusetts General Hospital and his fellowship in nephrology at the University of Pennsylvania, he joined the faculty at the University of Miami School of Medicine in 1974. He currently serves as the Kathleen and Stanley Glaser Professor and Chairman of the Department of Medicine. His particular interests include acid-base physiology and clinical disorders of electrolyte metabolism, as well as health policy. In March, 2003 Dr. Gardner was elected Chair of the Board of the National Board of Medical Examiners. He also assumed the role of President of the Association of Professors of Medicine on July 1, 2003. The Lois Pope LIFE Center Opens - 2000 The University of Miami School of Medicine, a leader in the multidisciplinary approach to spinal cord injury and neurological disorders, consolidated and expanded its efforts with the construction of the Lois Pope LIFE Center. Philanthropist Lois Pope and the State of Florida each provided $10 million to build the 115,000 square foot Lois Pope LIFE Center. Her gift is the largest private gift ever directed to research of spinal cord and nervous system injury. The Lois Pope LIFE Center serves as the hub of the medical school's neuroscience research efforts, including the work of The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis. Founded in 1985 by Barth Green, M.D. and football legend Nick Buoniconti, The Miami Project is a clinical and basic science research enterprise seeking the cure for paralysis. Research on Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke is also conducted in the Lois Pope LIFE Center. 1990s + – John K. Robinson, M.D., Dies - 1999 John K. Robinson, M.D., former associate dean for student affairs at the School of Medicine, died on April 2, 1999, at the age of 75. Dr. Robinson’s tenure as associate dean of student affairs began at the a time when medical education specialties were just evolving at the School of Medicine, such as admissions, curriculum, student counseling, and preparation for graduation and post-graduate training. Consequently, he wore many hats, ranging from admission interviews to counseling students. In recognition of Dr. Robinson’s dedication to students, the University of Miami Medical Alumni Association established the John K. Robinson Loyalty Fund in 1971. The fund provides loans to students in need of financial assistance to complete their medical degree. Dedication of Dewitt Daughtry Family Department of Surgery - 1998 Dewitt Daughtry, M.D. and his wife Lucille were honored at the dedication ceremony of the Dewitt Daughtry Family Department of Surgery in 1998. Dr. Daughtry arrived in Miami in 1948, and he was a pioneer of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery in Florida. In the early years of the medical school’s history, Dr. Daughtry volunteered as an unpaid, part-time instructor of the anatomy and physiology of the thoracic organs. Throughout his career he retained his voluntary teaching position at the medical school and made significant contributions to his field as well as to the institution. Today Dr. Daughtry holds the title of voluntary emeritus professor in the Department of Surgery. The Dewitt Daughtry Family Department of Surgery has 67 full-time surgeons, 157 voluntary faculty, 30 research faculty, and 109 residents and fellows. Programs and facilities include the Ryder Trauma Center, the UM/Jackson Memorial Burn Center, and organ transplantation programs. University of Miami International Health Center Opens - 1996 The University of Miami International Health Center (IHC) officially opened in October 1996, with the goal to establish UM/Jackson as the preferred U.S. institution for patients from abroad seeking medical care and as the leading resource for physicians and medical students looking for educational opportunities in the United States. The IHC was closely coordinated with the Harrington Medical Training Programs for Latin America. Building on the long tradition of success of the Harrington Programs, the IHC coordinated and supported educational activities for Latin American students and physicians, such as a centralized bureau of international speakers, post-graduate courses, enhancement of in-house training opportunities in all specialties, and the development of telemedicine capabilities for education and consultation. John G. Clarkson Appointed Senior Vice President for Medical Affairs and Dean - 1995 In 1995, John G. Clarkson, M.D., was selected to serve as senior vice president for medical affairs and dean of the School of Medicine. A well-respected, longstanding faculty member and chairman of the Department of Ophthalmology, Dr. Clarkson had a history of leadership at the medical school. Beginning after his graduation from Princeton, when he entered the School of Medicine as a student in 1964, to the present time, Dr. Clarkson has perpetuated the institution’s mission of patient care, education, research, and community service. Dr. Clarkson’s training included a fellowship in ophthalmic pathology and retinal and vitreous diseases at Wilmer Ophthalmological Institute of The Johns Hopkins University and Hospital. His special interest in disorders related to the retina and macula led to his expertise in the surgical removal of the epiretinal membrane. Prior to his appointment as dean, Dr. Clarkson was chairman of the Department of Ophthalmology, director of the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, and medical director of the Anne Bates Leach Eye Hospital. 40 Renowned Liver Transplant Specialist Dr. Andreas Tzakis Arrives - 1994 The arrival of Dr. Andreas Tzakis contributed to the growth of the School’s transplant program. Dr. Tzakis had gained renown in the early 1990s at the University of Pittsburgh, when he and a team of surgeons twice transplanted livers from baboons into humans. He also participated in the world’s first long-term successful islet cell transplantation and helped pioneer a technique for transplanting the intestine. Dr. Tzakis was drawn to the School of Medicine because few medical centers offered such a wide range of resources: a topnotch clinical liver unit, a well-established immunology lab, and a highly respected organ procurement program. Dr. Tzakis has performed more than 1,000 transplants since his arrival in 1994. Generalist Education in Medicine Program Established - 1993 During the 1993-94 academic year, the faculty formed a series of task forces under the guidance of Pantagiota Caralis, M.D. to develop recommendations and strategies for enhancing generalist education and career selection for School of Medicine graduates. Changes in the country’s health care delivery system strongly suggested a need for greater attention directed toward generalism and primary care in medical education. In 1994, the school established the Generalist Education in Medicine Steering Committee to guide the institution’s efforts in meeting educational goals. The committee included the dean, dean emeritus, deputy dean for medical education, deputy dean for clinical affairs, associate dean of community health, and the chairmen of the Departments of Medicine, Family Medicine and Community Health, Pediatrics, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and Obstetrics and Gynecology. Mark O’Connell, M.D. was appointed director of the Generalist Education in Medicine Programs. Association of American Medical Colleges Presents Outstanding Community Service Award - 1993 In 1993 the School of Medicine was selected to receive the first community service award from the Association of American Colleges in recognition of its commitment to medically underserved communities in South Florida, especially during the 1980s, and for the health care it provided in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew. All 126 U.S. medical schools are eligible for this award, and the three finalists in 1993 were the University of Miami, Johns Hopkins University, and the University of California at San Francisco. Ryder Trauma Center Opens - 1992 The Ryder Trauma Center is the largest, most comprehensive trauma center in the world. Opened in 1992, The Ryder Trauma Center provides resuscitation, emergency surgical intervention, diagnostic and medical treatment, and intensive care to Miami-Dade County's trauma victims. The center also features extensive research and education facilities, as well as administrative and ancillary support space. The only certified Level 1 trauma center in South Florida for adults and children, Ryder’s personnel and integrated resources are available at all hours. The facility is geared toward lowering the preventable death rate by speeding up the delivery of trauma care during the golden hour, the critical 60 minutes after an injury. Named in honor of Ryder Systems, Inc., a major corporate citizen of the South Florida community, the facility was made possible through the dedicated efforts of medical school faculty and the Public Health Trust. The Ryder Trauma Center accepts more than 3,300 admissions each year, nearly 1,000 of which arrive via Miami-Dade air rescue. Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center opens - 1992 Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center was established in 1973 and renamed in 1992, following a generous $27.5 million contribution from the Harcourt M. and Virginia W. Sylvester Foundation, Inc. The groundbreaking ceremony for this 117,500 square foot clinical facility – designed to meet the special physical and psychological needs of cancer patients – was held in 1989 and the new facility opened in 1992. Sylvester serves today as the hub for cancer-related research, diagnosis, and treatment at the University of Miami School of Medicine. Sylvester's priority is to better serve patients with complex medical needs. We apply a targeted, site-based approach to treating cancer, which means that dedicated, board-certified physicians with expertise researching and treating specific cancer sites oversee all aspects of patient care. More than 100,000 square feet of research space is currently in use by physicians and scientists studying the complex molecular functions of healthy and cancerous cells. The development of promising translational or "bench to bedside" research remains one of Sylvester's highest priorities. Sylvester physicians and scientists are currently engaged in more than 160 clinical investigations, having received nearly $40 million in research grants. To date, the Harcourt M. and Virginia W. Sylvester Foundation, Inc has given more than $40 million in grants to support Sylvester. All Sylvester physicians and scientists are on the faculty of the School of Medicine. Touch Research Institute Established - 1992 The Touch Research Institute (TRI) was formally established in 1992 by current director Tiffany Field, Ph.D., research professor in the Department of Pediatrics, through a start-up grant from Johnson & Johnson. The Touch Research Institute was the first center in the world dedicated solely to the study of touch, its application in science and medicine, and studies on the benefits of massage. In June 2002, Johnson & Johnson surprised Dr. Field with a tribute at Viscaya Museum and Gardens, honoring the 10th anniversary of the Touch Research Institute. Through her work at the TRI, based in the Department of Pediatrics and including other facilities around the world, Dr. Field has conducted studies that show the positive effects of massage on the health of premature infants, children with asthma, and HIV-positive babies, among others. R. Bunn Gautier Building Opens - 1991 The R. Bunn Gautier Building opened in the spring of 1991 and became the home of the Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. The building was named in honor of State Senator R. Bunn Gautier of Dade County, an important political advocate of bringing a medical school to Miami. In 1951, Senator Gautier prepared and introduced a bill that called for the state to pay, "the first accredited and approved medical school in the State of Florida and operated by a municipality or county of the state or by a non-profit organization -- established exclusively for educational purposes – a sum of $3,000 per student for up to 75 students per class." This bill allowed the University of Miami to receive the state support necessary to create the Medical School. University of Miami Creates Ear Institute - 1990 The University of Miami Ear Institute was established in 1990 with the recruitment of internationally renowned clinical and research faculty, including founding director Thomas Balkany, M.D., an alumnus of the University of Miami who received his undergraduate degree in 1968 and a medical degree from UM in 1972. Dr. Balkany returned to lead the Ear Institute and performed the first cochlear implant at UM/Jackson in 1990. Since the device was approved for adults in 1978 and children in 1990, advances in design and surgical techniques have reduced complications and expanded the conditions of deafness that succumb to artificial nerve stimulation. With the aid of a cochlear implant, many adults, teenagers, and children born profoundly deaf are able to understand spoken language and even enjoy music. 1980s + – The Center for Adult Development and Aging Created - 1989 The Center for Adult Development and Aging was created in 1989 to provide accurate information and assistance to older patients and their families. The center is dedicated to enhancing the quality of life of older citizens and conducting significant research pertaining to geriatric issues. Dr. Carl Eisdorfer, chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, played a major role in creating this program. Under his guidance, The Center for Adult Development and Aging gained national recognition. In particular, the center has been successful in the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's Disease, and physicians see thousands of patients with memory disorders. According to Dr. Eisdorfer, "Older people are pretty vulnerable to cognitive impairment. If you see 1,000 older people, 200 of them will have minor cognitive impairment." Milestones at the Transplant Program - 1986 The medical center's transplant program attained two significant milestones in 1986, with its first successful heart and liver transplants. In November 1986, Dr. Hooshang Bolooki, professor of surgery and chief adult cardiac surgeon, performed a heart transplant on a 27-year-old man. The procedure required the efforts of a comprehensive team of medical specialists, nurses, and other professionals and administrators. A team of specialists that included Dr. Joshua Miller, chief of the Division of Transplantation; Dr. Maureen Jonas, assistant professor of pediatrics; Dr. Claudio Oiticica, assistant professor of pediatric surgery; and Dolores Sutherland, R.N., performed a successful liver transplant on five-year-old Latoi Sainil. Today, more than 230 heart and liver transplants are performed on the medical campus each year. UM/Jackson Memorial Medical Center Ranked 16th in the Nation - 1986 In 1986 UM/Jackson Memorial Medical Center was ranked 16th in the nation (out of 7,000 hospitals) in The Best in Medicine. Regionally-recognized services included: Trauma Center, Spinal Cord Injury Center, Transplant Program, Center for Liver Diseases, Newborn Special Care Center, Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, UM/JM Burn Center, Center for Blood Diseases, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Pediatric Cardiology Center, Comprehensive Children's Kidney Center, and Rape Treatment Center. The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis Established - 1985 The concept of The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis was a longstanding dream of Dr. Barth Green, the Miller School of Medicine's chair of the Department of Neurological Surgery and founder of the Miami Project. When his son Marc was paralyzed due to a football injury in 1985, Miami Dolphin's football legend Nick Buoniconti dedicated himself to helping his son and others like him walk again. To confirm his commitment, Buoniconti joined Dr. Green to establish The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, a clinical and basic science research enterprise seeking the cure for paralysis. Researchers at the Miami Project found the first direct evidence of successful regeneration of adult human central nervous system tissue. Marc, his parents, and many friends, have raised more than $100 million to support research. The program is now housed in The Lois Pope LIFE Center at the School of Medicine, which opened in October 2000. Maternal Child Care Tower Established for Mothers and Children - 1984 In 1984, Jackson Memorial Hospital opened the new seven-story Maternal Child Care Tower, exclusively dedicated to the care of mothers and children. This building houses a state-of-the-art neonatal intensive care unit and an expanded nursery. Simultaneously, a large, adjacent area was renovated in the hospital's Central Building to accommodate a step-down unit for infants who no longer required intensive care. The entire unit provided space for 66 ICU and 60 intermediate care beds with high-tech equipment and designated areas for processing and evaluating X-rays. Specialized neonatal and pediatric clinical faculty members were recruited to treat the constantly increasing number of infants requiring "step-down" care resulting from improved survival rates of extremely premature infants. New Veterans Administration Research and Education Building Opens - 1983 A new Veterans Administration Research and Education Building opened in 1983, helping to relieve the serious space shortage created by the explosion in research facilities on campus. After World War II, the VA health care system was reorganized. Over the years, the program flourished, particularly in Miami, which subsequently led to establishment of the new facility. Most of the Miller School of Medicine's clinical departments offer services at the VA, and a number of basic science departments include faculty with joint appointments at the VA. Many factors have contributed to this successful affiliation. According to Dean Clarkson, "The relationship between the two institutions has allowed for the joint recruitment of absolutely superb clinician-scientists, who not only conduct high-quality research, but are responsible for the excellent clinical care provided at the VA hospital." The 'Alamo,' Miami's First Hospital, Becomes Centerpiece of the Medical Center - 1982 The Alamo, the original Miami Hospital, was moved to the center of the School of Medicine campus and restored to serve as an information and museum facility. Built in 1917 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, the 565-ton building was moved 475 feet and developed into a park-like setting in the center of the medical campus. Volunteers raised a total of $70,000 to match a grant of $100,000 to pay for the relocation, which was prompted by the construction of the Maternal Child Care Tower. The Alamo was dedicated in its new location on November 22, 1982. The Ronald McDonald House Dedicated - 1982 On August 15, 1982, the Ronald McDonald House was built to provide a temporary home for families of seriously ill children treated at the University of Miami School of Medicine. A 28-room structure, this special facility includes kitchens, laundry rooms, and recreation areas and was modeled after similar buildings in Philadelphia, Atlanta, and 20 additional cities in the United States. Since its opening, the Ronald McDonald House has provided temporary lodging for over 10,000 families of critically ill children. Guests come from South Florida, the Caribbean, Central and South America, Russia, Israel, and many other places from around the world. On November 13, 2002, the Ronald McDonald House celebrated its 20th anniversary with a grand renovation and re-dedication ceremony. Bernard J. Fogel, M.D., Named Dean of the School of Medicine - 1982 After holding the position on an acting basis from the time of Dean Papper's retirement, Dr. Bernard J. Fogel was officially named vice president for medical affairs and dean of the medical school by President Foote and the Board of Trustees on August 30, 1982. A school of Medicine alumnus, house officer, young faculty member, and important figure in the administration for almost 25 years, Dr. Fogel brought a unique perspective to the medical center. Prior to his appointment as dean, he served as co-director of the neonatal nursery and director of the Birth Deficit Center at Jackson Memorial Hospital, associate dean for curricular affairs, associate dean for medical education, admissions, and research, and assistant vice president for medical affairs. His steady relationship with the community and with the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Medical Center has been instrumental in establishing the school's international reputation. Dr. Fogel's term as dean lasted more than 14 years until his retirement in 1995. He is dean emeritus and remains an important presence on the medical school campus. Chancellor Tad Foote said, "His contributions would include his remarkable capacity for empathy, and he truly loves this medical school and all it stands for in terms of human life and the capacity of human beings to make life better for others." Edward 'Tad' Foote II Appointed Fourth President of the University of Miami - 1981 Several changes in leadership occurred at the University of Miami and the School of Medicine in the early 1980s. Henry King Stanford, president of the University, guided the institution to excellence before retiring on June 1, 1980. After 12 years of superb direction, Dr. Emanuel E. Papper, vice president for medical affairs and dean of the School of Medicine, announced his retirement in June 1981. On March 23, 1981, the University's Board of Trustees announced the appointment of Edward 'Tad' Foote II as the fourth president. Former dean of the School of Law at Washington University and special advisor to the Chancellor and Board of Trustees of that prestigious institution, President Foote had the experience and leadership necessary to enable the University to continue its tradition of excellence. President Foote's tenure spanned two full decades until he announced his retirement in 2000. 1970s + – Center for Research in Medical Education Opens - 1979 The construction for what is now known as the Center for Research in Medical Education (CRME) began in 1978, and the building officially opened in 1979. Today, this comprehensive center is a unique laboratory for the application of advanced technology to medical education for medical students, physicians, physician assistants, nurses, and paramedic/firefighters. The center has full facilities for simulation and computer design, engineering, production, and manufacturing. It houses the Medical Training and Simulation Laboratory, which includes a high technology auditorium, a self-learning laboratory, a standardized patient training area, an actual fire rescue vehicle, a car for extrication of trauma victims, a hazardous materials decontamination shower, and a mock-up emergency department. Each year, more than 6,000 learners, including thousands of paramedics who answer 911 calls for millions of residents throughout Florida, are trained through the center’s Division of Emergency Medical Skills Training. As an American Heart Association Community Training Center, the CRME offers courses in Basic Life Support, Advanced Cardiac Life Support, and Pediatric Advanced Life Support. First Woman Chairs Medical School Department of Radiology - 1978 Dr. Catherine Anne Poole became the first woman in the United States to chair a medical school department of radiology when she was named to that position at the University of Miami School of Medicine in 1978. A specialist in pediatric radiology, Dr. Poole came to the University of Miami in 1963 after fellowships at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and Children’s Hospital Medical Center in Boston. Dr. Poole set out to integrate radiology more extensively into medical education at all levels, to ultimately help improve patient care, cost effectiveness, and reduction in radiation exposure. “When I first started with the school, pediatric radiology was non-existent as a separate specialty. Infants and children were second-class citizens in a large, adult-oriented radiology department,” stated Dr. Poole in 1978. “Now we have three full-time faculty members, in addition to myself, devoted exclusively to pediatric radiology. It is now a major division.” University of Miami School of Medicine/Jackson Memorial Medical Center Complex Becomes Largest Medical Center in the Southeast - 1975 By 1975, the University of Miami School of Medicine/Jackson Memorial Medical Center had grown to become the largest of its kind in the southeast and the fifth largest in the nation. The school was the 10th largest medical school in the nation with the 12th largest faculty. At the end of the 1974-75 school year, there were 527 full-time, 32 adjunct full-time, 84 part-time, 110 adjunct part-time, and 1,082 voluntary faculty members. Students in the fall of 1975 numbered 530 studying for the M.D. degree and 56 in the M.D./Ph.D. program. Between 1956 and 1974, the school graduated 1,251 physicians, ninety-four percent of whom were Floridians. 407 remained in Florida to practice and 454 went to other southern states. The School of Medicine had grown steadily in size with virtually no endowment, relatively small but significant private support, the state subsidy for teaching undergraduates, and federal funding. Comprehensive Cancer Center Established at the University of Miami School of Medicine - 1973 In 1973, the Comprehensive Cancer Center for the State of Florida was established at the School of Medicine. It was named the Papanicolaou Comprehensive Cancer Center in 1984. It was subsequently renamed Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center in 1986, following a generous $32.5 million dollar contribution from the Harcourt M. and Virginia W. Sylvester Foundation to strengthen the University of Miami School of Medicine’s fight against cancer. A groundbreaking ceremony for the clinical facility was held on May 17, 1989, and the building opened in June 1992. The largest outpatient cancer treatment facility in the southeastern United States, this 117,500 square-foot center is designed to meet the special physical and psychological needs of cancer patients by offering a multi-disciplinary approach to the detection, diagnosis, research, and treatment of cancer. Each of Sylvester’s more than 200 physicians was on the faculty of the School of Medicine. Over the years, the center has been a leader in the search for a cancer cure through more than 270 research trials funded in part by more than $38 million in annual research grants. More than 100,000 square feet of research space are used by researchers studying the complex molecular functions of cells. Louis Calder Memorial Library Dedicated - 1972 The Louis Calder Memorial Library was completed and dedicated on March 19, 1972. A three-story building with more than 54,000 square feet of floor space and capacity for 125,000 volumes, the medical library was the culmination of a 20-year dream. Prior to the opening of Calder Library, half the University’s medical library had been housed in a converted, quarter-century old servants’ dormitory adjacent to the historic Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables, while the other half of the library’s holdings were in the Woodard Building at Jackson Memorial Hospital. Funding for the library came from matching grants of $1.5 million from the Louis Calder Foundation of New York City and $1.1 million from the Public Health Service, Department of Health, Education and Welfare, under the Health Professions Manpower Act of 1965. This complex grant proposal was submitted in 1968 and approved in 1970. Designed by Steward/Skinner Associates jointly with Little/Lair/Pilkington, the building was called the “most beautiful medical library of its time.” Ph.D./M.D. Program Established at the School of Medicine - 1971 The innovative Ph.D./M.D. Program was the brainchild of Dr. William J. Harrington, chairman of the Department of Medicine. It was designed for individuals who had already completed the Ph.D. with a science concentration and wanted to achieve an M.D. degree as well. Dr. William Whelan was the first director of this unique program. Launched in 1971, the program opened with 20 students from a pool of 1,050 applicants. Their background in biological, physical, mathematical, and engineering disciplines provided these students with much of the information that is typically taught during the first two years of medical sciences. Accordingly, a curriculum was designed that allowed them to gain an M.D. degree in two instead of the customary four years. The Ph.D./M.D. program was in existence at the medical school until the late 1980s. The Mailman Center for Child Development and Debbie Institute Opens - 1971 New buildings and facilities enhanced the reputation of the School of Medicine and created more opportunities for training, patient care and research. In 1971 the Mailman Center for Child Development became operational. Built at a cost of about $8 million, it consists of a nine-story tower connected by a covered walkway at the second level to the two-story Debbie Institute. The Mailman Center was the first facility of its kind in Florida and one of 19 in the nation at the time. The Mailmans made their contribution to the center as a tribute to Abraham Mailman’s granddaughter, Debbie Segal, who had cerebral palsy. The Debbie Institute is named for her. Dade County leased four and one-half acres of land to the University for the Mailman Center. Full-time School of Medicine faculty members with a strong support staff teach and work in the fields of psychology, social work, pediatrics, nursing, speech and hearing, occupational therapy, physical therapy, education, law, nutrition, and physical education. 1960s + – Emanuel Papper M.D., Becomes Seventh Dean of the Medical School - 1969 In 1969, Emanuel Papper, M.D., was recruited from Columbia University, where he had spent 21 years, to become vice-president for medical affairs and dean of the School of Medicine. A world-renowned authority in the fields of anesthesiology and medical education, Dr. Papper brought vision and leadership to a young medical school. In his memoirs, he writes, "Among the concepts I absorbed was that the school was young by any standard at age 17. The situation was one of marked contrast for me after moving to Miami from New York and the second oldest medical school in the country (Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons)." Dr. Papper served as dean for 12 years and was instrumental in the growth and development of the school during the 1970s. During his tenure, the school made important strides in research, medical education, and patient care. He was named dean emeritus and served as an advisor to the Department of Anesthesiology and the School of Medicine until his death in December 2002. Dr. Papper will long be remembered by the medical school community for his legacy of excellence and intellectual endeavor. Drs. William Cleveland, William Brown, and Bernard Fogel Perform First Successful Thymus Transplant - 1967 In 1967, a six-week-old infant was referred to Dr. William Cleveland because of hypocalcemia, ultimately shown to be hypoparathyroidism. The patient was diagnosed with DiGeorge Syndrome, which includes the absence of the thymus. Dr. H.E.M. Kay in London, who had obtained thymic tissue from fetuses, agreed to send a specimen, which ultimately arrived via British Overseas Airway Corporation in a flask of cold saline. Dr. Fogel met the plane at 1 a.m., and the tissue was implanted in the infant’s rectus abdominus muscle by Dr. William Brown. There was immediate evidence of response, and the infant was later shown to have immunologic function restored. News about the thymus transplant was widely publicized in periodicals and newspapers, including a major story in The New York Times. School of Medicine Acquires Sewell Hall - 1965 In 1932, the University of Miami acquired Sewell Hall (and three surrounding acres), also known as Halissee Hall, originally built by John Sewell in 1914 for his pioneer family. This historic building, which now houses administrative offices, is emblematic of the growth of the medical school. Halissee Hall is one of the most important structures in Miami, both historically and architecturally. John Sewell was responsible for the planning and construction of Henry Flagler’s railroad in South Florida, and he and his brother were among the most influential citizens in the early days of the City of Miami. Sewell placed a plaque on his home that read: Halissee Hall, erected by John Sewell. Construction began July 20, 1913, on his 45th birthday. Hallisee — Seminole Indian name for “new moon.” University of Miami Purchases National Children’s Cardiac Hospital - 1965 The National Children’s Cardiac Hospital was originally established for the care of children with rheumatic heart disease and was supported by donations from chapters of fundraising organizations. It was first located in a rented house in Miami Beach and, in 1941, was moved to the corner of Flagler Street and LeJeune Road. In 1960, the facility was relocated to the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Medical Center. It was sold to the University of Miami for $10 in 1965 and merged with the University of Miami Hospitals and Clinics. Dr. Frank Hernandez, appointed director in 1951, maintained outpatient clinics for cardiology. He remained director of the Division of Cardiology until 1973. Among the facility’s many supporters, Mr. Richard Berenson was particularly magnanimous, serving as chair of the Board from 1961-67. Dr. William Harrington Becomes Chairman of the School of Medicine and Develops Medical Training Programs for Latin America - 1964 Dr. William Harrington, whose lifelong research in blood diseases had received international acclaim, arrived in Miami in 1964 to become Chairman of the Department of Medicine. Dr. Harrington believed that medical students should be exposed early to their responsibilities for education and research as well as patient care, and said, “You shouldn’t be in this business if you don’t treat patients and seek new knowledge.” Dr. Harrington developed the Medical Training Programs for Latin America, to train select physicians and students from Latin America, who then returned to improve medicine in their countries and influence their medical communities through education and leadership. The Medical Training Programs for Latin America also gave outstanding students the opportunity to attend the School of Medicine for limited periods. Many post-graduate courses were organized in important cities in Latin America; in addition, numerous faculty members from the School of Medicine became visiting professors in Latin America. Bascom Palmer Eye Institute Opens - 1962 Although ophthalmologist Dr. Bascom Headon Palmer, a co-founder of the University of Miami School of Medicine, dreamed of establishing a Miami clinic specializing in ophthalmic disorders and research, it is unlikely he envisioned anything comparable to the institution that bears his name today. In fact, the idea of the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute was a long way off when Dr. Palmer died in 1954. Nevertheless, it was through Dr. Palmer’s efforts, in concert with the Miami Lighthouse for the Blind, that funding was generated to buy the land and construct the facility dedicated in his honor as the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute on January 21, 1962. Today, the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute is considered one of the world’s premier training centers for ophthalmologists as well as a preeminent ophthalmic center, consistently ranked as one of the top two eye hospitals in the annual U.S. News & World Report “America’s Best Hospitals” issue. Office of International Medical Education Opens - 1961 To help exiled Cuban physicians pass the examination for certification required by the Educational Council for Foreign Medical Graduates, the school’s Department of Medicine created a post-graduate refresher course. This effort helped hundreds of Cuban doctors obtain their licenses to practice medicine and helped a younger generation begin their post-graduate training. In the early 1960s, Dr. Hayden Nicholson asked Dr. Rafael Penalver, formerly of the University of Havana, to direct this program, which eventually became known as the Office of International Medical Education. A couple of years later, Dr. William J. Harrington created the Medical Training Programs for Latin America, to train select physicians and students from Latin America, who would then return home to improve medicine in their countries. Over the years, the program trained thousands of physicians from Cuba and more than 60 other countries, including Vietnam and Cambodia. First School of Medicine Building Houses Research and Education - 1960 In the early 1960s, the School of Medicine continued to grow in size and complexity as it added training, research, service programs, and facilities. There were 185 full-time faculty members and approximately 500 volunteer clinical instructors, a Ph.D. program in the basic sciences, and more than 200 research projects supported by $4 million dollars in grant support. The first university-owned building, initially named the Medical Research Building, was a five-story structure created specifically for medical education and research. Prior to its opening in 1960, pre-clinical departments, as well as medical education, operated in the temporary servants’ quarters at the Biltmore Hotel where they were began in 1952. The building has since been renamed as the Kathleen and Stanley Glaser Medical Research Building. 1950s + – The University of Miami Board of Trustees and President Pearson Establish the Council of the University of Miami School of Medicine - 1959 The University of Miami Board of Trustees and President Jay F. Pearson established the Council of the University of Miami School of Medicine in 1959 to develop ideas and generate support for the construction of a major medical center. Twenty prominent citizens were on the council, including Chair Hoke Maroon, Vice-Chairman R. Bunn Gautier, and Dr. Milton Coplan, Secretary. Council members exchanged ideas and consulted with developers to create a major medical complex. The council adjourned in late 1962 when institutional leadership, including University trustees and School of Medicine administration, assumed full control of the development of school policy and the construction of buildings. Governor Leroy Collins Announces that Howard Hughes Will Help Fund Major Research Center - 1956 On January 10, 1956, Florida Governor Leroy Collins announced that Howard Hughes, the enigmatic industrialist-financier, would help fund a major medical research center in South Florida in association with the University of Miami. Mr. Hughes agreed to establish an institute for the study of all diseases except cancer, and The Hughes Organization paid for several phases of research, including salaries and retirement. First Medical School Class Graduates and School of Medicine is Fully Accredited - 1956 A few weeks before the first graduation ceremony, the American Medical Association and American Association of Medical Colleges issued formal accreditation for the School of Medicine. In June 1956, 26 new doctors (23 men and three women—Drs. Margaret Crawford, Kathleen Everitt, and Elaine Ross) graduated during ceremonies at Dinner Key Auditorium in Coconut Grove. Some highly respected practitioners were part of the first graduating class, including Norman Kenyon, M.D., a distinguished Miami surgeon, Russ Forlaw, M.D., a past- treasurer of the Florida Medical Association, and Ken Kiehl, M.D., a former member of the board of governors of the Florida Medical Association The graduates dispersed to 12 hospitals in seven states and the District of Columbia for internships and residencies, with the majority (14) joining the staff of three Florida hospitals. Clinical Training Begins at Veterans Administration Hospital and Jackson Memorial Hospital - 1954 Students of the School of Medicine began clinical training in 1954 in the old Veterans Administration Hospital in Coral Gables and in Dade County’s Jackson Memorial Hospital on 10th Avenue. Training continued in the School’s first unit, the Outpatient Clinic, constructed by Dade County near Jackson in 1955, under the direction of Dr. John K. Robinson. Last year, the School of Medicine’s clinical faculty physicians treated more than a million patients in primary care and various specialties. Clinical facilities are located at Jackson Memorial Hospital, the Miami Veterans’ Administration Medical Center, five primary care centers throughout Miami-Dade County, and a half-dozen area hospitals. The School of Medicine faculty also represents nearly every nation, discipline and specialty, from ophthalmology and pediatrics to kidney disease and cancer, ensuring that every patient receives the most effective treatment possible. University of Miami and Dade County Sign Formal Agreement Designating Jackson Memorial Hospital as the Teaching Hospital of the University of Miami School of Medicine - 1952 Dr. Bowman Foster Ashe and Florida State Senator R. Bunn Gautier gained permission from Dade County for the University to use the facilities at Jackson Memorial Hospital, a local governmental facility, in return for caring for the hospital's indigent patients. To meet one of the conditions for accreditation, the medical school was granted authority to appoint the teaching and medical personnel of Jackson Memorial Hospital. The University of Miami and Dade County signed a formal agreement in 1952 designating Jackson Memorial Hospital as the teaching hospital of the University of Miami School of Medicine. The document that outlined the relationship stated the following: "The Dade County Commission agrees to operate Jackson Memorial Hospital, to maintain all costs in the hospital incident to its operation, and to supply hospitalization for the indigent sick of the county as well as for such other sick as may present themselves for medical care at their own expense. The University of Miami through their School of Medicine will provide through its faculty all medical teaching in the hospital, and members of its faculty will provide training and care." School of Medicine Holds First Classes at Biltmore Hotel - 1952 Bowman Foster Ashe, the first President of the University of Miami, brought the dream of a medical school at the University of Miami closer to fruition on August 21, 1951. He persuaded the Veterans Administration to permit the University of Miami to lease the service and supply facility, formerly known as the servants' quarters at the Biltmore Hotel, to serve as a temporary medical school building. This would function as the primary teaching site for the University's medical students until 1969. President Ashe was described by many as a visionary. He had the foresight to recognize the great potential of the community and the need for a medical school to train physicians who would support this community through outstanding medical care and services. Dr. Ashe lived to see his dream come true when the medical school opened at the Biltmore in the fall of 1952, just months before his death on December 16, 1952. School of Medicine Admits First Class - 1952 On September 22, 1952, 28 courageous students from Florida (26 men and 2 women) were selected from 500 applicants to make up the first class of the University of Miami School of Medicine. They were greeted by Dr. Homer F. Marsh, associate dean, and a faculty of five: three anatomists - Dr. Frederick Garrett, Dr. R.T. Hill, and George H. Paff - and two biochemists - Dr. John McAnnally and Dr. George Tershahovec. facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Research Gate Resources News Admissions and Education Research MyUM UM Network Alumni Association Giving Wellness Center Employment University of Miami Visit Campus Highlights Transportation & Parking UHealth Bascom Palmer Eye Institute Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center Emergency Information | Privacy Statement & Legal Notices © 2022 University of Miami.
