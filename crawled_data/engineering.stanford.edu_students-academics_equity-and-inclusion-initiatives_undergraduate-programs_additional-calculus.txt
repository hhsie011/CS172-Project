The mission of ACE is to provide our students, particularly those from under-resourced and/or minoritized backgrounds, with the opportunities and support to succeed in their course and in their major. ACE sections, instruction, and the ACE Course Assistants (CA’s) are intentional about fostering environments based on equity, purposeful engagement, and inclusive teaching practices. Students selected to participate in ACE are those whose application demonstrates the most significant need or have not had access to institutional resources, exposure, or instruction related to Calculus and/or Computer Science. Enrolling in ACE Courses Undergraduate students participating in ACE are required to attend an additional weekly section and must enroll in their selected course for 1 additional unit. ACE participants also receive access to additional exam review sessions, individual tutoring, and other study resources. We accept applications from all students who believe they may benefit from participating in small active-learning sessions led by a highly trained graduate student. Learn more and apply to enroll in Spring Quarter 2022 ACE Courses Questions? Inquiries regarding logistics, acceptance, advising, and course scheduling, may be directed to Betty Aynalem (she/her) at bettya@stanford.edu Inquiries regarding the ACE Course Assistant position may be directed to Jae Chung (he/him) at chungjae@stanford.edu Become an ACE Course Assistant Graduate students in the School of Engineering are invited to apply to work as ACE Course Assistants (CA). ACE CAs lead weekly sections to support large courses in Math, Computer Science, and Computational and Mathematical Engineering. Learn More and Apply ACE Course List ACE course offerings change every quarter. Though there are some courses that are offered every quarter, most courses are only offered in specific quarters. ACE courses may also be cancelled at the start of the quarter if interest and enrollment is lower than desired.
