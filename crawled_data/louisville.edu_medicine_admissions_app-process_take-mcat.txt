FAQ Contact MCAT ULSOM MCAT policy: The ULSOM accepts the most recent score, and will not accept any MCAT scores older than two years old. Applications from students with pending MCAT scores are accepted and reviewed. Secondary applications may be extended to those without MCAT scores and will be based on available application information. Applicants should not delay applying due solely to an unavailable MCAT score. However, applicants must have an MCAT score before being considered for an interview. When to take the MCAT: The MCAT should preferably be taken during the second semester of the applicant's junior year, or the summer term immediately thereafter. In no case should it be postponed later than the fall of the year prior to the one in which the applicant intends to enter medical school. The MCAT should not be attempted before the major basic science requirements are completed. MCAT information may be obtained from the applicant's premedical advisory personnel or by going online to the MCAT web site. ULSOM MCAT Averages: The 2021 entering ULSOM Class average for the MCAT is a 507 total score. MCAT averages for previous years can be found on the ULSOM student profile page. MCAT: The MCAT has an added emphasis on the social and behavioral sciences, scientific inquiry and reasoning skills, and introductory biochemistry. To learn more about the exam, go to MCAT web site. All applicants must take the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT), with the exception of the University of Louisville School of Dentistry students applying for the Advanced Education Program in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. The Dental Admissions Test (DAT) will be considered in lieu of the MCAT for these applicants Tweet Medical Admissions 323 East Chestnut St. University of Louisville Louisville, KY 40202 Office Hours M-F 8:00 am to 5:00 pm Phone View contact information for the School of Medicine.
