Join your fellow Columbia alumni as we usher in the season with a Holiday Happy Hour on Thursday, December 2. Recommended attire is business casual—but your holiday sweaters are strongly encouraged. We will gather from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. in Royal Oak at Bigalora Wood-Fired Cucina, a popular Italian eatery offering Neapolitan wood-fired pizzas. We will provide complimentary pizza, including vegetarian and gluten-free varieties. You can order and purchase your own drinks from the servers. Bigalora has a nice selection of draft and bottled beers, wine, cocktails, and soft drinks.
