As part of this mission, the Office of International Affairs (OIA) works to expand the global footprint of the University by integrating international education, scholarship, and engagement with global issues, and by strengthening intercultural understanding for students, faculty, staff, and the broader community. Housed within the beautifully designed International Cultural Center (ICC), the OIA consists of the following divisions: International Research and Development, International Student and Scholar Services, International Relations, Study Abroad, K-12 Global Education Outreach, Center for Global Communication, and International Center for Arid and Semiarid Land Studies. History Built in 1996, the International Cultural Center (ICC) is a significant service center and is Texas Tech University's signature statement of its commitment to international education. Through the divisions of the OIA, it provides a continual series of conferences, lectures, art exhibitions, and performances as well as services to faculty, staff, students, and the local community. More than 35,000 people are served through the center each year. The Award of Merit from the American Institute of Architects was awarded to the architects for the ICC design.When visiting the ICC, you will notice the 12 foot stainless steel globe just west of the building. Inside, the building is equally beautiful. The Hall of Nations is a rotunda and features flags of nations of the world and a terrazzo floor representing the continents, oceans and seas of the world. A color mural, The Peoples of the World , and sepia murals of education and the arid lands mission of the University can be seen in the halls and gallery outside the Hall of Nations. Our World Room is featured in the center of the building and exhibits a six-foot geo-physical circulating globe by Rand McNally. Photographic and art exhibits can be viewed in both the east and west galleries and on the walls encircling the globe in the Our World Room.
