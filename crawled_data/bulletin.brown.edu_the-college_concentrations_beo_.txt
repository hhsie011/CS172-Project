BEO focuses on the formation, growth, and organization of new ventures, innovation in commercial applications, financial markets and the marketplace, and management and organizational theory. Concentrators seek to understand the basic principles, approaches and vocabulary relevant to the study of entrepreneurship from the disciplines of economics, organizational sociology and engineering. Building on this multidisciplinary base, students develop specialized expertise in one of the three disciplinary approaches, with special emphasis on critical reasoning and quantitative research methods. In senior year capstone projects, students apply and integrate multi-disciplinary learning by working in groups on real world projects, including the creation of new ventures. BEO students interested in the theory and practice of addressing social challenges might consider the Engaged Scholars Program. The Business, Entrepreneurship, and Organizations concentration is open only to students admitted in the fall of 2019 or prior. The three tracks of the concentration are as follows: Business Economics Organizational Studies Entrepreneurship and Technology Management Upon completion of all concentration requirements, students receive the Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) degree in Business, Entrepreneurship and Organizations.
