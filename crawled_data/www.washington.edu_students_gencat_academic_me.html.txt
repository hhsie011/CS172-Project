Home Home Students Parents Faculty & Staff Alumni College of Engineering Mechanical Engineering 143 Mechanical Engineering Building 206-543-5090 Website Faculty Website merecept@uw.edu Mechanical engineering is one of the broadest and oldest of the engineering disciplines and therefore provides some of the strongest interdisciplinary opportunities in the engineering profession. Power utilization (and power generation) is often used to describe the focus of mechanical engineering. Within this focus are such diverse topics as thermodynamics, heat transfer, fluid mechanics, machine design, mechanics of materials, manufacturing, stress analysis, system dynamics, numerical modeling, vibrations, turbomachinery, combustion, heating, ventilating, and air conditioning. Degrees in mechanical engineering open doors to careers not only in the engineering profession but also in business, law, medicine, finance, and other non-technical professions.

The department's goal is success for its graduates in industry, research, and academic careers by virtue of skills and attributes learned in the program. Graduates succeed in their professional and academic positions by: using fundamental science and analysis to solve engineering problems, successfully executing engineering designs, and performing effectively in design teams, in the use of management tools, and through effective oral, written, and graphical communication. Contribution to Society. Graduates should be critical thinkers in the tradition of the broad liberal arts education. They succeed in this goal by being able to: think critically, in the sense of broadly educated individuals (i.e., be informed evaluators/consumers of information), perform independent, informed analysis on issues inside and outside of technology, and continue lifelong learning. The BSME program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, 111 Market Place, Suite 1050, Baltimore, MD 21202-4012, telephone: (410) 347-7700, and the department has adopted the following student outcomes: An ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering An ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data An ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability An ability to function on multi-disciplinary teams An ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems An understanding of professional and ethical responsibilities An ability to communicate effectively The broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context A recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in, life-long learning Knowledge of contemporary issues An ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice Each student's success is measured by demonstration of the following learning outcomes: Ability to apply this knowledge to the formulation and solution of mechanical engineering problems Ability to design thermal and mechanical components to achieve a desired goal. Ability to develop, conduct, and analyze experiments or tests that may aid in this design process. An understanding of the necessary professional abilities of a practicing engineer including ethical conduct, teamwork in the pursuit of a goal, and effective communication Ability to conduct computer-based design and analysis in engineering applications Exposure to a general education program that aids in the understanding of and increases the appreciation for the "non-technical" world Realization of the business environment in which engineering is practiced.
