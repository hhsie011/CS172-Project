Currently, the field of healthcare is primarily focused on late stage disease including treatments applied relatively late with suboptimal health outcomes. However, continued Stanford advancements in biology and technology are leading to the potential to understand disease risk, detect disease early and enable preventative interventions. The new center PHIND will develop, test and disseminate the next generation of healthcare strategies and mechanisms focused on precision health through integrating diagnostic information collected from multiple sources both on the body, and in one’s home. It will also study the fundamental biology underlying early transitions from health to disease and the biomarkers (molecules) of health and early disease. The new center aims to fundamentally revolutionize healthcare leading to better and more productive lives for individuals. The center is directed by Dr. Garry Gold, Professor of Radiology.
