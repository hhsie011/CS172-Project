While these programs overlap to some extent, they differ in how society interacts with the natural environment: Geography examines how location and scale affect human behavior within urban, rural, and natural environments, while Environment & Society explores how humans both affect and are affected by changes in the natural environment. Students may double major in Geography and Environment & Society; with a maximum of eleven semester hours allowed to overlap. The Department also offers Pathways programs from both the Geography major and the Environment & Society major to the Applied Master’s program in Geography Information Science. Geographers are concerned with mapping how changes to the landscape, vegetation, animals, and climate impact where humans live, socialize, work, trade, and form cultural and nationalist identities. They examine industry, environmental health, boundary disputes, urban financialization and decay, political ecology, social movements, race and indigeneity, Black geographies, cultural identities, and how these relate to the protection, justice, and concern for the environment, including climate change and recycling/sustainability practices. On the other hand, Environmentalists work as policy analysts and natural resource conservationists, dealing with issues as wide-ranging as food production, marine exploitation, soil pollution, land use planning, coastal protection, severe storm mitigation, waste disposal, environmental health, and urban sustainability. Many of these are mapped and monitored using geographic information systems (GIS), including remote sensing and spatial statistics. Students are encouraged to use the College of Social Sciences and Public Policy’s GIS laboratory, running the market-leader ArcGIS software. The two degrees provide access to jobs that help determine where public facilities, infrastructure, and environmental resources are located, counted, measured, and evaluated so that they provide benefit to as many people as possible within the best interests of the natural environment. Amongst the breadth of jobs, students are employed as planning and development surveyors, environmental consultants, real estate appraisers, land use analysts, park rangers, market researchers, cartographers, GIS analysts, foresters, demographers, natural resource managers, tour guides, soil scientists, and teachers. For a complete education in Geography or Environment & Society, all students are given the opportunity to take courses that reflect the Department’s research strengths in transportation optimization, land use/land cover change, urban growth, population mapping, regionalization and location theory, political ecology, race and identity, environmental conflict and policy, urban sustainability, environmental health, hurricane forecasting, tropical forests and grasslands, coastal and estuarine ecosystems, energy consumption and conservation, and biodiversity and resource management.

State of Florida Common Program Prerequisites The state of Florida has identified common program prerequisites for this University degree program. Specific prerequisites are required for admission into the upper-division program and must be completed by the student at either a community college or a state university prior to being admitted to this program. Students may be admitted into the University without completing the prerequisites, but may not be admitted into the program. At the time this document was published, some common program prerequisites were being reviewed by the state of Florida and may have been revised. Please visit https://dlss.flvc.org/admin-tools/common-prerequisites-manuals for a current list of state-approved prerequisites. The following lists the common program prerequisites or their substitutions, necessary for admission into this upper-division degree program: Geography GEO XXXX and GEO XXXX: two introductory geography courses (GEO prefix) for a total of six credit hours Geography Major Geography bridges the social sciences and physical sciences in the pursuit of how humans affect and are affected by natural environment. Geographers examine many social/physical issues at every scale, such as housing development and habitat loss, insurance premiums and storm damage, commercial fishing and marine sustainability, transport flow and air pollution, energy needs and mineral exploitation, and intensive farming and deforestation. Geography is the study of place and space, in the same sense that history is the study of time. Geographers ask: where are things located? Why are they located where they are? And how do we map them? Geographers are concerned with mapping how changes to the landscape, vegetation, animals, and climate impact where humans live, socialize, work, trade, and form cultural and nationalist identities. They examine agricultural practices, industry, boundary disputes, urban decay, political ideologies, religious principles, and how these relate to perceptions of the environment, concern for global warming, and recycling/sustainability practices. All of these can by mapped using computer-based GIS, GPS and satellite surveillance techniques with ever-improving geographic accuracy and precision.

For more information contact the Department of Geography or visit the department’s Website at https://geography.fsu.edu/. Environment & Society Major Environment & Society is an interdisciplinary STEM program of study that explores how humans affect and are affected by changes in the natural environment. It combines courses from the social sciences and the natural sciences to investigate today’s pressing environmental issues, such as ecosystem management, climate change, natural resource conservation, food production, marine exploitation, urban sustainability, land use planning, severe storm mitigation, and environment health—including how these issues are debated, measured, evaluated and then formulated into public policy. The major is highly flexible and allows students to explore a wide variety of classes when choosing how to study how humans interact, control, and live in harmony with nature. It requires forty-one semester hours with a grade of “C–” or better in each course; at least eighteen semester hours must be taken in upper-level (3000- and 4000-level) courses.

The course is held in a GIS computer lab, where data on health is analyzed and applications in health and medicine are discussed as ongoing challenges in data collection related to issues of surveillance and privacy. IDS 2180. Dead Cities (3). This course poses the question: How can we understand and respond to urban decay and decline? Using examples from the U.S. and abroad, students explore the differences between “conventional” urban poverty (which may be a necessary part of successful cities), systematic urban decline, new suburban poverty, favelas and shantytowns, etc. Students also examine recent strategies to “reclaim” failing cities. IDS 2227. Sustainable Society (3). This course provides students with the opportunity to observe and inquire about sustainable practices through field studies at local organic farm, hydro-power station, new urbanism community, and recycling facilities, etc., as well as through interactions with community-based programs.

Students also gain insight into field-based inquiry and techniques to monitor and assess plant populations, communities, and ecosystems. IDS 2492. Sport: Place, Competition, and Fairness (3). This course investigates the uneven distribution of sport and attitudes to sport; where money drives competition, and where culture dictates ‘acceptable’ levels of competition. Students evaluate the ethics and fairness of gamesmanship and sportsmanship, and how ‘success’ in sport has various definitions, including personal satisfaction, tribal coherence, and externalities linked with ‘psychic income.’ IDS 3336. “Great” Britain? Geography, Imperialism, Industry, and Culture (3).
