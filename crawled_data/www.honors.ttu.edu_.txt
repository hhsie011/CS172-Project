Honors College students simultaneously benefit from being with others of the same intellectual preparation and commitment while enjoying the advantages of a university environment actively engaged in exploring all areas of human interest and concern. All students who are admitted to Texas Tech and the Honors College also enroll in a disciplinary college and pursue one or more of the 150+ available majors and concentrations, including one major housed within the Honors College, Honors Arts and Letters. Their education is the result of the integration of all colleges at TTU, including the Honors College, that cultivate the talents and interests of Honors College students and endeavor to meet their changing needs as they develop academically and socially.
