Full Text Research Research Overview Professor Chason's research focuses on the evolution of thin films and surfaces, including the development of in situ diagnostics to monitor changes in stress and morphology as they occur. Recent studies involve residual stress during thin film growth, whisker formation in Sn coatings, and self-organized pattern formation during ion sputtering. This work includes experiments, computer simulation, and development of models to relate the experimental results to fundamental materials processes. More information about our research can be found at our lab website (http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Engineering/Labs/Chason/research/index.html). Research Statement Professor Chason's primary research interest is the evolution of thin films and surfaces during processing. As the dimensions of advanced device structures continue to decrease, it becomes increasingly important to understand how thin films develop in order to precisely control their structure and properties. A major aspect of this research has been the development of in situ diagnostics that enable the changes in morphology and microstructure to be monitored as they occur. Recent work has focused on 1) the development of residual stress during thin film growth; 2) the processes controlling the formation of whiskers in Sn coatings; 3) evolution of self-organized surface patterns during low energy ion sputtering; and 4) stress relaxation in heteroepitaxial layers via dislocations and islanding. This work includes experimental measurements, computer simulation of film growth and sputtering, and development of models to relate the experimental results to fundamental materials processes. Research techniques developed include a multi-beam optical sensor (MOSS) for measuring wafer curvature (proportional to film stress) during growth in ultra-high vacuum and other environments. In addition, a novel in situ spectroscopic light scattering technique allows the measurements of surface morphology without interrupting processing. In situ x-ray reflectivity has also been developed in order to study surface roughness and buried interfaces during growth, annealing, and low energy ion sputtering.
