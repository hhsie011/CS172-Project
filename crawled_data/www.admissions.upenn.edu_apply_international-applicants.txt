In the continuum of this work, there are distinct phases. At the beginning of the process, itâ€™s important to create time and space for reflection. Strive to better understand who you are as a leader and thinker and the contributions you hope to make to the world. In time, you will learn about potential college matches by doing research online, speaking with mentors and guidance counselors, and perhaps visiting campuses. During your senior year, you familiarize yourself with logistics and the steps needed to complete your college applications. You record deadlines, start writing and proofreading essays, and organize school-specific requirements. The college process does not end until after you receive your acceptance letters and decide which campus community best supports your identity, ideas, and goals. To begin, you should select the application process that is right for you: are you applying as a first-year or transfer student?
