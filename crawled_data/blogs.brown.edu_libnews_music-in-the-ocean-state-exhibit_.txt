This exhibit will be up until the end of the summer. The media, books, and music on display represent just a tiny fraction of the talent found in Rhode Island. As you can see, some artists are from out of state, some are homegrown, and many are Brown alums. For the smallest state in the union, we’re not only blessed with a wealth of musicians, but also many musical venues and festivals.
