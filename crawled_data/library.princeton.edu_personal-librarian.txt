About Princeton’s Personal Librarian Program Navigating the rich resources at Princeton University Library can be challenging for new students, so in fall ’17 we launched a “Personal Librarian” program that pairs every Princeton undergraduate with a friendly library expert. Your Personal Librarian will help you navigate the library system, get started with research, point you to subject experts, and answer any questions you might have!
