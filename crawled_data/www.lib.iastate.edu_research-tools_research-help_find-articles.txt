Find Articles There are several ways to find articles — choose the one that best meets your need! Quick Search Use the Quick Search box on the Library home page to search for your topic. On the results screen, limit to articles using the Tweak My Results column on the right side of the page. The system will retrieve articles from the Quick Search Articles database, a collection of over 400 million articles from major journal publishers and open access repositories. Many of the articles you retrieve will be available online. Not all article databases are available via Quick Search. For more database options, or to search a specific article database through its own unique interface, try... Article Indexes & Databases On the Article Indexes and Databases page, you can use the All Subjects dropdown to choose a subject area and then get a list of databases for that subject area. You can also browse alphabetically by database title or use the search box to locate a specific database. When you find the database you want, just click its name to enter it and search. Journals If you're looking for a specific journal, you can use the Journal Search feature in Quick Search. Enter your journal's name or use the A-Z index below the Journals search box to browse and find your journal. Guides Librarians at ISU have prepared numerous guides to support research — both basic and advanced — in a variety of subject areas. Some guides are tailored to specific ISU courses. Often these guides provide helpful information on locating articles in relevant journals, magazines, and newspapers. Need more help? Contact a liaison librarian or Ask us!
