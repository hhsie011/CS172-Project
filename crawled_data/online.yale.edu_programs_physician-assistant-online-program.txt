Pediatric, emergency, and geriatric medicine are integrated throughout the curriculum as students work to refine their clinical skills and consider how learned material is applicable in real-life situations. Yale PA Online Program students meet in live classes each week to engage with faculty members and fellow students. Coursework is delivered through a multimedia format, and the curriculum takes an organ-systems approach to medicine.

Students spend 15 months in these rotations and also attend three week-long on-campus immersions. Additionally, the Clinical Experience in Early Didactic (CEED) provides first-year students in the Yale PA Online Program with 120+ hours of direct patient care experience in the didactic year.
