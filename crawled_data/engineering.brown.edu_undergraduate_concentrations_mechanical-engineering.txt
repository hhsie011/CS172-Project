Bachelor of Arts Concentration Options Declaring a Concentration Mechanical Engineering Sc.B. in Mechanical Engineering Mechanical engineering is the broadest of all engineering disciplines. The traditional role of a mechanical engineer is to design engines and turbines; renewable and conventional energy conversion systems; vehicles and aircraft; tooling and manufacturing equipment, and building services. The field continues to evolve: today's mechanical engineers design biomedical devices and instrumentation; sensors; 3D printers; micro-electro-mechanical systems; and robots. Since all products need to be designed to withstand stress, vibrations and heat, mechanical engineers are in demand at nearly all companies, including those that design and manufacture consumer electronics; semiconductor and computer manufacturers, and software companies specializing in computer-aided-design. The curriculum in Mechanical Engineering is intended to provide students with a broad interdisciplinary foundation; and specialized training in the two pillars of mechanical engineering: mechanical and thermal systems. The program offers a wide range of specialized tracks within mechanical engineering, allowing students to design a program tailored to their individual goals. The concentration is composed of the following courses: The interdisciplinary core courses for the Sc.B, taken during the first five semesters A specialized upper level course in Mechanical Systems A specialized upper level course in Fluid and Thermal Systems Three additional specialized upper level elective engineering courses A capstone design course An advanced science course Four approved courses in the humanities and social sciences For example, courses may be combined to create the following focus areas within Mechanical Engineering. Suggested combinations of courses for each option are listed in the tables at the bottom of this page. These are just suggestions, and other options are possible.
