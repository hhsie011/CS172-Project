CIW staff will help you identify the best opportunities and ensure that your internship applications are competitive. In addition to attending your internship during the day, you'll take at least one four-credit Cornell course in the evening. On the weekends, CIW offers unique D.C. experiences, such as visiting Smithsonian museums, catching a Nationals baseball game, and attending a performance at the Kennedy Center. You'll live in comfortable apartments (each with its own full kitchen and private bathroom) and take your class in the Cornell owned-and-operated Wolpe Center, in the lovely and centrally located neighborhood of Dupont Circle.

See faculty David Silbey Associate director, Cornell in Washington Ronald Christie Founder and CEO, Christie Strategies Student experiences "CIW in the summer is very different than CIW during the academic year as there is far more free time to take a real break and explore some part of ourselves outside our 'normal academic patterns.' I left DC with this other-worldly knowledge of career options and a greater understanding and appreciation for my own personal and academic/career development outside of the common pre-med track." Kirkland Sugrim, CIW Summer '19 "During my CIW summer I worked at Resolution Economics, a litigation consulting firm focused on providing economic and statistical analysis in expert witness testimony. I helped analyze employment data in discrimination cases using a programming language called SAS."
