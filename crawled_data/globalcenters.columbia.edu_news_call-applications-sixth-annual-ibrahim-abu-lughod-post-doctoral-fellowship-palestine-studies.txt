February 15, 2016 This post-doctoral fellowship seeks to recognize and foster innovative and ground-breaking scholarship on issues related to Palestine and Palestinians. The award will support a scholar working on a book project in any field of the humanities or social sciences. The Fellow will spend one semester at Columbia University in New York, pursuing her or his research and writing, and participating in the intellectual life of the Center for Palestine Studies. The international competition is open to all post-doctoral scholars who share the mission of the Center for Palestine Studies to advance the production and circulation of knowledge on Palestinian history, culture, society, and politics through outstanding scholarship. The one-semester fellowship at Columbia carries a stipend of $25,000 and the status of post-doctoral research fellow or visiting scholar, as appropriate. Previous IAL fellows include Lena Meari, who spent Spring 2012 working on her book, Interrogating "Painful" Encounters, an ethnographic, historical, and philosophical study of the encounter between Palestinian political activists and interrogators from the Israeli General Security Service. Leena Dallasheh spent Fall 2012 working on her book manuscript entitled Contested Citizenship in Nazareth: Palestinians' Transition from the Mandate to Israel. Mezna Qato, the third IAL Award recipient, spent Spring 2014 working on a book project, a social history of the Palestinian educational experience in Jordan. Omar Tesdell, spent last Spring 2015 working on a book project based on his dissertation, Shadow Spaces: Territory, Sovereignty, and the Question of Palestinian Cultivation, a spatial history of Palestinian environmental and agricultural practice. The current fellow Areej Sabbagh-Khoury is working on a book project based on her dissertation research, Colonization Practices and Interactions at the Frontier: Ha-Shomer Ha-Tzair Kibbutzim and the Surrounding Arab Villages at the Margins of the Valley of Jezreel/Marj Ibn 'Amer, 1936-1956. This award has been made possible by the generosity of Abdel Mohsin Al-Qattan, through the A.M. Qattan Foundation, in honor of his friend, the Palestinian scholar and intellectual, Ibrahim Abu-Lughod (1929-2001). Their close friendship began in the aftermath of the nakbah of 1948 and evolved into a shared commitment to justice for Palestinians to be realized in part through support for excellence in higher education and scholarship. In later years, upon the establishment of the A.M. Qattan Foundation in Palestine, Ibrahim Abu-Lughod helped found the Qattan Centre for Educational Research and Development; one of the Foundation's core programs. The application deadline is February 15, 2016. More details and application information for 2016-17 are available on the Fellowships page. Please e-mail [email protected] with any questions.
