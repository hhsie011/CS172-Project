April 13, 2021 Dear Members of the Boston College Community: Soon the Class of 2021 will be graduating from Boston College, and I would like to provide information about Commencement Weekend plans. Baccalaureate Mass will be celebrated in Alumni Stadium at noon on Sunday, May 23. Commencement will take place in Alumni Stadium at 10 a.m. on May 24. Because of COVID-19 health and capacity regulations, attendance, unfortunately, will be limited to graduates, trustees, senior administrators, honorary degree recipients, and faculty marshals. All Commencement events will be livestreamed and available to parents and family members via the following link: http://on.bc.edu/Commencement2021. Graduates and parents are encouraged to monitor the Commencement website for information regarding Senior Week, school-specific degree ceremonies, and the Residential Life move-out process. Our Commencement speaker will be New York Times columnist, PBS, NPR, and NBC commentator, and best-selling author David Brooks. His fellow honorary degree recipients include President and Executive Director of the Pine Street Inn Lyndia Downie; Fessenden School administrator and former BC football captain and NFL player Sean Guthrie ’01, M.Ed. ’14; Mondelez International Vice President and Chief of Global Impact, Sustainability, and Well-Being Christine Montenegro McGrath ’87; and former Boston College Vice President for Human Resources and Senior Advisor to the President Leo V. Sullivan, M.Ed. ’80, P ’89, P ’90. The past year has certainly had its challenges, but our community has responded with great generosity and commitment. BC’s 144th Commencement is cause to recognize the accomplishments of our graduates and to thank them for their many contributions during their time at “the Heights.” Sincerely, William P. Leahy, S.J. President Office of the President 140 Commonwealth Avenue Chestnut Hill, MA 02467
