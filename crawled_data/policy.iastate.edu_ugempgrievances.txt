Undergraduate student-employees have the right to appeal any action which they believe has been unfairly taken, by filing the Undergraduate Student-Employee Grievance Form (see Resources below). Undergraduate student-employees may not be terminated in retaliation for reporting misconduct. All undergraduate student-employees are encouraged to discuss concerns with their immediate supervisor prior to filing a grievance. The Undergraduate Student-Employee Grievance Procedure (see Resources below) does not apply to claims of discrimination or harassment. For those types of claims, please see the related policies linked below. The Undergraduate Student-Employee Grievance Procedure does not apply to issues related to general wage adjustment.
