This technique uses a set of operations to generate a target Hamiltonian with which to apply to a system. Specifically, in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of solids, magnetic dipolar interactions between the spins of the protons causes the signal we receive to rapidly decay without the implementation of Hamiltonian engineering. We used Hamiltonian engineering to design sequences of magnetic pulses to decouple these dipolar interactions to increase sample’s coherence time. Historically, Average Hamiltonian Theory (AHT) has been the methodology used to both design these pulses sequences as well as to characterize their sensitivity to error. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as another avenue to engineer Hamiltonians. RL is a type of machine learning and treats the system’s dynamics as a black box but has the potential to provide robustness to experimen-tal imperfections. However, unconstrained RL algorithms have not outperformed conventional methods to date. In this thesis, we used theoretical insights into the quantum dynamics of the interacting spin systems to constrain the action space of the RL algorithm, while also tweaking the RL algorithm itself. For the problem of decoupling magnetic dipolar interactions in solid-state spin systems, this approach allowed us to design multiple pulse sequences which have fidelities at a higher level than other sequences designed either with AHT or other RL algorithms.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Physics and Astronomy Undergraduate Overview Information for New Students Physics Major Astronomy Major Engineering Physics Major Undergraduate Awards Honors Recent Senior Theses Undergraduate Requirements Physics and Astronomy Course Offerings Physics Society Student Research Opportunities Careers in Physics and Astronomy Astronomy and Your Career Undergraduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Graduate Overview Graduate Awards Apply Financial Aid Degree Requirements Courses Recent PhD Graduates Graduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Foreign Study Overview Astronomy FSP in South Africa Research Overview All Projects Astrophysics Current Projects Particles, Fields, Gravitation, and Cosmology Current Projects Gravitational Quantum Physics Quantum and Condensed Matter Current Projects Plasma and Space Physics Current Projects Resources Overview Weather Archive News & Events News & Events Colloquia Physics and Astronomy Colloquia Colloquium Archives (before 2017) Symposiums Symposium on Charles Young's 1869 Discovery of Coronium Jay Lawrence Symposium Archive Pressure of Light Symposium Public Lecture Archives Public Observing People Faculty & Staff Students Alumni Advisory Board Membership Directory Committee Assignments Department Chair Diversity Statement Graduate Advisor Undergraduate Advisor My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
