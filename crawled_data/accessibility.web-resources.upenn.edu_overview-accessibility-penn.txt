Diversity and inclusion are central to Penn’s mission, and the University is committed to sustaining a culture in which each individual’s dignity is acknowledged and accorded with respect. Because of this, Penn pledges to provide equal access to information and programs by making its websites and web application accessible. Penn websites and content are accessed and used by diverse people within the U.S. and around the world. Some users have visual, hearing, or cognitive impairments that create challenges in accessing website content, and require the use of assistive technologies, such as screen readers and text-only browsers. Other users of Penn websites may be using outmoded technology, or have very slow connection speeds. As such, it is imperative that Penn ensures its online presence and content remain accessible to the widest array of users.
