In these courses, you learn by doing. You'll begin with very simple picture-sentence combinations and progress rapidly to reading short narratives in Latin that gradually build up your vocabulary and your understanding of how Latin sentence structure is different from English. Along the way, you'll also have some opportunities to study images, floor plans, and bits of history that bring the Roman empire to life. If you have already read some Latin literature before coming to Dartmouth (for instance, an AP course in high school), you will probably want to start with Latin 15 (Literature and the Romans), which is offered every Fall. Latin 15 introduces you to essential elements of Roman literary culture and its academic study today: questions of literacy, book production, conceptions of literary achievement, textual transmission, and the relationship between antiquity and modernity. You also become familiar with library resources, including materials for reading Latin inscriptions and illuminated manuscripts in Dartmouth's collection. For students who have studied some Latin but are not quite ready for Latin 15, there is also Latin 10 (Reading Latin Texts), which is usually offered in the Winter term. Latin 10 introduces the skills that are needed for reading unadapted texts in Latin, including short selections from Catullus, Virgil, Pliny, and other authors. Both Latin 10 and Latin 15 also include some review of grammar as appropriate to your level. To determine what Latin class is best for you, please read About Placement in Latin Classes. To learn about satisfying the Language Requirement for graduation, please read About Satisfying the Language Requirement with Latin. Continuing Your Study of Latin Once you have completed your basic classes, you'll want to check out some of the more advanced Latin classes that are available at Dartmouth. These courses enable you to explore numerous different types of ancient texts: love poetry, historical narrative, scientific analysis and philosophical reflection. Numbering from LAT 20 through LAT 35 is by topic, not by level of difficulty. Consequently these courses may be taken in any order.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Classics Curriculum Overview Course Offerings by Term Fall 2021 Winter 2022 Spring 2022 Summer 2022 Fall 2022 Winter 2023 Spring 2023 2023-24 Classical Studies Courses Entry points for Classical Studies Literature, Philosophy, Religion Ancient History Classical Archaeology Language Study -- Latin Latin Classes Placement in Latin Language Study -- Ancient Greek Courses in Ancient Greek Placement in Ancient Greek Majors and Minors Classical Studies track Ancient History track Classical Archaeology track Classical Languages and Literature track Culminating Experience Foreign Study NEW Classics FSP in Spring 2022 Greece Foreign Study Program Rome Foreign Study Program Projects & Awards Classics-Related Projects and Awards Student Research Archaeological Fieldwork Reid/Wiencke Funding for Research Senior Honors Projects Awards & Prizes Faculty Media Projects Annual Lecture Programs Faculty Books Inclusivity News & Events People Our graduates Graduating with a Classics Degree Alumni Support Tell Us Your Story Alumni Stories My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
