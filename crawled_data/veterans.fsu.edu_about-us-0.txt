Failure to verify for two consecutive months will interrupt the Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA) and/or kicker payments. A simple and convenient verification option is to sign up for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) text message verification. Students with a US mobile phone number on file with the VA will receive an opt-in text as their next enrollment period approaches. Students who do not have a US mobile phone number on file with VA will not be able to use text verification and instead be automatically enrolled into email verification system. Another option for students who do not opt-in for text is to call the VA Education Call Center at 888-442-4551 to verify their enrollment status. Home About Us Student Veterans Center Staff Veterans Advancement Council Student Organizations and Groups Veteran Alumni Society Arrowhead Merchandise About Us Student Veterans Center MISSION & VISION Established on Florida State's campus on November 11, 2011, the Student Veterans Center (SVC) acts as the hub for veteran support and success initiatives. Its establishment was aided by the work of student veterans on campus at the time - one of which was Jared Lyon who is currently serving as the CEO of Student Veterans of America in Washington D.C. - and the university president at the time, Eric J. Barron. Colonel Billy Francis took on the role of director of the SVC, transitioning from his position leading Florida State's Air Force ROTC program. Florida State University takes enormous pride in the high levels of success its student veterans are achieving, which have positioned the university as a national leader for student-veteran support. In particular, the exceptionally high retention and graduation rates FSU student veterans now attain – which are significantly higher than just a few years ago – can be traced to state and university investments in veterans. By building on the benefits afforded veterans through the Florida G.I. Bill, FSU is maximizing the state's return on this educational investment. As a result, veterans at Florida State are earning degrees and excelling into meaningful careers at substantially higher rates than the national average. Accordingly, their post-service quality of life, and contributions to their local communities, are significantly enhanced. Veteran success at Florida State can be attributed to three broad objectives: (1) initiating, cultivating and sustaining relationships between veterans and the FSU community through the Student Veterans Center, (2) providing tangible resources and activities designed to foster these veterans' sense of connectedness to the university, and (3) raising awareness among the university community of the student veteran experience. Vision To become a national beacon of veteran support and success is the guiding principle of the Veterans Alliance, which encompasses Florida State University initiatives that ease the transition from military service to campus life, foster a community of past, present and future veterans, raise awareness of veterans issues among campus and local communities, and support student veterans through graduation and into rewarding careers and graduate education programs.
