The Harvard College Fund Executive Committee presents the following awards at Assembly each fall: Albert H. Gordon ’23 Award In 1990, the Fund established this annual award in honor of Albert Gordon, founder of the Associates Program, whose decades of leadership have challenged countless contributors to give more to Harvard than they had intended. The generosity and hard work of award recipients have significantly strengthened our annual giving programs. 2020-2021 Awardees Seth Bour ’11 Kelly Chang Levine ’11 Joseph R. Hamlen ’04 Award Established in 1989 in memory of Joseph Hamlen, Harvard College Fund founder and inaugural chairman, this award is given annually to participation leaders whose personal outreach to classmates results in broad donor support. 2020–2021 Awardee Katie D. McDonnell ’01 Roger Flather ’54 Award This award, created in 2006 to recognize the Harvard spirit embodied by Roger Flather, honors emerging pre-25th reunion leaders who have engaged classmates in an innovative and creative fashion, encouraging younger generations of alumni to initiate annual giving traditions of their own. 2020–2021 Awardees Class of 2011 10th Reunion Campaign Co-chairs: Pierre Abousleiman '11 Casey O'Donnell Buckley '11 Michael Puopolo '11 Alexander Roux '11 Douglas Schadewald '11 Kareem Zaki '11 Richard T.
