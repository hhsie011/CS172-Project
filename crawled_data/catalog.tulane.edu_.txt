University Catalog 2022-2023 Open catalog menu 2022-2023 University Catalog This version of the catalog was published in May 2022 and takes precedence over any previously printed or online catalog. The University Catalog is not intended to nor does it contain all regulations that relate to students. Students are held individually responsible for meeting all requirements as determined by Tulane University. Failure to read and comply with policies, regulations, and procedures will not exempt a student from being governed by and accountable to them. The catalog of the University is the document of authority for all students. Any academic unit may issue additional or more specific information (e.g. student handbooks or program manuals) that is consistent with approved policy. These publications provide detailed and useful information; however, the information in the catalog supersedes that issued by any other unit if there is a conflict between the two. The University reserves the right to change the requirements given in the catalog at any time. Changes will become effective whenever the proper authorities so determine and will apply to both prospective students and those already enrolled.
