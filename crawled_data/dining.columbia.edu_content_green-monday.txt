So, Monday is a great day to be mindful of the structure of our food intake and its effects on our bodies. Eating plant-based meals on Mondays may reduce the risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. It also helps to reduce our carbon footprint and save resources like fresh water and fossil fuels. Green Monday is observed by Columbia Dining each week with the inclusion of a vegetarian or vegan option at our meal stations. Standard meal options remain available, but we hope that you'll try something new and see if you begin to notice changes in the way you feel by making every Monday a green one. Learn more about the Green Monday initiative at greenmonday.org, including additional facts about how meat-heavy diets affect our health and our environment, as well as ways you can take action personally to make a change.
