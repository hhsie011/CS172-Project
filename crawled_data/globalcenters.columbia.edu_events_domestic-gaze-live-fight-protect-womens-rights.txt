The U.S. has a new president and historic new vice president, meanwhile many of us have had to adapt to living under constant lockdowns and confinements. Even with all this change, one thing has remained constant since the start of the pandemic: the disproportionate impact the devastating effects of COVID-19 have on those who identify as women. As part of our original podcast series, The Domestic Gaze took an intersectional approach to women's issues through three separate episodes: “Gender in the Pandemic: The Disproportionate Impacts on Women” by Terry McGovern; “Faces of the Frontline: Notes on Gender as a Frontliner” by Vibhu Krishna; and “Policing Black Bodies: Race and Gender in the Criminal Legal System” by Alexis J. Hoag. Through these episodes, The Domestic Gaze explored issues that pre-existed COVID-19, such as systemic racism, domestic violence, poverty, and the school-to-prison pipeline, and that have been exacerbated since. As we enter the second year of this pandemic in an almost unrecognisable world, join us for this very special bonus episode of The Domestic Gaze. Featuring Alexis J. Hoag, lecturer at Columbia Law School, Terry McGovern, Chair of the Heilbrunn Department of Population and Family Health, and Vibhu Krishna, medical student at Columbia University’s Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, in conversation for the first time to explore what has and hasn’t changed since their initial episodes, the continuing disproportionate impact COVID-19 has on women, and ways to mobilise to continue fighting for women’s rights. Panelists Alexis J. Hoag Alexis J. Hoag is Practitioner-in-Residence, Eric H. Holder Jr. Initiative and a lecturer at Columbia Law School Terry McGovern Terry McGovern is Harriet and Robert H. Heilbrunn Professor, Chair of the Heilbrunn Department of Population and Family Health, and Director of the Program on Global Health Justice and Governance at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health Vibhu Krishna Vibhu Krishna is a medical student at Columbia University’s Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, a Public Health strategy consultant, and Founder and Creative Director of Faces of the Frontline Upcoming Events Columbia Global CentersAmman / Beijing / Istanbul / Mumbai / Nairobi / Paris / Rio / Santiago / Tunis Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
