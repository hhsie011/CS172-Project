Day by Day Diversity Groups and Activities Housing New York City Day by Day Diversity Groups and Activities Housing New York City School Organizations Student organizations play a pivotal role in the life at the Mailman School. They offer leadership opportunities and a chance to work closely with faculty, administrators, and organizations across the city. On any given week, these groups bring noted public health practitioners to campus, arrange volunteer opportunities in the local community and beyond, and host social events. Mailman School students also connect with student groups at Columbia's other graduate schools, including Physicians and Surgeons’ Bard Hall Players, the Business School’s Healthcare Industry Association, and the annual Medical Center student production of The Vagina Monologues. Through these groups, students meet kindred spirits from across the University while participating in theatrical productions, conferences, and other activities. See the list of student groups.
