Students may cross-register for our classes as part of the standard tuition they pay at their home institution. GCWS offers up to six courses per year. Our topic-based courses change each year and our core courses include: Workshop for Dissertation Writers in Women’s and Gender Studies, Feminist and Queer Theory Feminist and Queer Methodology Students must submit an application to be considered for a GCWS course. GCWS Students Faculty GCWS courses are taught by faculty of any discipline at our member institutions. Course proposals should explicitly integrate gender analysis with issues of class, race, culture, ethnicity, and sexualities, and consider the practical implications of feminist theory. Courses are designed to open paths to the creation of new knowledge and provide intellectual support for students pursuing feminist work within the framework of traditional disciplines.
