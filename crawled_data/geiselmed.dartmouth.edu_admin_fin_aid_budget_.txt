If a student incurs additional educational expenses, which exceed the amount allocated in the budget, he/she should discuss this with the Financial Aid Officer. Summer Earning Expectation Students entering the Year 1 class are encouraged to contribute $5,000 of income (in addition to relocation expenses) earned during the summer preceding Year 1. Please note the Year 1 budget is 10 months and students should plan to bring their summer earnings for educational costs at Geisel when they matriculate in August. Students entering Year 2, 3, and 4 are should anticipate contributing $1,000. Year 1 & 2 Students The rent figure of $9,500 includes utilities based upon a 10-month budget, September through June. Travel Home Travel allowance will be made for one round trip home at standard air fares, assuming use of supersaver fares when possible. Please note that federal regulations do not permit us to include travel expenses for spouses. Books Budget figures reflect average book purchases in each class. Students whose necessary book purchases go beyond this level may seek a budget adjustment through the Financial Aid Office and borrow additional funds within reasonable limits. Computer & PDA Students who need additional funds for a computer should discuss the expense with their Financial Aid Officer. Each request will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Sources to Consider and Utility Plans When searching for housing, students should consider the source of heat. Electricity bills will increase substantially during the winter months when you heat with electricity, whereas oil and gas prices remain more constant throughout the year. Students making arrangements for delivery from local oil, gas, and electric companies are urged to request a budget plan in order to spread heating costs over the number of months in the academic year. Failure to do so may cause financial difficulty during the winter term. Some companies will allow customers to pre-purchase fuel for the entire year during the summer months when it is least expensive. Clinical Clerkships, Electives, USMLE, On Doctoring and Local Transportation Supplementary loans will be approved for students who live at a distance from the Medical School and find this assistance necessary, and/or for students who incur travel expenses in excess of the amount already included in the travel budget for reaching clinical clerkships and electives. The amount approved will be based on mileage at a rate of 56 cents per mile. Child Care Students with children may incur additional expenses beyond the limits of the student budget. As a starting point for discussion purposes, $3,000 per child per semester may be added to the budget. Because of the variability of expenses in this area, dictated both by age of the child and the type of day care available and/or preferred by the parent, students are encouraged to speak with the Financial Aid Director.
