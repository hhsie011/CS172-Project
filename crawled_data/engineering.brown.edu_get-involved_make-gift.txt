Give to Engineering Make a Gift The School of Engineering plays a prominent role in Brown’s efforts to translate groundbreaking research into real-world applications and solutions addressing societal problems. Through the BrownTogether Campaign, the School of Engineering aims to raise more than $184 million to support this work. This funding will allow us to maintain collaborative, forward-looking research spaces; hire new faculty in emerging engineering fields; expand our graduate programs in order to cultivate the next generation of trained professionals; and strengthen our already world-class undergraduate curriculum. Engineering has identified a set of funding priorities that is part of the University-wide Plan for Academic Enrichment. Engineering is focused on two priority areas: Supporting excellence in teaching, research, and scholarship through expanded opportunities for Brown’s faculty and students. Renovating research and teaching space to accommodate group study and faculty-student interaction outside the classroom and the lab.
