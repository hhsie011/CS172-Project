The Law Review accepts and scrutinizes approximately 2,000 written submissions annually to select pieces for the seven issues of each volume. The Law Review also affords associate editors two valuable educational experiences. First, the publication provides training in the performance of all the editorial and administrative tasks associated with the publication of a professional legal journal. Second, the Law Review assists each of its members in preparing an original work of scholarship suitable for professional publication. Associate editors are encouraged to write their student comments on a subject of particular interest to them, and up to twelve comments will be selected for publication.
