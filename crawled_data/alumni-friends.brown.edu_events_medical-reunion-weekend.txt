There are several options to join us virtually, as well. Please note: Brown University's May 26 Update on COVID-19 Protocols for On-Campus Activities Given increased rates of COVID-19 in Providence County and across the country, Brown has re-instituted its requirement that all individuals – regardless of vaccination status – must wear a well-fitting KN95, KF94, N95 or disposable/surgical mask indoors, unless in a private, non-shared space or when actively eating or drinking. The requirement aligns with guidance from the CDC and recommendations from the Rhode Island Department of Health. Visitors and guests should bring with them to campus, and carry with them at all times, an approved mask. The indoor mask requirement applies to all University-sponsored events, on- and off-campus, taking place during Commencement and Reunion Weekend and to all attendees: faculty, students, staff, families, visitors, guests and vendors. Masks can be removed indoors by a speaker while making a presentation or delivering a speech. We strongly advise individuals to take a rapid antigen test prior to attending large indoor gatherings. Brown community members, visitors and guests should not attend any University events or functions if they test positive for COVID-19 and/or are experiencing potential symptoms of COVID-19. Throughout your participation in the weekend’s activities, please visit the "Commencement and Reunion Visitors & Guests" portion of Brown’s Healthy Brown website for the most up-to-date information for graduates, families and guests participating in Commencement and Reunion. If you have any questions, please contact ellen_schulte@brown.edu.
