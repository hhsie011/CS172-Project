The Yale Liver Center has been funded continuously since 1984 and is one of only four that focus on the liver. The Yale Liver Center supports investigation of liver structure, function and disease. Research support is provided through the Center’s Four Core Facilities, as well as through Pilot Feasibility Projects that are offered annually. The research base is focused on three broad areas of liver biology and pathobiology: Immunobiology and Inflammation Hepatic Metabolism Epithelial Biology and Pathobiology Currently, 34 independent principal investigators are Members of the Center as well as 52 Associate Members, which involves 17 departments at Yale including: Biomedical and Chemical Engineering Cell Biology Cellular and Molecular Physiology Comparative Medicine School of Public Health Genetics Immunobiology Internal Medicine Microbial Pathogenesis Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry Obstetrics and Gynecology Pathology Pediatrics Pharmacology Radiology Transplant and Surgery Urology. The Liver Center also supports weekly research seminars (on Tuesday afternoons) and clinical lectures (on Friday afternoons), in conjunction with the Section of Digestive Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine.

These include: Immunobiology and inflammation Hepatic metabolism Epithelial biology and pathobiology. The major areas of liver disease examined within these translational themes include autoimmune diseases, cholestasis, fibrosis/cirrhosis, genetic diseases, infections, liver cancer, and NASH/ASH. Many of our investigators have research interests that span multiple themes.
