Playlist No. 45 is by Shawn Maxam, senior associate director for institutional diversity and inclusion, and features Stevie Wonder, Janet Jackson and Wayne Shorter. Playlist No. 43 is by lecturer in music Trineice Robinson-Martin, an internationally recognized jazz, gospel and soul vocalist and teacher. Songs include Hale Smith's "Evocations," Alma Bazel Androzzo's hymn “If I Can Help Somebody,” and Anthony D.J. Branker’s “Ballad for Trayvon Martin.” “Black American Music maintains a specific cultural and social function that acknowledges, celebrates and ultimately epitomizes the journey of being Black in America,” Robinson-Martin wrote in presenting her selections. “These songs have encouraged me to reflect and continually reassess how the cultural and musical legacy of my ancestors and contemporaries have affected my understanding of who I am as an artist, educator and scholar. All rooted in the cultural function of Black music, I value how the composers and artists use their platform to inform their listeners, both consciously and subconsciously, of the multidimensions of Black excellence within the struggle.” Read more To explore other University resources related to Black history and its place within the context of Princeton University, visit: Princeton’s History and Sense of Place website Princeton and Slavery Project website Related Stories Imani Perry’s selections for Black History Month, plus University events and resources for learning and discovery Read more University events will commemorate Martin Luther King Jr. Read more The nexus factor: Examining the African American experience Read more Princeton recognizes 50 years of community and inclusion Read more Be a Princetonian — get out and vote!
