I wear many hats in the library. I perform research and reference using our collections for our staff and outside researchers and create exhibitions of archival materials for the library and the Arboretum website. I also manage new book and archival acquisitions. Earlier in my time here, I was the project cataloger for the digitization of several of our historical photograph collections. This has given me an in-depth knowledge of our holdings, and helps me fulfill requests for the use of our historical images. Prior to coming to the Arnold Arboretum, I was employed for many years as a librarian in the insurance industry, first on the property/casualty side and later in the life/health and financial services realm. Outside of work, I am an artist working in metal, wood, leather, and textiles. In addition to my artistic pursuits, I am involved with living history interpretation of the period 1580-1610. As an adjunct to that, I am a student of costume construction techniques of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Visit the Arboretum Library! Books Pearson, L.E., Arnold Arboretum.

The Arnold Arboretum has been funded by the generosity of the supporting public since our founding in 1872. Give today and continue that legacy.
