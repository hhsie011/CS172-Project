For the eighth consecutive year, FSU has received a Higher Education Excellence in Diversity (HEED) award, which recognizes U.S. colleges and universities that demonstrate a commitment to diversity and inclusion, with a sustainable impact on the campus community and culture. “We are proud of the recognition but acknowledge that each year the bar gets higher,” said Michelle Douglas, director of the Human Resources-Equity, Diversity & Inclusion Office and the university’s Chief Diversity Officer. “As this is an honor that the entire campus community has earned, it is work that we plan to continue with contributions from all sectors of the FSU community.” Also, for the sixth consecutive year, the publication named FSU a Diversity Champion, which acknowledges those institutions that score in the top tier of all HEED Award institutions. This year, only 15 HEED award institutions earned Champion status. “The HEED Award process consists of a comprehensive and rigorous application that includes questions relating to the recruitment and retention of students and employees — and best practices for both — continued leadership support for diversity, and other aspects of campus diversity and inclusion,” said Lenore Pearlstein, publisher of INSIGHT Into Diversity magazine. Florida State is specifically recognized for its strategic plan, the President’s Task Force on Anti-Racism, Equity, and Inclusion and the academic support provided to diverse students, resulting in successful graduation rates. In addition to the university-wide recognition, the FSU College of Medicine received the 2021 Health Professions Higher Education Excellence in Diversity (HEED) Award from the magazine. The award recognizes U.S. medical, dental, pharmacy, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, allied health and other health schools and centers demonstrating an outstanding commitment to diversity and inclusion. The College of Medicine, one of 51 health-professions programs honored, is receiving the award for a fifth consecutive time. “This medical school was founded with a mission of producing future physicians who would help meet the health-care needs in communities that have traditionally struggled to have adequate access to care,” College of Medicine Dean John P. Fogarty said. “We are proud that this award continues to affirm that we are true to that mission, and we are succeeding in producing the physicians Florida — as well as the rest of the U.S. — needs most. We are very pleased that we have produced numerous alumni who now practice in rural parts of the state, especially in Northwest Florida.” The FSU College of Medicine is among the top 5% nationally for graduation of Black/African American students, the top 9% for Hispanic, Latino and Spanish students and the top 6% for alumni practicing in medically underserved areas, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. More than a decade ago, FSU officials crafted a comprehensive plan to unite efforts for diversity and inclusion across all areas of the campus. Through that effort, the President’s Council on Diversity and Inclusion was formed, comprising a group of faculty, staff and students committed to championing diversity, inclusion and social justice. Members of the council continue to support many initiatives throughout the university, including efforts to recruit and retain a diverse faculty, staff and student body. These include the Civil Rights Institute, the Equity, Diversity & Inclusion Internship program, the Power of We student initiative, seven employee affinity groups, the President’s Diversity and Inclusion Mini-Grant Program, the National Coalition Building Institute (NCBI) and the Diversity and Inclusion Certificate Series. Florida State will be featured in the November 2021 issue of INSIGHT Into Diversity magazine, while the College of Medicine will be featured in the magazine’s December issue.
