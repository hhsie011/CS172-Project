Overview Students may propose a modified major in English by designing a special program of study in consultation with a faculty advisor in the Department. One may modify the major in English with a selection of courses from other departments and programs, or one may modify a major in another department or program with a selection of English courses. In both cases the modifying courses nominated must be courses that qualify for major credit in their home department or program. The Culminating Experience should be satisfied according to the primary department's or program's rules. Proposals for modifying the major in English should also explain the rationale for modifying the standard major. Proposals for both kinds of modified majors must be submitted to the Vice Chair of the English and Creative Writing Department as a formal petition and proposal. Proposals to modify another major with English courses must be approved by the Vice Chair of English and Creative Writing before going forward to the primary department or program for final approval as a major program. Proposals to modify the major in English with other courses must be submitted, along with an authorizing signature from the secondary department or program, to the Vice Chair of English and Creative Writing and the CDC for their deliberation and approval. The Vice Chair's signature signifies final approval of a modified major in English. Modified major in which English is the primary subject This major requires the successful completion of eleven major courses, including seven courses in the Department of English and Creative Writing. All of the distributive requirements governing the regular English major, as outlined above, apply to the modified major. Along with the English courses taken in satisfaction of the major distributive requirements, a modified major includes four courses from the modifying department or program (or from multiple departments and programs), which substitute for four elective English courses in the eleven-course major. Modified major in other departments or programs modified with English courses Requirements: Four English courses selected from the major credit courses. No substitutions or transfer credits are permitted.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of English and Creative Writing Undergraduate Overview Major, Minor, and Modified Major Major Minor Modified Major Transfer Credit Creative Writing Concentration Honors Courses Course Group I Course Group II Course Group III Course Group IV Courses (No Group) Creative Writing Courses Courses (No Major Credit) Foreign Study Courses Independent Study and Honors The Historical Philosophy of W.E.B.
