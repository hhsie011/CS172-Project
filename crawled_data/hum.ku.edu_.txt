If you are an HUM/PCS Major or Minor you can still complete your degree. Many HUM/PCS courses will be offered in fall 2022, and substitutions are also available for remaining degree requirements. For advising help contact Antha Cotten-Spreckelmeyer (arcs@ku.edu) or Nicole Evans (nicoleevans@ku.edu). Pledge of the Humanities Join us in the Humanities Program as we pledge to cultivate an environment of compassion, tolerance and understanding. Recent events in Minneapolis and other cities are a wake-up call for honest, self-evaluation, which is a necessary prerequisite for positive change. As Dr. Martin Luther King said, “The universe is on the side of justice.” King’s philosophy of non-violent resistance offers us a model of critical self-assessment by focusing on the wisdom and relevance of great thinkers of the past. Our Humanities courses offer students a wide range of readings from the Hebrew Tanakh and Christian Gospels to the writings of Mahatma Gandhi, Karl Marx, John Locke, Martin Luther King and many others. Engaging with the Big Questions through reading, writing, and discussion empowers you to have your own impactful voice heard in the world. Maya Angelou said it best: “Words mean more than what is set down on paper. It takes the human voice to infuse them with deeper meaning.” Humanities courses offer you opportunities to learn about a diversity of cultures; they also offer a variety of methods for how to evaluate, objectively and critically, the relative reasonableness of those various perspectives. This self-reflective, self-critical attitude is embodied in Plato’s work, the Apology, when Socrates says, “the unexamined life is not worth living.” It is time for us all to have difficult, but constructive, conversations about race, gender and unearned privilege. This is our wake-up call and our mission: unflinching hope for a bright future together, with different voices united in plurality. ~ Rick Botkin, 6/10/2020 Fall 2021 Courses (Click a flyer to expand) https://www.facebook.com/HumanitiesatKU/ University of Kansas Humanities Program Visit KU/Lawrence About the Area Friendly folks.
