The includes learning about the institutional culture and resources for research support. The Research Road Map was developed to assist the UM community to navigate its research enterprise. At the U, each school, college or department is responsible for providing administrative support. This may include providing guidance to find funding, assisting with proposal preparation, and managing the project. For further clarification, please review the Roles and Responsibilities Matrix. Recent communications from federal agencies have made it clear that there is increased scrutiny from our research sponsors regarding our relationships with foreign entities. As a result, a number of investigators, here and at other universities, have asked for guidelines in this area. We hope the Foreign Engagement Guidelines will help clarify UMâ€™s position on various activities relating to foreign entities. Further information may be obtained from the Office of Research Administration, the Office of the Vice Provost for Research, the Office of Faculty Affairs, and the Office of Technology Transfer. Find Funding There is a wide range of funding opportunities for UM's researchers within the US federal government, as well as, through foundations, non-profit institutions, local and state government and corporations.
