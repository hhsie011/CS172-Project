With a transcript, timing information is added to create a caption file. While creating a transcript is often time consuming and error-prone for people who aren’t transcriptionists, there are some different options available to KU content creators to assist in making accessible multimedia. If you don’t have a transcript for your video, consider making one. If the video is not terribly long, can you create it yourself? If not could you possibly use a Teaching Assistant or student worker to create it for you? Remember the transcript itself can be an excellent resource to share with your students. Remember you can always use one of the approved vendors if you have the funds to pay for a professional to create the transcript. Once you have a transcript of the video, contact the Media Production Studio at itmps@ku.edu or 864-6452, and they can assist with syncing the transcript to your video to create the captioning required.
