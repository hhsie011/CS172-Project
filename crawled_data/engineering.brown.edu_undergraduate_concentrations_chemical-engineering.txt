Bachelor of Arts Concentration Options Declaring a Concentration Chemical Engineering Sc.B. in Chemical Engineering The traditional role of a chemical engineer is to design and operate large-scale processes for producing chemicals. While this remains a cornerstone of the discipline, advances in nanotechnology (the ability to control matter at molecular scales) have transformed the role of the chemical engineer. Today, chemical engineers work on inter-disciplinary teams to design pharmaceuticals, artificial organs, biomedical devices, chemical sensors, and drug delivery systems. They work on energy technologies, such as batteries, fuel and solar cells. They are at the forefront of sustainable design and manufacturing. The concentration has the following structure: The interdisciplinary core program for the Sc.B., taken primarily in the first four semesters Five upper level engineering courses, one of which is the required capstone design course for Chemical Engineering Organic chemistry and one approved upper level chemistry elective One approved, upper level elective course in the natural sciences Four approved humanities or social science courses Students may also elect to take specialized courses focusing on Biochemical Engineering/Biotechnology Computer Applications in Chemical Processing Electronics Applications in Chemical Processing Energy Production and Conversion Environmental Issues and Pollution Prevention Materials Processing and Synthesis Sample course plan For complete requirements, please see the University Bulletin.
