The University of Tulsa is perfectly sized to offer students new experiences and the freedom of self-discovery while providing the comfort and connections of a close-knit community. We work all year to help students succeed quickly at TU and to take their first steps into the academic, cultural, and social experiences available across campus. Everything we do is designed to help students transition to the routine and challenges of college life and to make many connections that will support them throughout their time at TU. Our team is available to help with any questions through email at StartTU@utulsa.edu or on the phone at 918-631-3590. To get ahead quickly at TU, sign up for New Student Orientation (August 17-20) by following this link. New Student Orientation The best stories have great beginnings. Start yours off right with our week-long experience designed to prepare new students for the challenges and opportunities that distinguish a TU education. New Student Orientation takes place before classes begin each semester. This fall, Orientation will take place August 17-20. New Student Orientation links every new student with one of our exceptional Peer Mentors who will also be part of their weekly FYE-1001 class. Through this 4-day experience new students learn pivotal information about campus life, discover campus organizations and services to help them succeed academically and professionally, and likely make some lifelong friendships along the way. Learn more. Register for Orientation by following this link. Transfer and Non-Traditional Student Orientation A half-day event is offered each semester in conjunction with the broader fall orientation program for first-year students. This abbreviated program focuses on topics, materials, and campus resources that research demonstrates will be helpful to students transferring into TU. This half-day event is typically attended by students transferring into TU with more than 30 hours of credit, as well as non-traditional students taking their first coursework at TU. The next Orientation for transfer and non-traditional students will be Saturday, August 20, 2022. Register by following this link. Spring Start Orientation Every January we host an orientation event for students beginning their academic studies at TU in the Spring Semester. This half-day program connects new students with campus professionals, student leaders and on-site resources who can help students succeed quickly. The spring-start Orientation is often hosted on the Saturday before January courses begin. 800 S.
