Established with a landmark gift to the University of the Jay I. Kislak Collection of the Early Americas, Exploration and Navigation, the Center houses the departments of Special Collections and University Archives and features a grand reading room in which to serve local and distant researchers. Although currently closed to the public, the Center will again be hosting public programing for the University’s centers, institutes, schools, colleges, and libraries during the evening and weekend hours, and the gallery showcases items from the vaults of these distinctive collections.
