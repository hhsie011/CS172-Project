Sign up for news and announcements Sign Up The Program in Medieval Studies at Princeton University encourages interdisciplinary study of the European Middle Ages: its art, literature (Latin and vernacular), music, religion, science, philosophy, politics and economic and social structures. Supported by the vast resources for medieval studies at Princeton University (including an outstanding manuscript collection and the photographic archive known as the Index of Medieval Art), it offers a certificate for undergraduates and, in that context, sponsors one course, an introductory seminar, and a (non-credit) thesis writers’ colloquium for seniors.
