Professor Hopkins' most recent book, Red Fighting Blue: How Geography and Electoral Rules Polarize American Politics (Cambridge University Press, 2017), demonstrates how the rise of the culture war, in combination with winner-take-all voting rules, has produced a regionally divided electorate and an ideologically divided party system in the United States. He has also co-authored Asymmetric Politics: Ideological Republicans and Group Interest Democrats (Oxford University Press, 2016) and Presidential Elections: Strategies and Structures of American Politics (Rowman & Littlefield, 2015). Professor Hopkins has shared his insight with local television affiliates, the Washington Post, NPR, the New Republic, and the Christian Science Monitor, and his research has been cited in the New York Times, Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, Slate, Salon, Vox, Commentary, and New York Magazine. Recently, he discussed Ayanna Pressley's primary victory in the state's 7th Congressional District with WHDH News. Professor Hopkins frequently serves as an expert commentator on American politics for international, national, and Boston-area media organizations. He blogs regularly about current events at honestgraft.com and can be found on Twitter at @DaveAHopkins.
