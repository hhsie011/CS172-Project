Hundreds of deeply committed faculty members, administrators, and College staff have worked hard to ensure our community is ready for our full return to campus life. FAS Fall 2021 Planning Update March 22nd, 2021 I am writing to share Dean Gay's message announcing that Harvard College expects a full return to campus for the Fall 2021 semester. Beginning the Spring Together January 26th, 2021 I hope that your new year is off to a good start, and that you are staying healthy. I am writing today to share a message which was sent to our students earlier today as we begin the spring semester together. Our Common Project January 21st, 2021 I write to share Dean Gay’s important letter to the faculty and staff from earlier today. While I was inspired by the words and performances during yesterday’s inauguration, especially those written by our own Amanda Gorman ’20, I was also painfully aware, as I’m sure you were, that it was occurring against the backdrop of the horrific events of January 6th. And it was difficult to face the fact that the lights illuminated around the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool marked the enormous loss of 400,000 lives to the pandemic in this country. Looking Forward to Spring Semester January 11th, 2021 I hope you are doing well and staying healthy during these difficult times. By now, you may have seen a message from University leaders earlier today noting the continued surge in COVID-19 cases. We continue to closely monitor the circumstances to ensure that we are doing everything we can to keep our community healthy. Reflections December 18th, 2020 As we approach the end of a year unlike any we could have ever imagined, there is simply no way that I can adequately express my gratitude for each and every one of you, and the partnership we have had during this extraordinarily challenging time. Spring Term and Panel Discussion Invite December 1st, 2020 By now, you have likely seen the message from President Bacow, Dean Gay and me sent earlier today regarding plans for the Spring 2021 term. Below you will find key points from the message, as well as an invitation to a panel discussion tomorrow (Wednesday, December 2nd) at 7:00 PM EST. So Much To Be Thankful For November 25th, 2020 Each year as I gather with family on Thanksgiving, one of the things I am most grateful for is the partnership of our students’ family and friends. Without your help and support, building this extraordinary community would never be possible. Some Thoughts Before Election Day October 30th, 2020 As we head into the final weekend before the U.S. presidential election, I am writing to share a message that will be sent to our students later this afternoon. As you are of course well aware, this year has presented our entire community with an unprecedented set of challenges. FAS Pandemic Management Update October 29th, 2020 Earlier today, Dean Gay shared the following update on planning for the spring semester with faculty and staff, which I hope will be helpful in your considerations as well.
