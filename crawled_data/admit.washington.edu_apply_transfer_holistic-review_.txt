Among community college transfer students, the highest admission priority is given to those with academic associate degrees and those with 90 transferable credits taken in preparation for a professional academic major. Applicants with fewer than 90 credits may be admitted when early transfer is advisable, but the number of such transfers will remain small. The Seattle campus of the UW generally dedicates thirty percent of its new undergraduate spaces annually to Washington community college transfer students, including Running Start students expecting to earn 40 or more transfer credits at a Washington community college. The UW admits applicants who have completed fewer than 40 quarter credits (slightly less than one year of college) at the time of application. However, admission for these applicants is competitive and limited.
