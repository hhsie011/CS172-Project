The Center seeks to achieve this objective through curriculum development and consultation, workshops and courses, materials dissemination, and education research. Lack of economic literacy among American families was a significant factor causing the 2007 recession. The increasing complexity of economic issues and problems requires that students develop an early understanding of the economic system within which they must operate as consumers, producers, and citizens. The Center for Economic Education at the College of Business and Economics (CBE) provides a comprehensive program to California classrooms with support from the California Council on Economic Education (CCEE) and the Council on Economic Education (CEE). Serving as the program arm of the CEE and CCEE, the Center provides important services to meet the economic education objectives of the CEE and its affiliated institutions. These services include: regular offering of on- and off-campus workshops and instructional programs in economics; providing consultation for schools, colleges, and community organizations; developing and/or distributing economic education materials; and conducting research in economic education.
