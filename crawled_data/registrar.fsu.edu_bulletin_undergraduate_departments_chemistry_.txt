DePrince; Associate Professors: Bleiholder, E. DePrince, Goldsby, Hanson, Hilinski, Hu, Kennemur; Assistant Professors: Frederich, Lazenby, Nienhaus, Silvers, Smith; Coordinator of General Chemistry Laboratories: Dillon; Coordinator of Organic Laboratories: Profeta; Professors Emeriti: Clark, Cooper, Cross, DeTar, Dorsey, Dougherty, Fulton, Holton, Light, Mellon, Safron, Schwartz, Vickers The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry offers the undergraduate degrees of Bachelor of Science (BS) and Bachelor of Arts (BA) in chemistry, biochemistry, and chemical science. Students seeking BS or BA degrees in chemistry may major in chemistry or environmental chemistry. Students seeking BS or BA degrees in chemical science may major in chemical science or chemical science/FSU-Teach. Please note that a student cannot receive more than one BS or BA degree from the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. For example, a student cannot double major in chemistry and biochemistry, due to substantial course overlap between the two majors. A degree in chemistry or biochemistry is suitable preparation for a variety of career choices, including immediate employment in the chemical, biochemical, environmental, or related industries, or graduate study in chemistry, biochemistry, chemical physics, biophysics, medicine, or other health-related fields. Chemistry majors should take note of the possibility of earning certification by the American Chemical Society in completing their degree requirements. Details of this program are given below. Additional work in mathematics and physics is appropriate for students planning to conduct graduate work in physical chemistry and chemical physics. For those interested in graduate work in biochemistry or biophysics, the baccalaureate degree in biochemistry or the degree in chemistry with electives including BCH 4053, BCH 4054, and selected biology courses is recommended. Students interested in careers in the environmental sciences, ecology and ecosystem management, and environmental toxicology are encouraged to obtain the chemistry degree with a major in environmental chemistry. In every case students should plan their programs in consultation with an academic advisor. Normally students begin taking courses required for the major in the first year, and it is important to consult with a chemistry advisor as early as possible. The baccalaureate degree in chemical science is offered to meet the needs of those students whose career goals lie outside chemistry but require a strong foundation in science. This program is appropriate, for example, for a student interested in forensic science, medical technology, oceanography, the earth sciences, or health-allied sciences, or for students planning a career in business, public policy, or law with an emphasis in science and/or technology. Compared to the other degree programs in this department, chemical science has a smaller core of required courses to which students are expected to add elective work in other areas after consultation with their advisor. Students interested in teaching chemistry in middle school or high school should consider majoring in chemical science/FSU-Teach; the FSU-Teach Program is described below. The chemical science degree is not appropriate for students interested in graduate study in chemistry or closely related disciplines such as biochemistry, environmental chemistry, or marine chemistry, or for students seeking employment in the chemical industry immediately upon graduation. Computer Skills Competency All undergraduates at Florida State University must demonstrate basic computer skills competency prior to graduation. As necessary computer competency skills vary from discipline to discipline, each major determines the courses needed to satisfy this requirement. Undergraduate majors in chemistry, biochemistry, and chemical science satisfy this requirement by earning a grade of “C–” or higher in CHM 3120L. Undergraduate majors in chemical science/FSU-Teach satisfy this requirement by earning a grade of “C–” or higher in CHM 3120L or ISC 3523C. State of Florida Common Program Prerequisites The state of Florida has identified common program prerequisites for this University degree program. Specific prerequisites are required for admission into the upper-division program and must be completed by the student at either a community college or a state university prior to being admitted to this program. Students may be admitted into the University without completing the prerequisites, but may not be admitted into the program. At the time this document was published, some common program prerequisites were being reviewed by the state of Florida and may have been revised. Please visit https://dlss.flvc.org/admin-tools/common-prerequisites-manuals for a current list of state-approved prerequisites. The following lists the common program prerequisites or their substitutions, necessary for admission into these upper-division degree programs: Chemistry CHM X045/X045L, or CHM X040 and CHM X041, or CHM X045C CHM X046/X046L or CHM X046C MAC X311 or MAC X281 MAC X312 or MAC X282 CHM X210/X210L and CHM X211/X211L, or CHM X210C and CHM X211C PHY X048/X048L and PHY X049/X049L, or PHY X048C and PHY X049C, or PHY X053/X053L and PHY X054/X054L, or PHY X053C and PHY X054C Note: The PHY X048/X049 sequence is required for the Bachelor of Science degree; it is an option for the Bachelor of Arts degree.

Honors in the Major The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry offers Honors in the Major to encourage students to undertake independent and original research. For requirements and other information, see the “University Honors Office and Honor Societies” chapter of this General Bulletin, or the departmental Website at https://www.chem.fsu.edu/. FSU-Teach Program in Teaching Chemistry For those also interested in teaching chemistry in middle school or high school, FSU-Teach is an innovative approach to teacher education that involves a collaboration between scientists, mathematicians, and education faculty at Florida State University. In FSU-Teach, students will acquire knowledge in science or mathematics and the skill and experience needed to be an effective science or math teacher. The program will pay for tuition for the first two courses, and work study positions with scientists, mathematicians, and local schools are available. For more information, see the FSU-Teach Website at https://fsu-teach.fsu.edu/. Requirements Please review all college-wide degree requirements, including the foreign language requirement, summarized in the “College of Arts and Sciences” chapter of this General Bulletin. The Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree can be obtained by completion of the Bachelor of Science (BS) degree requirements plus additional courses required by the University as set forth in the “Undergraduate Degree Requirements” chapter of this General Bulletin. Current majors in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry are generally discouraged from taking courses required for the major as transient students unless taken over the Summer, in order to meet milestones in their MAP. All upper-level chemistry courses (i.e. courses at the 3000 or 4000 level) applied toward any of the department’s majors must be taken at Florida State University, unless specifically exempted by the chair by written request. Students planning to transfer to Florida State University, either as a transfer or transient student, should make note of this requirement. Prospective majors should note the mathematics and physics requirements. To allow optimal flexibility in planning the upper-division programs, fulfillment of the mathematics requirements should be started in the freshman year. Chemistry, biochemistry, and environmental chemistry majors are required to take General Physics A and B (PHY 2048C and PHY 2049C) as preparation for Physical Chemistry I and II (CHM 4410 and CHM 4411). Chemical science majors may meet the physics requirement with either the calculus-based or non-calculus-based (PHY 2053C and PHY 2054C) physics sequence. The calculus courses required for the chemistry major constitute a minor in mathematics, and no other minor is necessary. The biology courses required for the baccalaureate degree in biochemistry constitute a minor in biological sciences, and no additional minor is necessary. The two courses in calculus (MAC 2311 and MAC 2312) and the two calculus-based physics courses (PHY 2048C and PHY 2049C) required for the environmental chemistry major constitute an interdepartmental minor approved by the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. This interdepartmental minor may be used for the chemical science majors who substitute calculus-based physics for the required non-calculus-based physics; otherwise, the baccalaureate degree in chemical science must include a minor of at least twelve semester hours in an approved minor field. No courses used for satisfying liberal studies requirements may also be counted toward the minor. Final clearance for all majors is made by the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. Students graduating must complete an exit survey, without which the department will not approve graduation. Academic Performance All State Common Program Prerequisites listed as Term 1–4 Milestones must be completed with a “C” range (C–, C, or C+) grade or better. Students earning less than the necessary grade in any of these courses will be required to retake those courses until the standard is met. Note: retaking a course may delay graduation and incur increased fee liability (i.e., repeat course surcharge and excess credit surcharge). All courses applicable to the major must be completed with a “C–” grade or better. Students must earn a “C–” or better in the first course of a two-semester sequence to continue that sequence (or file an undergraduate appeal with the Student Affairs Office, to be reviewed by the Undergraduate Advising and Awards Committee, to request taking the year-sequence course out of sequence). A student who has received more than three unsatisfactory grades (U, F, D–, D, or D+) in courses required for the major, excluding the Term 1–4 State Common Program Prerequisites milestone courses, taken after enrolling at FSU, will not be permitted to graduate with a degree in that major.
