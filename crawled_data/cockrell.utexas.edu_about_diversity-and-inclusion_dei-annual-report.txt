We recognize that individuals from all groups have not historically had the same access to engineering education, in general, and to the Cockrell School, more specifically, and we seek to address this moving forward. The Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Annual Report details efforts in 2020-2021 toward addressing the goals and initiatives outlined in the DEI plan. The report includes data about diversity, equity and inclusion in the Cockrell School, including community demographics, graduation and retention rates for undergraduate and graduate students, and insights from climate surveys.
