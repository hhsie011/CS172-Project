In addition, we offer the Copayment Reimbursement Program for Union Staff. You do not need to enroll in this program, but you do need to be enrolled in a Harvard HMO, POS or PPO health plan and file a claim in order to be reimbursed. Reimbursement Program This program provides financial assistance for faculty and nonunion staff who earn up to $110,000 annually, and are faced with high medical costs. Program details Reimbursement for in-network, out-of-pocket medical expenses above certain thresholds in a Harvard HMO, POS, or PPO plan, but not a HDHP plan. Expenses that count toward the thresholds include office visits, emergency room and pharmacy copayments, deductibles and coinsurance, but not premiums. You may use an FSA to cover costs up to the threshold and still use the reimbursement program for costs above the threshold. No enrollment is necessary but you must file to be reimbursed. Claims must be submitted by March 31 for the prior year (the deadline to file claims for expenses incurred during the 2022 calendar year is March 31, 2023). Benefit Strategies recommends that participants use the online portal or mobile app (search for “Benefit Strategies” on your mobile device’s app store) to submit claims and ensure timely service. For information on spending thresholds, salary limits, eligible expenses and how file a claim for reimbursement, please refer to the 2022 Reimbursement Program overview.

Supplemental Health Care Fund for Local 26 Members If you are a member of Local 26 and enrolled in a Harvard-sponsored medical plan, you may be reimbursed for emergency room, hospital and high-tech imaging copayments through the Supplemental Health Care Fund. You do not need to meet any salary or expense thresholds in order to apply for reimbursement through this fund. You cannot submit the same expense to both the Copayment Reimbursement Fund and the Supplemental Health Care Fund, and you cannot be reimbursed for expenses that have already been paid using a Flexible Spending Account (FSA). For information on 2022 claims, please refer to the 2022 Reimbursement Program overview. Reimbursement claims for 2022 copayments must be postmarked by January 31, 2023.
