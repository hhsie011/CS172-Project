Unlike other methods in tissue engineering that attach cells to a scaffold, cells are seeded into micro-molded nonadhesive agarose gels where they self-assemble an array of 3D multi-cellular microtissues in typically 24 hours. The platform technology works for a wide variety of cell types from cell lines to primary cells from numerous tissues and organs including those from human. The transparent micro-molded agarose provides a stable environment for long term (weeks) culture that is suitable for quantitative microscopy. These 3D microtissues mimic the function, morphology and cell density of natural tissues and organs and so provide a platform for the development of more predictive assays for drug discovery and toxicity testing. Many of the investigators in the Center use this platform technology to make microtissues mimicking various organ systems. The Morgan lab is investigating several areas including an ovary 3D microtissue for toxicity testing, the function of gap junctions, the role of drug efflux pumps and the development of quantitative confocal image-based high throughput 3D assays. 1 of 2 Many researchers at the Center use the 3D Petri Dish® as a platform to construct microtissues that mimic various organ systems.
