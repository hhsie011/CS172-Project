Posted on April 28, 2016April 28, 2016 Campus Technology magazine spotlights Clemson’s digital literacy focus Clemson University’s Center of Excellence strives to make students, faculty and staff literate in the ever-changing digital landscape. Recently, Campus Technology profiled Co-Director Dr. Jan Holmevik and Digital Faculty Scholar April O’Brien about the University’s push to highlight digital literacy and creativity in the classroom. The article details how the partnership between Adobe and Clemson began, how the discussion about digital education has shifted and how educators at Clemson are using new technologies and the new Adobe Digital Studio to make an impact on their students. Currently, nearly 30,000 members of the Clemson community have access to the Adobe Creative Cloud. On-campus training is also available for the software suite. “There is a difference between being digitally native and digitally literate. My new students find out quickly that their high degree of facility with cell phones and social media is simply not enough.” — April O’Brien For more, click here to read the full article.

Are. Clemson.” by Erin Smith “It is safe to say that Clemson is primarily a white university, diversity is not one of the school’s strengths right now; it has even been stated that Clemson, ‘…has the smallest share of African-American students of any public four-year S.C. college,’ (Shain, 1). Not to mention issues like the refusal to change the name of Tillman Hall and racist actions like the ‘Cripmas’ fraternity party (Shain, 1). Regardless of what side of these controversies people choose to be on, it is easy to see why a black student at Clemson would feel unheard, and even oppressed.” [/av_textblock] [/av_one_half] [/av_section] [av_one_half first min_height=” vertical_alignment=” space=” custom_margin=” margin=’0px’ padding=’0px’ border=” border_color=” radius=’0px’ background_color=” src=” background_position=’top left’ background_repeat=’no-repeat’ animation=”] [av_textblock size=” font_color=” color=”] “Locked Up: The Effects of Solitary Confinement” by Lindley Russell “Solitary confinement is a destructive practice that is commonly overused in United States prisons. In today’s society, solitary confinement is often abused and transformed from an adequate form of punishment to a cruel and unusual act of violence and violation of one’s rights. ‘There are many ways to destroy a person, but one of the simplest and most devastating is through prolonged solitary confinement.’ Prisoners in solitary confinement are often subject to incredibly harsh conditions that deteriorate their mental and physical condition resulting in a sort of ‘social death’ (Guenther 253). The practice of solitary confinement as it is executed today is a practice that is in need of major reform.” [/av_textblock] [/av_one_half] [av_one_half min_height=” vertical_alignment=” space=” custom_margin=” margin=’0px’ padding=’0px’ border=” border_color=” radius=’0px’ background_color=” src=” background_position=’top left’ background_repeat=’no-repeat’ animation=”] [av_image src=’http://coe.clemson.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/solitary-1030×579.png’ attachment=’4345′ attachment_size=’large’ align=’center’ styling=” hover=” link=’manually,https://slate.adobe.com/cp/hNBXe/’ target=’_blank’ caption=” font_size=” appearance=” overlay_opacity=’0.4′ overlay_color=’#000000′ overlay_text_color=’#ffffff’ animation=’no-animation’][/av_image] [/av_one_half] [av_section min_height=” min_height_px=’500px’ padding=’default’ shadow=’no-shadow’ bottom_border=’no-border-styling’ id=” color=’main_color’ custom_bg=’#f2f2f2′ src=” attachment=” attachment_size=” attach=’scroll’ position=’top left’ repeat=’no-repeat’ video=” video_ratio=’16:9′ overlay_opacity=’0.5′ overlay_color=” overlay_pattern=” overlay_custom_pattern=”] [av_one_half first min_height=” vertical_alignment=” space=” custom_margin=” margin=’0px’ padding=’0px’ border=” border_color=” radius=’0px’ background_color=” src=” background_position=’top left’ background_repeat=’no-repeat’ animation=”] [av_image src=’http://coe.clemson.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/religion-1030×579.png’ attachment=’4346′ attachment_size=’large’ align=’center’ styling=” hover=” link=’manually,https://slate.adobe.com/cp/AX5Mi/’ target=’_blank’ caption=” font_size=” appearance=” overlay_opacity=’0.4′ overlay_color=’#000000′ overlay_text_color=’#ffffff’ animation=’no-animation’][/av_image] [/av_one_half][av_one_half min_height=” vertical_alignment=” space=” custom_margin=” margin=’0px’ padding=’0px’ border=” border_color=” radius=’0px’ background_color=” src=” background_position=’top left’ background_repeat=’no-repeat’ animation=”] [av_textblock size=” font_color=” color=”] “Religious Beliefs Alter Our Lens of Perception” by Khayla Lloyd “As people interpret or misinterpret their holy text based on the religion they practice, it allows them to have opinions or perspectives on social issues. As the internet evolves and social media becomes a dominating factor in everyone’s life, the perspectives of race change as people begin to over-generalize races based on the religion they represent. Despite the religion people were raised in, religion can alter the perception of race and cause racial bias due to various beliefs and interpretations of their holy text and the ever-changing portrayed images of different religions that over-generalize specific races or ethnicities.” [/av_textblock] [/av_one_half] [/av_section] Posted on April 20, 2016April 21, 2016 Digital Creativity Scholar uses new technology to spread the word about writing development Anna Hall’s experience in the Digital Creativity Faculty Program has helped her incorporate new technology into her education. Anna Hall, a Center of Excellence Digital Creativity Scholar and assistant professor of early childhood education in Clemson University’s Eugene T. Moore School of Education, uses social media and Adobe products to spread the importance of early childhood writing. In a recent Digital Creativity Faculty workshop, Scholars learned how to use Adobe Post, Adobe Slate and Adobe Voice to create quick and effective stories from their iPhones and iPads. Hall spun the lesson into an Adobe Voice video of her own, “Every Child is a Writer,” which explains the importance of encouragement and freedom for young children’s writing development.
