Returning home after your time abroad can be both rewarding and challenging as you readjust to life in the U.S. - happy to be home but also missing your time abroad. You probably have a great deal of energy and excitement about the past few months and are ready to make something more of your incredible experiences. You may also be feeling a bit of reverse cultural adjustment as you try to readjust to life back in the States. Give yourself some time as you settle back into life in the U.S. and here in Coral Gables, reflect on your program and what you have learned. It is important to note that your study abroad experience does not have to end just because you've returned to the U.S. and to the U. There are numerous ways to integrate your international experience into campus life and beyond. Please review this section to learn about returning home, the global ambassadors, and activities on campus that can further international opportunities available to you.
