The Women’s and Gender Studies Program at Boston College takes an intersectional-based approach to the academic study of women’s and gender-focused issues in the United States and the world. Founded in 1983, WGS is one of the oldest interdisciplinary programs at Boston College. About the Women’s and Gender Studies Program The Women's and Gender Studies Program is an interdisciplinary forum for the study of women's past and present position in society. The concept of gender relations is considered a primary factor in our understanding of women's roles in various institutions and societies. The program analyzes the similarities and differences among women as a result of such factors as race, class, religion, and sexuality. The Women’s and Gender Studies Program is student-centered and holistically informed. Employing a transnational feminist pedagogical model, the WGS curriculum enables students to analyze gender and sexuality through lenses of identity and intersectionality. Students will learn not only how to critically explore issues of inequality and power in the classroom but will gain the tools to prudently engage with these topics beyond it. By successfully completing the program, students cultivate skills invaluable to their professional and personal success. Past alumni have gone onto illustrious careers in public policy, healthcare, law, and higher education, among others.
