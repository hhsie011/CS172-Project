Building on the goals achieved in its first sustainability plan, Columbia has developed this plan in conjunction with its own Earth Institute scientists and faculty, using guidance from the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to establish principles and measurable targets that will help ensure Columbia will achieve this goal. Achieving these targets requires an increased commitment across all areas of the University, and the ability to model sustainable values within every part of its culture – the way it educates, operates, designs, constructs, and manages resources.

The content in these areas was developed by sustainability planning working groups with faculty, student, and administrator participation. Campus Energy Achieve net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner, with an eye toward on-campus solutions. Sustainable Transportation Reduce emissions from on-campus fleet vehicles, commuters, and business travel. Responsible Design and Construction Ensure the design, construction, and refresh processes at all campuses support the University’s long-term goal to both decarbonize and achieve zero waste. Culture Change and Campus as Living Lab Commit to enhance student literacy and access to the campus as a living lab. Responsible Materials Management Send zero waste to landfill, host sustainable events, ensure retail tenant alignment, and practice sustainable procurement. Water Conservation and Capture Increase efforts toward water conservation, capture, and awareness.
