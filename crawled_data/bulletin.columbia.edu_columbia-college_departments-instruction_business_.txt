These courses, designed by Business School faculty specifically for undergraduates, build upon the strong liberal arts education at Columbia. Students learn how finance is directly connected to the fundamental principles of economics; that marketing utilizes concepts from psychology; and how management depends upon principles developed in psychology and sociology. Students can take advantage of the opportunity to enhance their experience by participating in co-curricular activities, such as Business School faculty lecture series, industry panels, informal mentoring/networking activities with MBA students and alumni, in addition to research opportunities with Business School faculty. This curricular and co-curricular programming capitalizes on the Business School’s ability to connect academic theory with real-world practice, providing students with the opportunity to develop key leadership skills, an entrepreneurial mindset, and the ability to innovate. Eligibility: To be eligible to earn a Special Concentration in Business Management, students must apply to the program in the spring semester of their sophomore or junior years, and they must be accepted through a process governed by the Columbia Business School. Beginning with the Special Concentration cohort of 2017-2018 (i.e., students accepted via the application process of Spring 2017), the program will accept up to 45 qualified candidates each year. The size of the program may be reviewed from time to time by Columbia College and Columbia Business School and adjusted, if desired by both schools. For students who entered Columbia College or General Studies in, or before, Fall 2016: Students who have not been accepted into the Special Concentration program may have the option to “shadow” the Special Concentration in Business Management by taking the required courses if space is available in those courses. Students who “shadow” the program will not be given priority registration in any courses that count toward the Special Concentration. If a student is able to take all of the courses and earns a 3.0 or higher grade-point average in the prerequisite, core, and elective courses, she or he will be allowed to declare retroactively the Special Concentration and have the program noted on their transcript. The shadowing option is no longer available for students who entered Columbia College or General Studies in, or after, Fall 2017.

This class is an introduction to strategic management and the decisions that firms make in their historical context. We look at the growth of the large multi-product firm in almost all countries in the world and the the process by which they internationalized their activities and, very often, were also forced to retreat from their international positions. We treat strategies as relation to two broad goals of the class: to understand why some companies are financially much more successful than others; and to analyze how managers can devise a set of actions (the strategy) and design processes and structures that allow their company to obtain a competitive advantage. You will learn the analytical tools developed in universities, in consulting and industrial firms, and even in the military. These tools include what companies do to outperform their rivals; to analyze the competitive moves of rival firms by game-theoretic concepts; and when it makes sense for companies to diversify and globalize their business. Applications will be to Walmart and Apple, European firms and to Asian firms, and developing country firms Spring 2022: BUSI UN3701 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment BUSI 3701 001/15534 T Th 8:40am - 9:55am 420 Kravis Hall Daniel Sands 3.00 60/65 BUSI UN3702 Venturing to Change the World. 3 points. How do founders and their new ventures change the world? Changes in technology and society are increasing the power of small teams to impact everything. Startups, large corporations, social groups and governments are increasingly focused on the power of innovation to solve the world’s hardest problems. The ideas and patterns driving this recent form of change-making build on frameworks defining the development of modern civilizations since the Renaissance. , Venturing to Change the World introduces the intellectual foundations and practical aspects of founding a new venture. We explore the entrepreneurial mindset, team formation, idea selection, how ideas become products with markets, and the key steps in building a venture. Our scope is commercial as well as social ventures, and the course is appropriate not only for prospective founders but anyone who will operate in a society increasingly animated by entrepreneurial activity.

Initially, the emphasis is on understanding the challenges confronting leaders and developing skills to effectively deal with these obstacles. Beyond intelligence and technical know-how, what separates effective leaders from other team members is a set of social skills (e.g. impression management, self-awareness). This course identifies these critical leadership skills and provides ideas and tools for improving them. Then, the course considers how social intelligence skills fit the needs of managers at different stages of their careers. In early stages, managers need to achieve a good person-job fit, find mentors, and build an effective social network. At the mid-career stage, managers need to lead an effective unit with increasing complexity and responsibilities. Finally, the course examines challenges managers face at later career stages as they become partners, CFOs, CEOs, etc. BUSI UN3704 Making History Through Venturing. 3 points.
