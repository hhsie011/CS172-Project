Whether you are looking for a part-time job, internship, volunteer experience, graduate school acceptance, or full-time work, you will most likely need to create and maintain strong professional documents in order to apply. Resumes are professional documents that introduce an employer to your skills, experiences, and professional history. Cover letters, on the other hand, are professional letters that provide an introduction to employers regarding your interest in a position (or in being considered for potential positions) and your perceived fit with a job and organization. The Career Center has both online tools and in-person assistance that can help you to develop your professional documents. Resume/Cover Letter Resources Available at The Career Center Career Advising Swing by The Career Center during drop-in advising for help creating a new resume/cover letter or to have a current document-in-progress critiqued.

These are available for you to review in the library from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.
