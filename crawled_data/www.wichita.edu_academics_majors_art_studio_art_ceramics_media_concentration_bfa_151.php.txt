Admission requirements Inside the Program Art student uses ceramics to craft future career As a student focusing on ceramics media, you will use your hands to express your creativity and past experiences. Mary Kathy Robb works with clay because she feels a connection to the medium. She says the transformative nature of ceramics reflects her as a person. She spends generous amounts of time in Henrion Hall, practicing hand-building techniques and exploring her passion for art through clay. Robb plans to secure a residency after graduation and continue to work on her ceramics. Curriculum The ceramics media concentration builds a breadth of knowledge of clay forming techniques—hand building, casting and throwing. It also fosters a working knowledge of the use of ceramics materials and methods, such as the use of slips and glazes, as well as firing processes including stoneware, wood-firing, soda-glazing and raku.
