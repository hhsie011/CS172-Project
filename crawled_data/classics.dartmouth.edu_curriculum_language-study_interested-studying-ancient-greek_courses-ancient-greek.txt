Normally offered in the Winter term, this course is designed to be followed immediately by GRK 3 in a two-term sequence. GRK 1.02/3.02 - Intensive Greek A double course (two time slots) covering both GRK 1 and GRK 3 in a single Spring term. Introduces all the basics of grammar and syntax and provides a gradual introduction to the reading of continuous texts. Satisfies the College language requirement. GRK 3 - Intermediate Greek Continued study of Greek grammar and syntax and an introduction to reading in prose authors. Normally offered in Spring term. Satisfies the College language requirement. Intermediate and Advanced Courses GRK 10 Readings in Greek Prose and Poetry For who have aleady studied the basics of the language. Readings drawn from Greek tragedy will illustrate foundational concepts of the culture. LIT, W GRK 20 Homer Reading in Greek and discussion of selections from the Iliad or Odyssey. Reading of the whole poem in translation and discussion of its character, style, and composition. LIT, W GRK 24 Theater A study of the tragedy and comedy of Classical Greece through detailed reading of at least one play of Aeschylus, Euripides, Sophocles, or Aristophanes. LIT, W GRK 26 Intellectual Enquiry in Classical Greece Explores the period of intellectual ferment and enquiry in fifth- and fourth-century Greek cities, when traditional beliefs came under scrutiny and many different figures laid claim to truth telling, from orators and sophists to poets and the practitioners of philosophy, history, and medicine. TMV, W GRK 28 Plato's Symposium A small-enrollment seminar offering an introduction to Plato's thought and to a rich vein of material illustrating Greek attitudes and assumptions on erotic love for both sexes. The primary text is Plato's Symposium, which we will study in the original language using an extraordinarily helpful study text by Louise Pratt (Eros at the Banquet). As time allows during the term, we will explore some of the rich body of evidence that exists in Greek poetry, oratory, and the visual arts either confirming or contradicting the impression given by Plato. TMV, W GRK 29 New Testament A brief introduction to the language, vocabulary, and idiom of New Testament Greek, followed by readings in the Gospels and in the Epistles of St. Paul. TMV, W GRK 30.07 The End of the World Studies Jewish and Christian apocalyptic literature produced in the Hellenistic era. These extraordinary texts, which portend a catastrophic end to the world, are notoriously difficult to interpret due to their fantastical imagery and cryptic symbolism. We will also examine the relationship of these texts to communities under duress.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Classics Curriculum Overview Course Offerings by Term Fall 2021 Winter 2022 Spring 2022 Summer 2022 Fall 2022 Winter 2023 Spring 2023 2023-24 Classical Studies Courses Entry points for Classical Studies Literature, Philosophy, Religion Ancient History Classical Archaeology Language Study -- Latin Latin Classes Placement in Latin Language Study -- Ancient Greek Courses in Ancient Greek Placement in Ancient Greek Majors and Minors Classical Studies track Ancient History track Classical Archaeology track Classical Languages and Literature track Culminating Experience Foreign Study NEW Classics FSP in Spring 2022 Greece Foreign Study Program Rome Foreign Study Program Projects & Awards Classics-Related Projects and Awards Student Research Archaeological Fieldwork Reid/Wiencke Funding for Research Senior Honors Projects Awards & Prizes Faculty Media Projects Annual Lecture Programs Faculty Books Inclusivity News & Events People Our graduates Graduating with a Classics Degree Alumni Support Tell Us Your Story Alumni Stories My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
