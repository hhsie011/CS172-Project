Since 1910 the UIL has grown into the largest inter-school organization of its kind in the world. UIL exists to provide educational extracurricular academic, athletic, and music contests. The initials UIL have come to represent quality educational competition administered by school people on an equitable basis. The earliest documentation identifying Texas Technological College as a host of a University Interscholastic League event was March 1938 in the 'Texas Tech Magazine: Engineering Edition'. Texas Tech University has since expanded its support of Texas public high school education by creating its own specialized unit (TTUIL) charged with administering a wide variety of UIL regional and invitational competitions, workshops, and summer camps. Mission of Texas Tech UIL Texas Tech UIL supports advancing the awareness of and increasing the enrollment of Texas Tech University by hosting UIL regional academic and athletic competitions which enable many of the top high school students from across the state the opportunity to visit the Texas Tech campus.
