Our clinical scientists not only treat patients, but are also working with basic scientists to pioneer novel treatments for psychiatric and neurological disease. Ongoing research aims to reverse brain aging, ease the devastating consequences of stroke, and develop non-invasive treatments to modulate brain activity associated with epilepsy and other neurological diseases. Breakthrough improvements in brain and mental health benefit not just individuals, but society as a whole.
