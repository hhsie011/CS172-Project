Overview Requirements Catalog Home > Undergraduate Majors, Certificates, Minors, Pre-Professional Study > Engineering > Energy Systems Minor Energy Systems Minor Energy systems are pervasive in our society. A list of energy-related subjects and applications in the engineering curriculum would be nearly endless, but here are some examples: • Mechanical engineers have a core area in thermo-fluids where courses in thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer form a base for energy systems. • Electrical engineers address power transmission and distribution as well as electric motors and power systems. • Civil engineers develop structures for wind turbines and hydroelectric dams. • Construction engineers need to understand how building systems impact energy utilization. • Chemical engineers develop alternative fuels and clean burning technologies. • Material engineers develop new materials for batteries and fuel cells. • Aerospace engineers develop wind turbines. • Industrial engineers address manufacturing efficiency and energy reduction. • Agricultural engineers develop biorenewable energy sources. Energy systems are also a significant focus of the grand challenges of engineering, and this minor will help our students address these issues in their engineering careers. The goal of the minor in energy systems is to provide ISU engineering students with focused educational opportunities in the broad area of energy systems. Successful energy systems minor students will understand broad energy perspectives, the language of energy systems, and the economic, environmental, and policy issues related to energy in the two required courses (six credits) for the minor (Econ 380 and EE 351 OR ME 433). Note that credit for both EE 351 and ME 433 is no longer accepted. The remaining nine credits in the minor can be selected from a list of approved engineering courses related to energy systems to give students the opportunity to extend their knowledge. The Energy Systems minor is administered by the mechanical engineering department and is open to all undergraduates in the College of Engineering. The minor may be earned by completing 15 credits from the following course list. The minor must include at least 9 credits that are not used to meet any other department, college, or university requirement. A complete list of approved elective courses can be found below.
