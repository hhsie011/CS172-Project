The majors in the Department of Computer Science provide students with the appropriate computer science background necessary for graduate study or a professional career. Computers impact nearly all areas of human endeavor. Therefore, the department also offers courses for students who do not plan a computer science major or concentration. The computer science majors offer maximum flexibility by providing students with a range of options for program specialization. The department offers four majors: computer science; information science; data science; and computer science-mathematics, offered jointly with the Mathematics Department. Computer Science Major Students study a common core of fundamental topics, supplemented by a track that identifies specific areas for deeper study. The foundations track prepares students for advanced work in fundamental, theoretical, and mathematical aspects of computing, including analysis of algorithms, scientific computing, and security. The systems track prepares students for immediate employment in the computer industry as well as advanced study in software engineering, operating systems, computer-aided digital design, computer architecture, programming languages, and user interfaces. The intelligent systems track provides specialization for the student interested in natural language processing and systems capable of exhibiting “human-like” intelligence. The applications track is for students interested in the implementation of interactive multimedia content for the Internet and wireless applications. The vision, graphics, interaction, and robotics track exposes students to computer vision, graphics, human-computer interaction, and robotics. A combination track is available to students who wish to pursue an interdisciplinary course of study combining computer science and another field in the arts, humanities, mathematics, natural sciences, or social sciences. A student planning a combination track should be aware that one additional course is required to complete this option. Information Science Major Information science is an interdisciplinary major designed to provide a student with an understanding of how information is organized, accessed, stored, distributed, and processed in strategic segments of today’s society. Recent years have seen an explosive growth of on-line information, with people of all ages and all walks of life making use of the World Wide Web and other information in digital form. This major puts students at the forefront of the information revolution, studying how on-line access touches on all disciplines and changing the very way people communicate. Organizations have large stores of in-house information that are crucial to their daily operation. Today’s systems must enable quick access to relevant information, must ensure that confidential information is secure, and must enable new forms of communication among people and their access to information. The information science major can choose a scientific focus on algorithms and systems for organizing, accessing, and processing information, or an interdisciplinary focus in order to develop an understanding of, and tools for, information modeling and use within an important sector of modern society such as economics or health. Advanced Placement The department grants 3 points for a score of 4 or 5 on the AP Computer Science exam along with exemption from COMS W1004 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Java. However, we still recommend that you take COMS W1004 or W1007 even if you have credits from the CS AP exam. COMS W1007 Honors Introduction to Computer Science is recommended if you scored 5 on the AP exam, and COMS W1004 is recommended if you scored 4. Pre-Introductory Courses COMS W1004 is the first course in the Computer Science major curriculum, and it does not require any previous computing experience. Before taking COMS W1004, however, students have an option to start with one of the pre-introductory courses: ENGI E1006 or COMS W1002. ENGI E1006 Introduction to Computing for Engineers and Applied Scientist is a general introduction to computing for STEM students. ENGI E1006 is in fact a required course for all engineering students. COMS W1002 Computing In Context is a course primarily intended for humanities majors, but it also serves as a pre-introductory course for CS majors. ENGI E1006 and COMS W1002 do not count towards Computer Science major. Laboratory Facilities The department has well-equipped lab areas for research in computer graphics, computer-aided digital design, computer vision, databases and digital libraries, data mining and knowledge discovery, distributed systems, mobile and wearable computing, natural language processing, networking, operating systems, programming systems, robotics, user interfaces, and real-time multimedia. Research labs contain several large Linux and Solaris clusters; Puma 500 and IBM robotic arms; a UTAH-MIT dexterous hand; an Adept-1 robot; three mobile research robots; a real-time defocus range sensor; interactive 3-D graphics workstations with 3-D position and orientation trackers; prototype wearable computers, wall-sized stereo projection systems; see-through head-mounted displays; a networking testbed with three Cisco 7500 backbone routers, traffic generators; an IDS testbed with secured LAN, Cisco routers, EMC storage, and Linux servers; and a simulation testbed with several Sun servers and Cisco Catalyst routers.The department uses a SIP IP phone system. The protocol was developed in the department. The department's computers are connected via a switched 1Gb/s Ethernet network, which has direct connectivity to the campus OC-3 Internet and internet 2 gateways. The campus has 802.11b/g wireless LAN coverage. The research facility is supported by a full-time staff of professional system administrators and programmers. Professors Alfred V. Aho Peter K.

Students considering a major in computer science are encouraged to talk to a program adviser during their first or second year. A typical program of study is as follows: Program of Study Computer Science Core (22-26 points). Adjustments were made to the course lists below in March 2022. For students who declare in Spring 2014 and beyond: Course List Code Title Points ENGI E1006 INTRO TO COMP FOR ENG/APP SCI (recommended but not required) First Year COMS W1004 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Java or COMS W1007 Honors Introduction to Computer Science Sophomore Year COMS W3134 Data Structures in Java or COMS W3137 Honors Data Structures and Algorithms COMS W3157 Advanced Programming COMS W3203 DISCRETE MATHEMATICS Junior and Senior Year Select the remaining required core courses: COMS W3261 Computer Science Theory CSEE W3827 Fundamentals of Computer Systems Select one of the following courses: COMS W3251 COMPUTATIONAL LINEAR ALGEBRA (recommended) MATH UN2010 LINEAR ALGEBRA MATH UN2020 Honors Linear Algebra APMA E2101 INTRO TO APPLIED MATHEMATICS APMA E3101 APPLIED MATH I: LINEAR ALGEBRA STAT GU4001 INTRODUCTION TO PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS For students who declared prior to Spring 2014: Course List Code Title Points First Year COMS W1004 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Java Sophomore Year COMS W1007 Honors Introduction to Computer Science COMS W3137 Honors Data Structures and Algorithms COMS W3157 Advanced Programming COMS W3203 DISCRETE MATHEMATICS Junior and Senior Year COMS W3261 Computer Science Theory CSEE W3827 Fundamentals of Computer Systems In addition to the CS Core (22-26 points), all CS majors must complete the Calculus Requirement (3 points) and a Track Requirement (15 or 18 points). The CS major therefore requires 40-47 points total. Mathematics (3 points) Calculus II or Calculus III. Note that Calculus III does NOT depend on Calculus II. You can take either Calculus II or III, but we recommend Calculus III, which covers topics that are a bit more relevant for upper-level Computer Science courses. If you have received equivalent credits for Calculus I & II already (through a 4 or 5 on the AP Calculus exam for example), you are not required to take any more Calculus courses. But we recommend taking one more semester of Calculus, either Math UN1201 Calculus III or APAM E2000 Multivariate Calculus for Engineers and Scientists. APAM E2000 covers relevant topics from Calculus III and IV. Track Requirement (15 or 18 points) Students must select one of the following six upper-level tracks. Each track, except the combination track, requires five courses consisting of required, elective breadth, and elective track courses. The combination track requires a selection of six advanced courses: three 3000- or 4000-level computer science courses and three 3000- or 4000-level courses from another field. The elective breadth requirement in each track can be fulfilled with any 3-point computer science 3000-level or higher course that is not a computer science core course or a technical elective course in that track. In addition to the breadth elective, the track requirements are as follows: Foundations Track (15 points) For students interested in algorithms, computational complexity, and other areas of theoretical Computer Science. Note: Students who declared their Computer Science major prior to Fall 2016 may also count COMS 4241, COMS 4205, COMS 4281, COMS 4444, COMS 4771, and COMS 4772 as track elective courses.
