Our Capacity to Help Government and Industry The areas spanned by the Center capture trends in data science for which there is tremendous current Cornell strength; leveraging this, the Center should play a leading role in Coordinating faculty renewal (especially cross-unit hires, focusing on tenured appointments in Statistics and Data Sciences (SDS), Operations Research and Information Engineering (ORIE), Information Science (IS), Computer Science (CS), Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), Economics, and Mathematics); Administering an Assistant Research Professorship program; Coordinating internal proposal-driven thematic boot camps (off-term); Coordinating and playing a lead role in responding to inter- and intra-institutional external funding opportunities (e.g., the multi-institution TRIPODS NSF Data Science Institute, and outreach to foundations such as the Simons Foundation); Coordinating the engagement of industrial and government partners in data science; Coordinating the development of a Ph.D. field of Data Science, initially focusing on a Ph.D. minor; Coordinating with Center for Advanced Computing (CAC) to address issues of data archiving and research computing; Interfacing with the data-infused aspects of other radical collaborations (primarily digital agriculture, genome biology, sustainability, and infection biology).
