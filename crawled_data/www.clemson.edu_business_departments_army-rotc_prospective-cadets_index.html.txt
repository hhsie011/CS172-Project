Army ROTC (Reserve Officers' Training Corps) is one of the smartest college courses you can take. It offers opportunities and challenges that can put you on the fast track to success in life. You'll develop the confidence, self-esteem, motivation and leadership skills you'll need regardless of your career plans. The qualities that ROTC training instills will be vital to a productive and rewarding future. ROTC is an elective course that provides a combination of academics and important hands-on training. You'll be offered physical and mental challenges geared to help you succeed in college and beyond. You will learn teamwork and be given responsibilities like teaching younger cadets the same skills you have learned. In addition to our on-campus training, we offer instruction in adventure training like mountaineering, rappelling and orienteering. For its many benefits, Army ROTC requires only a few hours a week. So it won't interfere with your required college curriculum or social life. In fact, you'll find ROTC a great place to form lasting friendships. If you want to build a solid, well-rounded future, take a closer look at Army ROTC. What it means to be an Army Officer: Being an officer in the U.S. Army means you're a leader, a counselor, a strategist and a motivator. It's similar to being a vital manager in a corporation. As an officer, you will lead other Soldiers in all situations and adjust in environments that are always changing. You are driven to achieve success with your team on every mission.
