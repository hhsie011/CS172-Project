We will explore a range of media—including architecture, painting, sculpture, textiles, and photography—to ask critical questions about the nature of images and their relationship to emotions, the environment, devotion, politics, performance, and other art forms, like literature, music, and dance. The course will include regular visits to the RISD museum (A) HIAA 0023 S01 Primary Instructor Shaffer HIAA 0023 C01 Schedule Code C: Discussion Section/Conference HIAA 0023 C02 Schedule Code C: Discussion Section/Conference HIAA 0023 C03 Schedule Code C: Discussion Section/Conference HIAA 0023 C04 Schedule Code C: Discussion Section/Conference Introduction to Architectural Design Studio Introduces students to basic tools and strategies in architectural design. A number of exercises will introduce students to questions about form, function and structure and teach them to learn from close observation of the built environment. The second half of the semester is devoted to the design of a small house by each student, which will be presented in a scale model and a full set of drawings at the end of the semester. A jury of invited architects and professors will conduct a discussion of each project. Enrollment limited to 15. Course is intended for first and second year students. HIAA 0100 S01 Class located in Arnold Lab 317 Primary Instructor Von Der Schulenburg Architectural Projection This course introduces the beginning student to the origins, media, geometries and role(s) of projection drawing in the design and construction process. The student will learn systems of projection drawing from direct experience, and be challenged to work both from life and to life. Subjects such as transparency, figure/ground, sciagraphy, oblique projection, surface development, volumetric intersections, spatial manipulation and analytic operations will build on the basics of orthographic and conic projection. The course involves line and tone drawing, hand drafting, computer drawing(Autocad) and computer modeling(Rhino). HIAA 0130 S01 class taught in Arnold Lab room 317 Primary Instructor Von Der Schulenburg Architectural Analysis This course will develop one's ability to critically read and understand architecture through formal, geometric, tectonic and spatial analytic processes. Analysis acts as an intermediary between observation, expression, and understanding, offering deep insights into works of architecture. The course builds upon the processes introduced in Architectural Projection. Through various conceptual and representational frameworks, the issues of mapping-layers. Point of view, scale, morphology, topography and tectonics will be explored as part of a larger creative process, embracing visual imagination, communication and critique. HIAA 0140 S01 Class will be held at 50 John Street Primary Instructor Rowen Intermediate Architectural Design Studio This course will consider issues related to architecture, urban design, and public space. Using the city of Providence as a field of exploration we will examine the cultural, environmental, and political forces which shape the relationships between buildings and urban landscapes. We will utilize various two and three dimensional graphic techniques to analyze and reimagine public spaces, and their constituent sites, buildings, and programs. Our work will help you gain greater fluency with the designer's "tools", e.g. models and drawings and the iterative processes through which designers represent conditions of site, program, tectonics, and materiality to create architectural form and urban space. HIAA 0150 S01 Class to be taught in Pembroke Field House, second floor Primary Instructor Barton Pilgrimage Art and Architecture in the Middle Ages From Santiago de Compostela to Jerusalem, the movement of religious pilgrims in the Middle Ages resulted in a rich variety of architectural spaces and material culture. The growth of the cult of relics, and the pilgrims that visited them, fueled the development of the urban landscape and religious practices across the medieval world. This course explores the roots and routes of pilgrimage, focusing on the sacred relics that attracted them and the development of architectural spaces they visited. We will examine not only the art and architectural traditions related to pilgrimage in western Europe but the deep connections and exchange of art and architecture in Byzantine, Jewish and Islamic traditions. (a) HIAA 0432 S01 Primary Instructor Kinias HIAA 0432 C01 Primary Instructor Kinias Schedule Code C: Discussion Section/Conference Architecture and Urbanism of Africa This course introduces African built environments from the earliest known examples to the contemporary moment. Through recent debates about heritage and preservation, we will interrogate “Africa” as both an imagined construct and a concrete geographic entity characterized by diverse cultures, contexts, and histories. We will also explore competing interpretations of Africa’s architectural and urban history and their contemporary relevance. Weekly one-hour section required. A HIAA 0770 S01 Primary Instructor Osayimwese HIAA 0770 C01 Schedule Code C: Discussion Section/Conference HIAA 0770 C02 Schedule Code C: Discussion Section/Conference Art and Technology from Futurism to Hacktivism This course will introduce students to the central role of technological media in art of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. From telephones to computers, the Sony Portapak to the Internet, artists have creatively engaged technology to transform how their art was made, circulated, and received. We will pay equal attention to technology as a medium and the ways artists responded to broader technological change. Looking at works from Europe, the Americas, and Japan, we will interrogate the varying social conditions and political motivations that drove artists to use technology in order to radically change the making and meaning of art. HIAA 0820 S01 Primary Instructor Caplan HIAA 0820 C01 Schedule Code C: Discussion Section/Conference HIAA 0820 C02 Schedule Code C: Discussion Section/Conference HIAA 0820 C04 Schedule Code C: Discussion Section/Conference HIAA 0820 C05 Schedule Code C: Discussion Section/Conference Contemporary Architecture Stylistic, technological, and theoretical developments in architecture from the 1960s to the present. Analyzes movements such as "Brutalism," "Postmodernism," and "Deconstruction" and works by architects such as Frank Gehry, I. M. Pei, and Zaha Hadid. Emphasizes the complex conditions of architectural production in different parts of the world. Complements HIAA 0850, but may be taken independently.

It is organized in ‘archaeological’ order: from the most recent to the oldest. We will examine case studies, beginning with Tadao Ando’s Water Temple and Frank Lloyd Wright’s Fallingwater. We will examine the local examples of Slater Mill, the Blackstone River, and Barnaby Evans’ Waterfire. We will then look back at historical examples: the Hoover Dam, the creation of Venice and the Grand Canal of China, the fountains at Versailles, the Islamic gardens at Isfahan, the medieval hydraulic plan for Canterbury Cathedral, and the Roman aqueduct bridge of the Pont du Gard. One of the principal aims of the course is to place the discussion of design into historical, technological and environmental contexts, and to provide students with experience in the production of architectural projects HIAA 1101C S01 Primary Instructor Bonde Illustrating Indigenous Knowledge in European Print This seminar examines the transatlantic politics of publishing indigenous knowledge. In early modern Europe, pictorial prints codified paradigm shifts in geography, ecology, and medicine. Knowledge of newly conquered lands appeared in books illustrated by artists who, often, had never visited the places they pictured. Meanwhile in the Americas, indigenous and creole artists appealed to experienced printmakers and publishers in Europe while building resources and artisanal knowledge among local printmakers. How did the power dynamics of coloniality shape the way knowledge of indigenous peoples was codified? We will answer this question through study of illustrated books in special collections at Brown. HIAA 1411 S01 Primary Instructor Monty The Body and the Senses in Medieval Art The seminar considers the contradictory aspects of embodiment in the visual and material culture of the Middle Ages. We will examine the veneration of holy bodies through living holy individuals, and through body parts (relics) and the Eucharist enshrined in sumptuous containers. We will look at the iconography of death and resurrection, the representation of the body in painting and sculpture, attitudes toward sexuality, the performance of identity through clothing, and the sumptuary laws that governed clothing and behavior. We will investigate funerary rituals and burial, and the movement of living bodies in dance and in civic and religious processions. A HIAA 1440E S01 Primary Instructor Bonde Real and Unreal Landscapes This seminar is about how artists imagine the land, and the relationship between people and the places that they inhabit. We will think broadly about how people have conceptualized “nature,” the “landscape,” and “colonization” from the eighteenth century to today as well as hone in on specific artistic traditions, including those in Africa, Europe, and South Asia and across the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans. This class will investigate materials that come from the land, such as oil, clay, and pigments; other aspects of the environment, like waterways and clouds; and other art forms, including music, fiction, and dance. A HIAA 1721 S01 Primary Instructor Shaffer Indigenous Art, Issues and Concepts This seminar will map out the field of indigenous art with an emphasis on artworks from English-speaking settler colonial countries, concentrating on Native North American and Aboriginal Australian artists. We will approach indigenous art theoretically, outlining major issues and concepts of this global topic. Units will include defining indigeneity and indigenous art terms, anthropology in relation to art, and curatorial practice. We will begin by addressing the concept of indigeneity through legal and sociopolitical frameworks, continuing with museological display of indigenous art across time, and seeing how museums are working to better contextualize their anthropological collections.

HIAA 2721 S01 This is an UG/Grad seminar Primary Instructor Shaffer Pattern Recognition: Analogies of Creativity and Perception This graduate seminar will examine the history of pattern recognition with a focus on how the idea has been mobilized to understand human creativity and visual perception. Topics will include late 19th-century experimental psychology and theories of perception, formalist methods of art history, early twentieth-century abstraction, psychoanalysis, cybernetic theory, generative art, conspiracy theories, 20th- and 21st-century conceptions of artificial intelligence and machine cognition. Our inquiry will be interdisciplinary and comparative. Weaving our way through contrasting case studies and an array of interdisciplinary fields, we will focus on the historical reasons that pattern recognition came to be such a dominant analogy for conceiving of the human and how and why it has shaped artistic practice, art historical methods, and technological design.
