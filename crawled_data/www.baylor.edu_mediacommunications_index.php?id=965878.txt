The asymptomatic tumor was found during a routine wellness examination with veterinarians at Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences. Lady has received treatment at Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital with a low-dose TomoTherapy System, a state-of-the-art treatment system that targets tumors while minimizing exposure of radiation to surrounding healthy tissues and causing fewer side effects compared to conventional forms of radiation therapy. Veterinarians continue to closely monitor the tumor, which has not grown since it was discovered. Lady lives at her campus home – the Bill and Eva Williams Bear Habitat – along with her older sister, Joy. Additional Media Resources Dec. 11, 2019 Letter to the Baylor Family from President Linda A.
