Students who are enterprising, organized, and on top of it have been able to graduate in three years for a long time and we felt it was important to support those students—provide greater guidance, a little more structure, and better advice along the way to help them achieve this goal.” —Jay Howard, Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.
