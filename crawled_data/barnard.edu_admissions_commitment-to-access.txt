Over one hundred and thirty years later, Barnard is still rewriting the narrative of inequity by working to remove barriers of access to historically underrepresented groups. Over 40% of Barnard students identify as students of color, and 16% are the first in their family to attend college. In addition to a plethora of supportive programs, our Council on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion continues to create strategies to promote equity throughout our beloved community. “A diversity of lived experiences and viewpoints in an environment that allows for open dialogue and understanding is vital to our scholarship.” —Sian Leah Beilock, President of Barnard College Access & Support Programs Barnard is dedicated to recognizing academic excellence and leadership in students from all backgrounds. To that end, the College offers a variety of access programs for eligible students who have the spirit, drive, curiosity, and motivation that all Barnard students share. Opportunity Programs (HEOP/BOP/CSTEP) As an Opportunity Program scholar, you’ll be part of a small community that receives extra mentorship through all four years and beyond Barnard. From peer and faculty mentoring to book vouchers and computer loans, we help you find your way and discover your true capabilities. Science Pathways Scholars Program (SP)2 Scholars benefit from an exceptional set of opportunities and resources, including four years of science faculty mentorship, paid summer research opportunities, and a week-long, expenses-paid trip to campus in the summer to meet science faculty and tour research facilities and departments. Special Funding for Undocumented and DACA Students Barnard College seeks to enroll the intellectual thinkers and leaders of tomorrow, regardless of citizenship status. Since 2015, the College has provided undocumented young women of promise with full financial support. Are You Barnard Bound? Barnard Bound provides a taste of Barnard College and New York City for promising rising high school seniors who self-identify as students of color — especially those students who couldn’t otherwise afford to visit. During this two-day overnight program, you’ll be able to experience the cultural diversity of New York City and Morningside Heights while getting a full perspective on life as a potential Barnard student. A current student will host you in a campus residence hall. Learn more about Barnard Bound Identity and Inclusion Initiatives We recognize that personal exploration into our intersectional identities allows all students to feel empowered to live unapologetically. Our identity and inclusion programs allow students to come together with their peers, faculty, and staff to explore their identities and to build networks of support and solidarity. Student of Color Initiatives From Heritage Month programs to our Students of Color Leadership Retreat, Barnard students of color are able to explore the richness of their ethnic and cultural backgrounds and histories. First-Generation/Low-Income Initatives Through the Student Success Program, the First-Generation/Low-Income Program (FGLI) at Barnard is committed to providing resources and support to all students who identify with the first-generation and/or low-income college experience. LGBTQIA Initiatives Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, and allied communities on campus come together through a variety of programs to celebrate and empower each other. Social Justice Programs We all are responsible for building an equitable and inclusive community. Through Barnard’s social justice initiatives, you’ll be empowered to contribute to the conversation, lead, build community, and be an agent for social change. Barnard BLUE Leadership Series The Barnard BLUE Series includes a variety of programming aimed at engaging students in intentional dialogues to explore their identities and what it means to foster inclusive communities. Barnard Equity in Action A two-part series open to students, faculty, and staff that builds skills and deepens knowledge around issues of social justice.
