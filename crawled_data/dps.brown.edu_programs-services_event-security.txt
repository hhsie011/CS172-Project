DPS Event Review Policy The Brown University Department of Public Safety (DPS) is responsible for providing police and security services on campus and for coordinating and determining police and security staffing at all events on campus such as parties, dances, rallies, lectures, dignitary visits, sporting events, etc., including those events/functions sponsored by non-university organizations. Adequate security and crowd management are integral aspects of event planning and all event sponsors and organizers (i.e., student organizations, departments, students, faculty and staff) share in the responsibility for the safety and well-being of audience members, participants, performers, and workers. Our DPS Staffing Policy for Campus Events & Construction Projects offers detailed information for you to consider when planning for event security. How to Notify the DPS About Your Event DPS created a Security Event Review Form to help determine whether a security detail is needed for your event. Requests for Public Safety Staffing for events should be made as far in advance as possible and must be submitted on-line, at least three weeks prior to the event. The following questions are examples of what will be asked on the form: Location, Date, and Time of Event Event Name, Speakers, Topics Is the Event Open To The Public, Alcohol, or Cash Exchanged For further assistance during business hours, Monday through Friday 8:30 am – 5:00pm, please contact dps_details@brown.edu or call Jillian Rourke at 863-2027.

Take Care of Your Special Guests Fill out a Dignitary Notification Form to alert appropriate campus departments of high profile visitors coming to the Brown campus. Not Sure?
