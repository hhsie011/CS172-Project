(Ithaca) Field of Study Comparative Biomedical Sciences Program Description The Master of Professional Studies (MPS) with a concentration in Veterinary Parasitology is a unique degree program in the country. It combines comprehensive coursework in specialty topics, clinically oriented hands-on labs, and a capstone research project to provide rigorous training in all aspects of parasitology at one of the nation’s top Colleges of Veterinary Medicine. This program is designed for individuals who seek to enhance their careers with advanced practical training in veterinary parasitology. Working professionals are encouraged to take advantage of the flexible nature of the program, which can be completed in one year or over a longer period of time. Graduates of the MPS program will be leaders in the field and will be highly competitive for positions in industry, federal and state government, and academia.

In addition, important component of the program is developing the student’s understanding of the role of government agencies in animal health and the interactions required with such agencies with respect to parasite prevention, treatment, and control. With this base of knowledge it is expected that upon completion of the program, students will be able to: Demonstrate an understanding of scientific principles related to parasitic organisms and diseases of animals. Utilize acquired proficiencies for the investigation of familiar and unfamiliar parasitic infections in differing animal husbandry conditions. Apply scientific knowledge in acquiring new abilities and in making decisions about changes in clinical protocols and procedures, product development and testing, and appropriate product use. Describe the differences between clinical trials and observational studies including advantages and disadvantages of each. Assess the value of several secondary measures which can be used to monitor progression of parasite-induced disease (e.g. radiographs for heartworm induced disease, anemia for haemonchosis, or plasma pepsinogen levels for ostertagiasis). Perform and interpret results of diagnostic procedures. Interpret test results in a way that shows understanding of prior probabilities, test accuracy and predictive values. Plan and communicate preventive medicine programs (e.g. vaccination) addressing host immunity, and environmental or management risk factors. Read scientific publications related to parasitic infections and evaluate validity of conclusions. Select appropriate diagnostic tests to monitor product efficacy. Evaluate management factors for controlling the presence, maintenance and distribution of ectoparasites and nuisance arthropods in live stock. Understand principles of infectious disease transmission including routes of transmission, herd immunity, and pathogen characteristics that influence propagation and survival. Describe the requirements for product development and government approval, and explain the role of government agencies in the approval process. Describe the requirements for adequate data collection and recording under quality assurance standards necessary for report submission to government agencies. Formulate project reports that are in compliance with quality assurance standards. Devise and generate protocols to present for new product development or approval. Develop a thorough understanding of pharmacological concepts, research, trails, and production as well as anthelmintic development, mode of action, approval, treatment, and resistance Appreciate the diversity of parasite life cycles and across taxa and their role as targets for control and treatment Work collaboratively in groups on projects and papers. Become adept at discussing, writing about, and synthesizing a range of veterinary topics. Prepare and execute high quality oral presentations with visual aids, including the improvement of the student's ability to effectively and tactfully respond to audience questions. Effectively conduct a search of the primary literature. Prepare an annotated bibliography and write abstracts for research papers. Write an in-depth review paper. Interact collaboratively with experts in veterinary sciences. Develop professionalism skills and qualities.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
