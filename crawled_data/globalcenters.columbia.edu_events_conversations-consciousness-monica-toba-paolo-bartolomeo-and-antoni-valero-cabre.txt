What is attention? Can we pay attention and be conscious while we sleep? If you are interested in the answers to these questions, join us for Conversations on Consciousness, a series of discussions hosted by Columbia University Professor Alfredo Spagna and Columbia Global Centers | Paris. Professor Spagna will speak with internationally recognized scientists from the Paris Brain Institute on the most recent discoveries in neuroscience, detailing how the brain makes us who we are! Join researchers Monica Toba, Paolo Bartolomeo, and Antoni Valero Cabré on June 15 for the first conversation in the series. They will be discussing their work and how it relates to consciousness: Monica Toba: Neural systems of attention and consciousness I investigate the physical substrates of attention and consciousness by using the model of visuospatial neglect. Spatial neglect typically affects left-sided events after right hemisphere damage with an impact on complex cognitive activities such as attention and consciousness. My work focuses on the neural systems responsible for such activities, their disruptions in pathology, as well as their role in rehabilitation. Paolo Bartolomeo: Patterns of hemispheric asymmetry in visual consciousness Large-scale brain networks, with asymmetries favoring the right hemisphere, are important to direct attention in space, and to make us aware of unexpected external events. Other brain regions in the left hemisphere appear to support perceptual decisions on near-threshold targets, or to sustain voluntary visual mental imagery. The challenge is now to build a model of visual consciousness that keeps in proper account these hemispheric asymmetries.
