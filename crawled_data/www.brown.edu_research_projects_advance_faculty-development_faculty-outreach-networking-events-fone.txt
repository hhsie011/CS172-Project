FONE is a monthly meeting of (women and men) faculty, administrators, and staff. Each session begins with a brief presentation on one of a range of faculty development topics (grantseeking, leadership development, communicating science, etc.) followed by an opportunity to network with Brown colleagues. Sessions are from 8:30-9:30 AM (presentations begin promptly at 8:45 AM). All of this semester's sessions are held in the General Study Room at the new Science Center, located on the 3rd floor of the Science Library. Light refreshments are provided. Previous Sessions Topic Date Description Raising Your Research Profile with ResearcherID Oct 2010 This month we demo ResearcherID, available through the University Library. ResearcherID provides the global research community with an index to author information. By assigning a unique identifier to each author who participates, ResearcherID standardizes and clarifies author names and citations and makes your information search more straightforward and accessible. Search the registry to find collaborators, review publication lists, and explore how research is used around the world. Use ResearcherID authentication in Web of Knowledge to create automatic email alerts or RSS feeds for saved searches or article citations. For additional information on raising your research profile, see our wiki. Grantseeking through Community of Science (COS) Sept 2010 Our topic this month is the funding opps database, Community of Science (COS). COS Funding Opportunities is a frequently updated database of funding opportunity announcements from across the disciplines (including the humanities and social sciences). It contains information on awards, fellowships, and grants from federal/non-federal, corporate/private foundation, and international funding sources. COS Funding Alert is a weekly e-mail notification with a customized list of funding opportunities based on specified criteria provided by the individual COS member. For additional information, see the University Library Grant Resources Guide. News Media & You Apr 2010 We have two great presenters this month on the topic of communicating science to the news media: 1. Richard Lewis, Science Media Specialist, presents strategies for communicating effectively with the news media about your research and scientific breakthroughs. See his presentation here. 2. Professor Meenakshi Narain, Physics, talks about the May 5 Media Training Event being held as part of the ADVANCE-sponsored US Compact Muon Solenoid Collaboration meeting.
