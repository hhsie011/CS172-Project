Contact UW-IT About UW-IT Participate in pilots of new technologies Background Participant eligibility Completed educational technology pilots Background UW-IT’s Academic Experience Design & Delivery unit provides ad hoc evaluation and assessment of digital learning tools that are designed to meet campus needs. Instructors, students, and staff are important partners in this work; feedback from users is critical to our decision-making process and helps us to inform vendors about where their products do or do not yet meet expectations. Whether or not we recommend a technology for adoption and central support depends in part on The breadth of the potential audience for the tool How well the technology meets user needs How easy it is to use and support How well it meets UW’s accessibility standards The cost of adoption Each year, AXDD chooses a limited number of technologies to pilot test and evaluate. While requirements for participation may vary, all pilot participants are asked to provide feedback on their experience, typically through focus groups or short surveys distributed by UW-IT. Participant eligibility We encourage interested faculty and staff to test our selected technologies and provide feedback. Because pilot agreements with vendors often mean we are limited in the number of users we can enroll, we seek participants who can make a firm commitment to: Participate in or watch a short “getting started” webinar about the tool Explore and test multiple features of the tool Provide feedback at the end of the quarter Invite and make time for students to provide feedback Our goal is to create a vibrant community of early adopters who inspire one another with their teaching experiments (we enthusiastically welcome participants who want to share examples of how they used the tool in their course) and, where needed, inform the development of new features. We share what we learn from pilot participants with the vendor so that the technology can be improved and better meet user needs. Technology pilots for 2022-23 Stay tuned for information about technology pilots we will be conducting in 2022-23. Completed educational technology pilots Ed Discussion Ed Discussion is a broadly applicable tool for asynchronous, threaded discussion. In particular, this tool supports Q&A (peer to peer with instructor endorsement of answers) and offers features for moderation and templated posts and replies. Based on feedback we collected from instructors and students during spring, summer and autumn 2021, as well as consideration of additional evaluation criteria, UW-IT will add Ed Discussion to its collection of centrally supported tools for teaching and learning in summer 2022. Read a summary of the Ed Discussion pilot and evaluation results Read the summer/autumn 2021 Ed Discussion survey report Harmonize Harmonize is a broadly applicable tool that offers discussion, Q&A and live 1:1 or group chat. Based on feedback we collected from instructors and students during spring, summer and autumn 2021, as well as consideration of additional evaluation criteria, UW-IT will not be adding Harmonize to its collection of centrally supported tools. Departments are free to contract with the vendor individually. Read a summary of the Harmonize pilot and evaluation results Read the summer/autumn 2021 Harmonize summary report Hypothesis Hypothesis is an online collaborative annotation tool integrated with Canvas that supports shared annotations, discussion in response to annotations, and active reading of text. Based on feedback we collected from instructors and students from autumn 2020-spring 2021, as well as accessibility reviews of the technology and the responsiveness of the vendor to feedback, UW-IT added Hypothesis to its collection of centrally-supported tools for teaching and learning in autumn 2021.
