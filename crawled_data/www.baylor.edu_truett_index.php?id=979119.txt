Truett Seminary>Admissions>Tuition & Financing>Scholarships>Scholarship FAQ Scholarship FAQ Scholarships 1. What scholarships are available for Truett students? Incoming students who attend a Baptist church and current students who attend a Baptist General Convention of Texas (BGCT) church are eligible to receive a Baptist Student Scholarship. Please see FAQ #6 for additional details. A number of competitive full tuition and partial tuition scholarships are available. Baylor University will match on a dollar-for-dollar basis, not to exceed $1,000 in an academic year, scholarship funds given to Baptist students from a Baptist church, state Baptist convention or Baptist-affiliated program. Additional scholarship opportunities may also be available. Please contact Truett Scholarships Services at truett_financial@baylor.edu. 2. How many full tuition scholarships are awarded? The number of full tuition scholarships available varies from year to year depending upon funds available. 3. I missed the priority deadline for the full tuition scholarship. Should I still apply? Yes, but you must apply before the final deadline. No scholarship applications will be accepted after the final deadline. 4. What costs are covered by the full tuition competitive scholarship? The full tuition competitive scholarship covers tuition costs. The student will still be responsible for expenses outside of tuition, including books, housing, and insurance (required for international students). View a breakdown of all estimated costs using the Cost of Attendance Calculator provided by Baylor Student Financial Services. 5. How do I apply for multiple full tuition scholarships? I qualify for more than one! By completing the Truett Scholarship Application, a student will be considered for all competitive scholarships for which he or she qualifies. The student only needs to complete this single application, no matter how many scholarships for which he or she qualifies. 6. How do I qualify for the Baptist Student Scholarship? Incoming students who are a member of any Baptist church may initially qualify for the Baptist Student Scholarship and may have their church sign off on the Baptist Church Certification Form. In subsequent years, in order to continue to receive the Baptist Student Scholarship, students must be involved with a Baptist General Convention of Texas (BGCT), or Texas Baptists, church and have that church sign off on the Baptist Church Certification Form. 7. Can I apply for a competitive full tuition scholarship after I have started my time at Truett? No, the competitive full and partial tuition scholarship application is only open to incoming students.
