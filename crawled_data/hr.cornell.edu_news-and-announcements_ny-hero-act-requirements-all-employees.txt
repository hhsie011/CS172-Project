Since that communication, Governor Hochul has designated COVID-19 a highly contagious communicable disease that presents a serious risk of harm to the public health under the new act. This designation requires the university to implement additional measures beyond those currently in place. Accordingly, all Cornell employees are required to: Beginning Monday, Sept. 20, complete the Daily Check health assessment each day prior to arriving on campus or accessing Cornell facilities. (This daily health assessment process was previously in place.) Complete CULearn course: EHS2021 HERO ACT Designation of COVID-19 as an airborne infectious disease compliance training by October 15, 2021. The course is available and will be auto-assigned in CULearn early next week. All health and safety requirements in place to combat the spread of COVID-19 can be found on the university’s COVID-19 Response website. For more information, regarding the NY HERO Act and airborne disease mitigation, please review the university’s Airborne Infectious Agents plan. Sincerely, Tim Fitzpatrick Senior Director, Environment, Health, Safety and Emergency Management Allan Bishop Associate Vice President, Human Resources John D.
