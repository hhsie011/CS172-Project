On This Page Mission & Goals Initiatives DEI Committee Members Humans of Thayer Project Annual Reports Mission & Goals Mission: A Thayer that embodies openness, accessibility, collaboration, and human-centered innovation, that elevates the voices of those from historically marginalized backgrounds, and continually works towards a community that comes together across differences as we respond to the challenges in our world. "Our goal is to build a community that reflects the rich diversity of the global workforce, and create a culture in which our individual identities and contributions are valued and treated with respect. It's critical that each student, faculty, and staff feel welcome and included to ensure we teach, learn, and discover to our full potential." —Alexis Abramson, Dean Goals As part of the larger Dartmouth Action Plan for Inclusive Excellence, the engineering community at Dartmouth aims to: Invest in the initiatives that prioritize equity and access by giving deliberate attention to the recruitment, retention, or training hurdles that limit the participation of individuals from historically marginalized groups. Improve the health and well-being of our community through organizing resources and programming that meet the specific needs of diverse groups and create a culture where skill-sharing, storytelling, and acts of caretaking and wellness are uplifted. Imagine and create a more equitable future in which we listen to and learn from the stories, struggles, and successes of those most impacted by a history of inequities, using them as roadmarkers towards the solutions we practice as a community. Initiatives The DEI Committee, in collaboration with members of the Dartmouth engineering community, will focus on the following areas: Mentorship and Support for BIPOC Students Develop mentorship programs and support networks for students who are members of the Black and Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC) community. Inclusion in the Classroom Listen to what students are experiencing in courses now, understand what has worked at Thayer and at other schools, and help instructors adopt more best practices. Community Engagement Provide more opportunities for community members to come together by organizing events and programming that address traumas and divides while cultivating trust and deepening relationships. Climate and Culture Support evidence-based change to policies, norms, and interactions that lead to Thayer being a place where ALL students, staff, and faculty are able to thrive. Mental Health and Wellness Focus on ways to support all members of the Thayer community through wellness activities and initiatives, identifying resources, engaging in open and honest dialogue, and making long-term plans.
