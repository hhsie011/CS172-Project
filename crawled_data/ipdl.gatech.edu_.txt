The lab facilitates courses related to the application of sensor-based technologies for use in everyday products and systems. The IPDL is unique: it is operated by both faculty and students working together. This combination produces a welcoming space where innovative design thinkers can create and collaborate through projects, initiatives, and research. The IPDL caters to curious minds and gives many students and faculty a space to interact and discover. About the Lab Get Involved The Lab In Action Research The IPDL offers a collaborative space for interdisciplinary research incorporating design and interactive technologies. Projects The IPDL supports courses and research for students to investigate, explore, and experiment with interactive technologies. Services Lab mentors provide support with the lab's many resources and faculty offer years of experience in application and research. Open Hours The lab has regular open hours throughout the week, access to tools and materials, and various student lead initiatives. Featured Research Project Latent Sheep Dreaming: Machine for Extrapolated Visual Inception Jiewen Wang, Ollie Hsieh, Jack Gale, Sienna Sun, Sang-won Leigh This installation explores the tension between human and machine agents in generative processes, inspired by Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?. A participant in an empty room is instructed to draw sheep at a stylus console. The stylus input is transformed into a matrix of locally and globally affected outputs. The result is increasingly unrecognizable with system influence, connoting how artists relinquish creative ownership to machines. Outputs are projected onto a wall and physicalized by a pen plotter. A collaboration between IPDL and Machine Poetics group, this project was accepted to DIS 2020.
