Creighton’s Accelerated Bachelor’s to Master’s programs give you a chance to start on an advanced degree while you’re still an undergraduate—so you can not only get a competitive edge in the job market, but also save time and money while you’re at it. On average, you can shave a full year, and $10,000, off your education. We offer accelerated options in fields including business, education, communication studies, health and wellness, leadership and science—nearly 30 programs in all. Find a Program Path Speak with an Enrollment Specialist Get a Creighton Education For Less Creighton University has been named a “Best Value” school by U.S. News and World Report. Stretching that value further by completing an Accelerated Bachelor’s to Master’s Program enables you to: Save approximately $10,000, on average, while earning your master’s degree. By completing your degree earlier, you’ll pay less tuition and fees overall. Lower the cost by applying undergraduate scholarships toward graduate courses until your bachelor’s degree is complete. Position yourself for a higher starting salary by earning a master’s degree before entering the workforce. Complete two degrees in less time than it would take to complete them each separately. During your first four years at Creighton, you’ll pay tuition and fees the same way as any undergraduate student—even when you start taking graduate courses. If you have a scholarship as an undergraduate, you can use that aid until your first four years are over. After that, you’ll follow the fee structure for whichever graduate program you’re enrolled in. You’re encouraged to make an appointment with Financial Aid to take a look at what this means for you. Advanced degree. Advanced opportunities. Students who earn master’s degrees earn higher starting salaries. When you enroll in our Accelerated Bachelor’s to Master’s Program, you’ll get in the job market—and launch your career—that much sooner. You’ll earn 9-12 credit hours toward your master’s degree while you’re still an undergraduate. In many cases, that’s nearly halfway toward your full master’s. Image Image How It Works During your first four years at Creighton, you’ll pay undergraduate tuition and fees, even when you start taking graduate courses. If you’ve earned undergraduate scholarships, you can put them toward those classes, too. After four years, you’ll follow the fee structure for whatever graduate program you enroll in. How to Apply Meet the minimum 3.0 GPA requirement. The application and selection process are competitive and GPA is a qualifying factor. Let your undergraduate advisor know you’re interested in an Accelerated Bachelor’s to Master’s Program. They’ll help you determine which program is right for you and show you how to get started. Have a D or an F on your transcript? Your undergraduate advisor and graduate program academic coach will help you determine if you’re eligible. Transfer students: You must have taken at least 12 hours of on-campus classes before applying to an Accelerated Bachelor’s to Master’s Program. International students: Your advisor will be able to discuss eligibility with you, as you must be able to take classes on-campus, not online. No GMAT or GRE test is required.
