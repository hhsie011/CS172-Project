You’ll be in class a few hours a day. Outside of that? The time is yours. Time to study, time to eat, time to get creative, time to work out, time to hang out. At Creighton, one of the hardest questions you’ll face is: What do you want to do today? Because there’s so much in store, and so many chances to discover something new to love. Schedule a Visit Healthy Body, Healthy Mind Our two fitness centers—one at each end of campus—mean you’ll never be too far from a workout. (There goes that excuse.) Need a workout partner? We offer 1,500 group classes a year, in cardio, strength and mind/body training. Or try your hand at one of dozens of club teams and intramural sports. See the Kiewit Fitness Center See the Rasmussen Center Explore Sports and Fitness Buckle down and focus. If you study best in a quiet space, our three libraries give you the solitude you need. Or you can head to the Skutt Student Center, the “living room of campus,” if you like your studies a little more social. Look Up Our Libraries Explore the Student Center Image Image Art is “the voice for the human soul.” Whether you were born to be onstage, or in the audience, the 71,600-square-foot Lied Education Center for the Arts is a hub of campus creativity. Theatre, Music, and Art at Lied Build the community you’re part of. Service is an integral part of our Jesuit tradition. At Creighton, you’ll have the chance to build a better world. Pursue Social Justice or Connect Passions in Learning Communities Give Back through the Schlegel Center for Service and Justice Find an Outlet with CU Involved Great Food (And Great Service) Life’s too short for blah food. At Creighton, you’ll be able to choose from omelets or sushi, fresh sandwiches or vegetarian meals, and a raft of specials every time you eat on campus. Between our two dining halls and grab-and-go options around campus—including two Starbucks—you’ll make time for meals. If you keep to a vegan, dairy- or gluten-free diet, or are allergic to certain foods, you’ll find many options. You can even consult with our campus dietitian to discuss your personal nutritional needs and goals. We’re also committed to giving back. Every year, we hold a peanut butter and jelly sandwich drive, in which members of the campus community gather to make and distribute sandwiches around Omaha. And we also volunteer at the Siena Francis House, where we prepare and serve meals to people experiencing homelessness.
