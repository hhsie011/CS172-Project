Under Executive Order 11246, the Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action (EOAA), on behalf of Columbia University, each year prepares and implements Affirmative Action Programs (AAPs) for the Morningside campus, the Medical Center and the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. Columbia’s programs include the cornerstones of effective Affirmative Action Programs: (1) equal opportunity, nondiscrimination and affirmative action policies which the University has established, implemented, and disseminated; (2) diagnostic procedures which allow the University to determine employment patterns and compare them to the composition of the relevant labor pool; and (3) action-oriented programs designed to assure that women, minorities, veterans and those with disabilities are being employed at a rate to be expected given their availability in the relevant labor pool. Discrimination Statement and Policy Columbia University is committed to providing a learning, living, and working environment free from unlawful discrimination and harassment and to fostering a nurturing and vibrant community founded upon the fundamental dignity and worth of all of its members. Consistent with this commitment, and with all applicable laws, it is the policy of the University not to tolerate unlawful discrimination or harassment in any form and to provide those who feel that they are victims of discrimination with mechanisms for seeking redress. Also consistent with this commitment, Columbia University prohibits any form of discrimination against any person on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, gender, pregnancy, age, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, marital status, status as a victim of domestic violence, citizenship or immigration status, creed, genetic predisposition or carrier status, unemployment status, partnership status, military status, or any other applicable legally protected status in the administration of its educational policies, admissions policies, employment, scholarship and loan programs, and athletic and other University-administered programs and functions. Nothing in this policy shall abridge academic freedom or the University's educational mission. Prohibitions against discrimination and discriminatory harassment do not extend to actions, statements or written materials that are relevant and appropriately related to course subject matter or academic debate. This policy governs the conduct of all Columbia University students, faculty, staff and visitors that occurs on the University’s campuses or in connection with University-sponsored programs. This policy also governs conduct by Columbia University students, faculty, staff and visitors that creates, contributes to, or continues a hostile work, educational, or living environment for a member or members of the University community. https://eoaa.columbia.edu/ To report an incident visit http://eoaa.columbia.edu/report-incident. Inquiries or complaints regarding any form of discrimination or harassment may be directed to: Marjory D Fisher Title IX Coordinator Associate Vice President 202A Philosophy Hall (212) 854-1276 [email protected] Jeri Henry Vice Provost, Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action 103 Low Library (212) 854-5918 [email protected] Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (New York Office) (646) 428-3800 [email protected] Gender-Based Misconduct The Policy and Procedures are designed to reflect the University’s commitment to a safe and non-discriminatory educational environment, consistent with Title IX, the Violence Against Women Act (“VAWA”), and New York State Education Law 129-B. Here are several important points about gender-based misconduct that the Policy addresses: Sexual harassment, sexual assault, sexual exploitation, gender based harassment, stalking, domestic violence, and dating violence are all forms of gender-based misconduct. In some instances, these behaviors do not have to be sexual in nature to be considered gender-based misconduct. Gender-based misconduct can occur between strangers or acquaintances, or people who know each other well, including between people involved in an intimate or sexual relationship. Gender-based misconduct can be committed by anyone regardless of gender identity, and it can occur between people of the same or different sex or gender. Most fundamentally, the University does not tolerate any form of gender-based misconduct. Students who experience gender-based misconduct can seek help and bring complaints in the University process. Those found responsible will be sanctioned in accordance with this Policy. Students who experience gender-based misconduct can also pursue criminal and civil processes, in addition to or instead of the University’s process under this Policy. This Policy and accompanying Procedures are part of the University’s multifaceted approach toward eliminating gender-based misconduct from our community, which includes: (1) educational programs; (2) services and resources for those affected by gender-based misconduct; (3) accessible, prompt, and fair methods of investigation and resolution of reports of misconduct; and (4) protections designed to prevent recurrence.
