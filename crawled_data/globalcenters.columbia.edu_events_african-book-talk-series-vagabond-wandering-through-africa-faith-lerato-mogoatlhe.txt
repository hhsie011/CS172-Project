With this series, CGC Nairobi provides a platform where African writers can engage a global audience, discussing not just their work but exciting perspectives on how personal, political, and cultural experiences drive their storytelling. In this book, Lerato takes the reader through her travels within the African continent. It is a journey that leads to self-discovery understanding herself, her people and her home. It is the story of how a four-day trip to Accra inspires her to quit her life and fabulous job as an entertainment and lifestyle journalist to backpack across West Africa. She had no job or savings except a travel experience of four work trips. Still, she believed the trip was necessary. She always had wanderlust and is passionate about telling stories of Africa beyond doom and gloom - the Africa of Bucketlist destinations and world heritage, home to creative and innovative people. Three months in West Africa turned into five years of living and traveling around Africa. Highlights include living in Mali and Timbuktu; confronting MP David Bahati over his hate bill that wanted LGBTI Ugandans killed; being adopted by Southern Sudanese refugees in Kakuma, Kenya while at the camp to write about the vote for independence from North Sudan; getting arrested at the inaugural Pride Uganda in 2012; traveling the Swahili Coast from Northern Mozambique to Lamu, Kenya, and a perspective-shifting breakdown at a mass grave in Ntarama, Rwanda. She does not live on the road anymore; however, she still travels Africa extensively because whatever this continent is, it is home, and she wants to know it intimately. Join us on 17th February 2022 as we delve deeper into this discussion of Lerato Mogoatlhe’s book to learn about her unique experiences as a drifter through the African Continent. This session will be moderated by Wendy Njoroge, a book curator, entrepreneur, community builder, and reading advocate who has formal and informal experience in the book industry in Kenya. You can find her on Twitter and Instagram as @MadamAfrika.
