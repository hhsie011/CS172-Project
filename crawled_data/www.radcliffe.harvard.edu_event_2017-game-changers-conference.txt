The Radcliffe Institute conference “Game Changers: Sports, Gender, and Society” will explore the relationship between sports and gender in the United States and around the world. The conference begins on the evening of Thursday, April 6, with an arts performance and conversation about Toni Stone, whose unprecedented athletic career had an impact on the struggle for equality and social justice in Jim Crow America. The program features a staged reading of scenes from the play Toni Stone by playwright Lydia R. Diamond RI ’13, based on the book Curveball: The Remarkable Story of Toni Stone, the First Woman to Play Professional Baseball in the Negro League by historian Martha Ackmann RI ’09. The program on Friday, April 7, consists of panel discussions with athletes, business leaders, coaches, physicians, policy makers, and scholars on the topics of access and inclusion, health and medical research, and media and popular culture. The day will feature a conversation with Laila Ali, the four-time undefeated super-middleweight boxing world champion, fitness and wellness expert, and author. #gamechangers Event Videos Play video Toni Stone | Panel Discussion FEATURING Martha Ackmann, journalist and author, The Mercury 13: The True Story of Thirteen Women and the Dream of Space Flight and Curveball Lydia R.
