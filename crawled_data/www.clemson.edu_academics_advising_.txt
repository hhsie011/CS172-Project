Academic advising supports the University's mission of preparing the student for learning beyond the confines of the academy. Academic advisors represent and interpret University policies and procedures to the student and help the student navigate the academic and organizational paths of the institution. To ensure that students receive both personal and professional assistance in navigating through curricula and University requirements toward degree completion and graduation, each student is assigned to an academic advisor (either professional or faculty advisor). Advisors are available to assist students with issues related to degree planning, course selection, withdrawals, degree requirements, academic policies, academic difficulty, campus resources, internships/practicum opportunities, and career/graduate school planning. Students are responsible for adhering to academic policies, preparing for advising meetings and taking ownership for their educational experience. Students receive academic advising materials from their advisors during pre-registration advising meetings. Students uncertain of their assigned advisor are encouraged to seek assistance from the departmental office/advising center for their major.
