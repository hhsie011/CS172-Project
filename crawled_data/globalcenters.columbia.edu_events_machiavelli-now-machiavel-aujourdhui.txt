Share Add to Calendar: Google Yahoo June 2, 2020 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM Virtual Event Live Virtual Event on Tuesday, June 2nd, 2020 at 1 PM (New York time) To RSVP, please click here. In this live virtual conversation (in French) organized by the Columbia University Maison Française, French historian Patrick Boucheron joins Jeffrey Freedman to talk about his book, Un été avec Machiavel (The Art of Teaching People What to Fear), which makes a case for rereading Machiavelli and for reading Machiavelli anew today. Machiavelli has been an important reference for many later thinkers, not least Antonio Gramsci in the Prison Notebooks. In this conversation, Boucheron reflects on the intersection of history, political theory and contemporary politics, touching on Machiavelli’s analyses of power and politics, his exploration of the dynamics of political fear, and how the political analyses of an earlier period can illuminate the present. Patrick Boucheron is Professor of History at the Collège de France. The starting points for this conversation are his books Un été avec Machiavel and Conjurer la peur, both recently translated into English. His book on Machiavelli, translated as The Art of Teaching People What to Fear by Other Press, was lauded and widely reviewed in the English language press, including reviews in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, and The New Criterion, among others. Patrick Boucheron's Machiavelli - The Art of Teaching People What To Fear is available here. Jeffrey Freedman is Professor of European History at Yeshiva University. He is currently working on the place of fear in the history of emotions. The live webinar will be in French. A subtitled recording will be available on the Maison française website subsequently. This event is organized by the Columbia Maison Française, and is co-presented by the Alliance Program, Columbia Global Centers | Paris, the Institute for Ideas and Imagination, and Other Press. Dans son livre, Un été avec Machiavel, l'historien Patrick Boucheron plaide en faveur de la relecture de Machiavel et de la lecture de Machiavel aujourd'hui. Machiavel a été une référence importante pour de nombreux penseurs ultérieurs, notamment Antonio Gramsci dans les Cahiers de prison. Dans cette conversation avec Jeff Freedman, Boucheron réfléchit sur l'intersection de l'histoire, de la théorie politique et de la politique contemporaine, abordant les analyses du pouvoir et de la politique de Machiavel, son exploration de la dynamique de la peur politique et comment les analyses politiques d'une période antérieure peuvent éclairer le présent. Patrick Boucheron est professeur d'histoire au Collège de France. Les points de départ de cette conversation sont ses livres Un été avec Machiavel et Conjurer la peur, tous deux récemment traduits en anglais. Jeffrey Freedman est professeur d'histoire européenne à l'Université Yeshiva. Il travaille actuellement sur la place de la peur dans l'histoire des émotions. Le webinaire en direct sera en français. Un enregistrement sous-titré sera disponible sur le site de la Maison française dans le courant de l'été.
