Architectural design studios that focus on the integration of thinking and making through design are central to the curriculum. Students take courses in the architecture foundation program for the first two years of study then focus on architectural design in the third and fourth year. Sequential studio courses provide the means for integration and synthesis of academic and professional knowledge that is learned in courses in building technology, architectural history and theory, and representation. Dedicated studio, woodshop, digital fabrication, and digital lab spaces allow for in-house drawing, modeling, and digital visualization. Graduates are qualified for a variety of positions in architecture and related fields for which a professional degree and registration are not requirements for advancement. Graduates are prepared to apply for a professional degree in architecture at the graduate level or a related discipline. Sasha W.
