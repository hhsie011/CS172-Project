ProCES courses integrate service into the curriculum through community-based research, historical and theoretical reflection on service, or course content that helps students explore and formulate responses to pressing societal issues. Students may also participate in community-engaged learning in a more in-depth matter as part of junior or senior independent work. The courses below and many others have a community-based or service-oriented component. 2022-2023 Fall Subject & Catalog Number Title AMS 322 Native American Literature AMS 406 Advanced Seminar in American Studies ANT 219 Catastrophes across Cultures: The Anthropology of Disaster ANT 368 Ethnography of Schools and Schooling ASL 105 Intermediate American Sign Language CBE 411 Antibiotics: From Cradle to Grave CEE 102A Engineering in the Modern World CEE 344 Water, Engineering, and Civilization COS 333 Advanced Programming Techniques DAN 306 Introduction to Radical Access: Disability Justice in the Arts EGR 200 Creativity, Innovation, and Design EGR 250 Community Project Studios: Non-credit EGR 251 Community Project Studios EGR 350 Community Project Studios: Non-credit EGR 351 Community Project Studios EGR 450 Community Project Studios: Non-credit EGR 451 Community Project Studios ENG 342 Indigenous Literature and Culture FRS 143 Is Politics a Performance?
