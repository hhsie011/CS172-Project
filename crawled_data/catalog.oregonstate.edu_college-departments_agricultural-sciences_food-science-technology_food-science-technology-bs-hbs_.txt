The program integrates principles and concepts in the physical, biological and engineering sciences (including courses in general chemistry, organic chemistry, biology, physics, math and statistics, biochemistry, microbiology, and food engineering) and applies them to the scientific and technical aspects of food and beverage processing. Students who achieve at least a 2.00 GPA in the required foundation courses in chemistry additionally earn a Chemistry minor. In addition to completing the Food Science and Technology Core, students must select from among three options (areas of concentration): Enology and Viticulture Fermentation Science Food Science All curricula are approved by the Higher Education Committee of the Institute of Food Technologists, making students eligible for national and Oregon IFT scholarships, as well as providing universal degree recognition within the food industry. Beyond choosing an option, students are able to further customize their studies through a menu of elective credits, facilitating the development of additional expertise in food related areas such as microbiology, toxicology, nutrition, horticulture, and animal sciences, and crediting formalized career and professional development experiences. Among minors that complement the Food Science and Technology major are Business, Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Microbiology, and Nutrition. Major Code: 135 Identify and explain essential foundational principles in Food Science: Food Chemistry and Analysis, Food Safety and Microbiology, Food Processing and Engineering, Sensory Science. Demonstrate the ability to integrate and apply scientific principles to describe complex food systems and solve problems in Food Science. Effectively express themselves orally, graphically, and in writing. Engage in activities that enhance their professional development. Grade Requirements All courses required for completion of the Food Science and Technology major must be passed, graded on the A–F scale. Included are both "core" and "option" courses in FST, as well as supporting courses in math, sciences, and written and oral communication. A C– grade, or better, must be earned in the specified prerequisites for the following courses. (These courses have additional prerequisites, but the C– minimum applies to the prerequisites listed below).

The major GPA is a cumulative GPA calculated on a list of courses particular to each option. Selected core and option courses are included, as specified in the list accompanying requirements of each option. Earning the Degree To earn a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Food Science and Technology, students must fulfill all of the FST major core requirements, and those of any one of three options: Enology and Viticulture, Fermentation Science, or Food Science. The Baccalaureate Core (general studies) component of an OSU bachelor's degree is considered fulfilled by the student's first degree. Additionally, the university requires that a minimum of 45 credits applied to this degree (32 if the first degree is from OSU) must be completed with Oregon State University course work completed while enrolled in this degree program. Additional information for prospective postbaccalaureate students is available at the FST undergraduate department website.
