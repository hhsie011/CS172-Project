If that ever happens to you, just look for the Red Lion at participating neighborhood merchants. The Red Lion is the logo for the CU Public Safety Safe Haven program organized by the Columbia University Department of Public Safety, which has screened more than 130 businesses near the Morningside, Manhattanville, and Medical Center Campuses. At businesses featuring the Red Lion in their windows, you can ask the merchant to phone Columbia University's Department of Public Safety or the police and wait for security personnel to respond.
