Close Search / Admissions / ResilienTU: Fall ’21 ResilienTU: Fall ’21 March 15, 2021 Thanks to the continued vigilance and healthy habits of our students, faculty and staff, many TU classes and labs are being held in-person instruction this spring. The University of Tulsa’s COVID-19 positivity rate has been below 1% every week this semester, and we are planning in-person events for current and prospective students. (Check out TU Outdoors!) With a solid foundation of safety protocols and a clear mission of putting the health of students first, TU has kept its campus open. Now, vaccines are rolling out and we have begun planning for the 2021-22 academic year. While we are closely monitoring the latest developments in the pandemic, we are optimistic about returning to an improved version of business as usual. We hope to reintroduce all of the opportunities that were removed this year due to COVID-19 but keep the flexibility, creativity and technological improvements that the pandemic inspired. We remain committed to keeping our community safe and adhering to local and federal guidelines. We want to balance that concern with providing all of the personalized academic opportunities and rich campus life expected from TU. With rising immunity and declining COVID-19 cases, TU can restore most classes and activities that had to be moved online. We want our students back on campus, with friends and faculty, at athletic events and music performances, in student organization and club meetings and hanging out in the Student Union. We want students to find new roommates, dance at the homecoming bonfire and hug each other after finals. We also want to embrace those pieces of flexible, virtual learning that many students enjoyed and appreciated. There are circumstances beyond a pandemic that might make it difficult for students to be on campus or in class, so we anticipate offering several remote courses during 2021-22 to accommodate those needs. We are excited to think about what a resilient, adaptable University of Tulsa will look like in the future, and we can’t wait to welcome everyone to campus this fall! Prospective students and their families are invited to visit our vibrant campus, talk with an admission counselor, a professor or a student success coach and find out more about TU’s plans for fall 2021.
