My research focuses on bivalve molluscs, with particoular focus on blue mussels and the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, and links between variations in shell biomineralisation, biomechanics, environmental conditions, and water chemistry. I use a combination of field, material characterization and modelling methods to study natural patterns in marine species, populations and communities, across large spatial scales and over historical times, and the biological implications at different organisational levels and geographic regions of projected changes under future climates.
