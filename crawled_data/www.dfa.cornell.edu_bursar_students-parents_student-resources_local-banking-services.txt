While a local checking or savings account is not required, having one does offer the advantage of writing checks to off-campus businesses who might not accept out-of-town checks. Most local banks do offer special student banking services aimed at their specific needs. Additionally, there are a few banks in the community who offer branches in locations outside of Ithaca and/or internationally, so you can take your account with you when you leave Cornell. The Bursar's office also offers direct deposit of student refund checks to provide students with quick access to their student refunds via electronic deposit to their own checking or savings account. Banking Locations On or Near Campus There are local banks who have full-service branches on campus as well as conveniently located ATM's. For branches located off-campus, the closest branch information has been displayed. For more information and other locations, contact the bank of your choice.
