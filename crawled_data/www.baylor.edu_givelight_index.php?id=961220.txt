Funded by Paul (BBA '79) and Alejandra Foster, of El Paso, Texas, the Foster Challenge was initially launched in May of 2019 as part of a $100 million gift in support of the Give Light Campaign. In September 2021, Baylor announced the successful completion of the Foster Academic Challenge, which generated significant support from alumni and donors to advance the aspirations of Illuminate, the University’s strategic plan. Prior to the Give Light Campaign, Baylor University had received funding for two endowed research chairs, which are enhanced chairs that provide additional funds for faculty research compared to traditional endowed chairs. The University’s total of research chair endowments grew to six with the launch of Give Light. The establishment of the Foster Academic Challenge then sparked transformational growth, nearly doubling the University’s total research chair count in two years through the creation of 14 additional research chairs. The University now holds 22 research chair endowments to advance R1-level research and enhance the University’s efforts toward top-tier designation.
