Fellowships are available for full-time Baylor faculty members (including tenured and tenure-track faculty, regular lecturers and senior lecturers) and graduate teaching assistants (teachers of record). Fellowship recipients will receive a stipend of $1,250 (pre-tax). Past recipients of teaching fellowships who wish to explore additional possibilities are eligible to reapply. Preference, however, may be given to first-time applicants. New in 2022, applicants may submit a proposal for incorporating special collections into an online course. For details on fellowship requirements and application procedures, click on the library or collection of interest below. All applications are due by Monday, April 11, 2022. Recipients will be notified by Friday, April 29, 2022.
