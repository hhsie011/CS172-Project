As a reminder, the PTS Benefit pays between 10% and 35% of your dependent child’s K-8 tuition at a NYC Private School as long as you and your child live within the five boroughs of New York City, and based upon qualifying family income. A child with two parents eligible for the benefit hired on or before July 1, 2011, and without a break in service of more than 31 days after 07/01/2011, can receive two scholarships simultaneously, up to a maximum of 70% of tuition. If you are applying for PTS coverage above 10%, you must submit 2021 tax returns for the child’s family, which will be used to determine the qualifying family income. If you do not wish to submit tax information, your PTS benefit award will equal 10% of the school’s tuition. EBPA will notify you by email if your PTS application is missing any required information. Please respond as quickly as possible to avoid any processing delays. If you have questions about the PTS Policy or other Tuition Program benefits, please call the Columbia Benefits Service Center at 212-851-7000 (9:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m., Monday-Friday) or email [email protected].
