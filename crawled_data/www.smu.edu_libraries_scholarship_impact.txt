SMU Libraries offers consultation and instruction on citation analysis, scholarly metrics, open access, researcher profiles and identification, and more. Researcher Identification Creating a unique and persistent identifier ensures your research outputs are correctly attributed to you and improves discoverability. There are a few different tools to do this, including ORCID and ResearcherID. Register for an ORCID iD Sign in to my ORCID PermaCC PermaCC is a service that creates permanent links to web content and ensures that material cited by authors will always be accessible to readers. Contact Sylvia Jones with questions or to sign up. Working Papers Publishing your working papers in repository provides increased exposure and persistence for your work. Learn more and submit your work to SMU Scholar, our institutional repository. For Cox faculty, learn more about submitting your work first to SSRN, which will also add it to SMU Scholar. Open Access Publishing Open access is a publishing model in which scholarship is made available online for free, increasing its visibility and reuse. SMU Libraries has agreements with Cambridge University Press, the Company of Biologists, and IEEE to cover the Article Processing Charges (APCs) for SMU-affiliated authors’ articles to be made available open access. We are not able to pay APCs for journals outside these agreements, although your school or college may have funds available for this purpose. Find journal titles included in this service. You may also be able to make pre- or post-prints available open access through SMU Scholar, our institutional repository.
