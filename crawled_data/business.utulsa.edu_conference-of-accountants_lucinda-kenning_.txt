Lucinda assumed this leadership role at a time of extensive change in the organization of the state’s executive branch agencies as legislation that merged and consolidated administrative functions took effect. Lucinda graduated with High Honors in both her undergraduate (1999) and graduate (2005) Business Administration programs at Oklahoma City University. She has been praised for her ability to apply academic principles to real-word environments with solutions that are both evidence-based and implementable. Ms. Kenning’s experiences in facilitating and leading the structural reorganization and cultural shift have made her passionate about sharing her experiences and best practices that she learned from the vantage point of a human resources practitioner. 800 S.
