2:00 PM The Shunde Building, Fourth Floor, Room 418, Tsinghua School of Economics and Management You are invited to join this high-level roundtable conference on the Role of the State in Economic Growth to be held on March 18th, 2016. As part of Columbia University President's Global Innovation Fund, in collaboration with the Columbia Global Centers | East Asia (Beijing), the Columbia University Initiative for Policy Dialogue and Tsinghua University, the Center on Global Economic Governance (CGEG) is conducting this three-year project policy-oriented research into Strategies for Growth: The Changing Role of the State, in collaboration with the Columbia Global Centers | Europe (Paris), East Asia (Beijing), and Latin America (Rio de Janeiro). This address by Joseph E. Stiglitz and subsequent discussion between Stiglitz and Edmund S. Phelps represent the public portion of a high-level roundtable conference on “The Role of the State in Economic Growth in East Asia.” As the world faces the possibility of another widespread slowdown, conference participants will consider key questions including: How can the global economy be “reset” to avoid long-term stagnation? What actions can individual countries, and especially China, pursue? What can Asia do as a region? And how do we achieve more global cooperation? Selected media members are invited to the luncheon keynote address. Following the luncheon, attending media will have the opportunity to interview guests including: Joseph E. Stiglitz, University Professor at Columbia University; winner of the 2001 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences Edmund Phelps, McVickar Professor of Political Economy, Columbia University; winner of the 2006 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences A. Michael Spence, William R. Berkley Professor in Economics & Business, Leonard N. Stern School of Business, NYU and winner of the 2001 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences Jan Svejnar, James T. Shotwell Professor of Global Political Economy and Founding Director of the Center on Global Economic Governance, Columbia University Organized by Center on Global Economic Governance Co-organized by Columbia Global Centers | East Asia Columbia University Initiative for Policy Dialogue Tsinghua University We very much hope you can attend the conference and interviews the expert participants during the media sessions.
