His research is focused on multimedia information retrieval, computer vision, machine learning, and signal processing. A primary goal of his work is to develop intelligent systems that can harness rich information from the vast amount of visual data such as those emerging on the Web, collected through pervasive sensing, or stored in gigantic content archives. A consistent theme of his research is turning unstructured multimedia data into searchable information. His work on content-based visual search in the early 90's, VisualSEEk and VideoQ, set the foundation of this vibrant area. Over the years, he continued to create innovative techniques for image/video recognition, multimodal analysis, visual information ontology, image authentication, and compact hashing for large-scale image databases. He has also applied the novel capabilities to multi-source news video search, mobile search, 3D object search, and brain machine interfaces. Impact of his work can be seen in more than 300 peer-reviewed publications (with more than 34,500 citations), numerous paper awards, 31 issued patents, and technologies licensed to six companies. For his long-term pioneering contributions, he has been awarded the IEEE Signal Processing Society Technical Achievement Award, ACM Multimedia Special Interest Group Technical Achievement Award, Honorary Doctorate from the University of Amsterdam, the IEEE Kiyo Tomiyasu Award, and IBM Faculty Award. For his dedicated contributions to education, he received the Great Teacher Award from the Society of Columbia Graduates. He served as Chair of Columbia Electrical Engineering Department (2007-2010), the Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Signal Processing Magazine (2006-8), and advisor for several international research institutions and companies. In his current capacity as Sr. Executive Vice Dean of Columbia Engineering School, he plays a key role in the School's strategic planning, special research initiatives, international collaboration, and faculty development. He actively participates in planning and steering of university initiatives such as Data Science, Nano Science, Precision Medicine, and Mind Brain and Behavior. He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and IEEE.
