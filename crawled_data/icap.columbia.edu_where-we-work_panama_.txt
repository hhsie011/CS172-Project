High rates of infection among vulnerable populations such as men who have sex with men and transgender women have significantly complicated the HIV epidemic in Panama in recent years, and the large influx of migrants fleeing the crisis in Venezuela has exacerbated the situation. ICAP is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Ministry of Health, President’s Emergency Fund for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) implementers, and civil society groups. These partnerships aim to improve current practices and to fast-track local capacity to meet national, PEPFAR, and UNAIDS goals by implementing innovative, effective, and comprehensive capacity-building strategies that strengthen service delivery and human resources for health.
