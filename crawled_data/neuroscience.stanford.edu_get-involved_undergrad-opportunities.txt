Stanford faculty seeking research assistants are invited to submit opportunities for undergraduates. For help, please contact Jill Wentzell. Chang Lab: academic year and summer opportunities We seek to understand the role in disease played by a class of genes called long noncoding RNAs Maduke Lab: academic year and summer opportunities We want to understand the molecular details of electrical signaling in the brain. de Lecea Lab: academic year and summer opportunities We study the neural circuitry and mechanisms underlying sleep and arousal. Luo Lab: academic year and summer opportunities We study how neuronal circuits are built during development and how their architecture enables specific functions in adults. Wheeler Lab: academic year and summer opportunities We seek to uncover the genetics and mechanisms of rare and undiagnosed diseases. Yang Sun Lab: academic year and summer opportunities Our lab researches new treatments for blinding diseases (glaucoma, retinal degeneration) Cheng Lab: academic year and summer opportunities Our lab is interested in understanding the mechanisms underlying the development and regeneration of these sensory hair cells. Sudhof Lab: academic year and summer opportunities We study how neurons communicate with each other at synapses. Green Lab: academic year and summer opportunities We aim to understand behaviourally diagnosed neurodevelopmental disorders by taking a "genetics first" approach Rasgon Lab: academic year and summer opportunities We aim to forge new, scientifically-based strategies to address the full spectrum of women’s mental health issues, Pages 1 2 3 4 next › last » Contact Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute Stanford Neurosciences Building 290 Jane Stanford Way, Rm E152 Stanford, CA 94305 (650) 723-3573 neuroscience@stanford.edu Campus Map Connect Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Join the Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute Mailing List Giving to the Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute Make a Gift Learn more about giving opportunities for the neurosciences at Stanford Stanford Home Maps & Directions Search Stanford Emergency Info Terms of Use Privacy Copyright Trademarks Non-Discrimination Accessibility © Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305.
