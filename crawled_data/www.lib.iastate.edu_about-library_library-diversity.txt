Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Iowa State University defines diversity broadly to include ability, age, gender, culture, race, religion, sexual orientation, and socio-economic background. Equity refers to fairness and social justice, such as treating people fairly while recognizing different people's needs may differ significantly. Inclusion means not only welcoming and including, but creating and ensuring conditions for full and meaningful participation so that all people feel they are welcome and valued as members of the wider University community. To create an environment that values and promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) requires action and engagement. The University Library actively supports and continues to enhance the advancement and celebration of DEI in the library system through our diverse collections, inclusive programming, responsive services offered, and other means. The University Library is an active participant in and supporter of campus, regional, and national DEI programs and organizations. See also the following DEI statements, links, and standards from our national professional organizations: American Library Association adopts new Code of Ethics principle on Racial and Social Justice (7.28.21) American Institute for Conservation: Equity & Inclusion Statement American Library Association: DEI Statement & Resources Association of College & Research Libraries: Diversity Standards: Cultural Competency for Academic Libraries Association of Research Libraries: Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Statement Society of American Archivists: Statement on Diversity & Inclusion University Library Statement on Diversity, Equity & Inclusion The University and the Library value the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). No one person or single committee can be responsible for creating and maintaining a welcoming and inclusive workplace environment where all people can feel they belong. This responsibility belongs to all of us as members of the Library. Conversations on DEI issues can be difficult. However, by engaging in open and collegial discussions on these topics, we strengthen our organization. We begin to learn and appreciate different facets that comprise our identities, both our own and those of our colleagues, and begin to understand one another more deeply. This knowledge and respect enriches our work. As the Library moves forward, let us all commit to "lean into our discomfort," to approach each other and our work with good intentions, honesty, and empathy, and trust our colleagues are doing the same. We are all aligned in the shared goal of creating an excellent Library. All of us throughout the Library, at all staff levels and responsibilities, are also vital participants in creating an inclusive and equitable Library, for ourselves, our colleagues, and our communities. (Adopted May 2018) University Library Position Description Diversity Statement The following statement has been approved for inclusion in all new and revised University Library position descriptions and job postings: ISU Library is a member of the ACRL Diversity Alliance and is committed to creating and sustaining a safe, healthy, and inclusive environment where all individuals can succeed and thrive. All library staff report their DEI efforts on annual evaluations and have strong commitment to public service and the land-grant mission. ISU students, staff, and faculty strive to overcome historical and divisive biases in our society. Library staff must embrace an environment of inclusion that moves beyond simple tolerance to recognizing the richness in individual identities of people, and diverse perspectives.
