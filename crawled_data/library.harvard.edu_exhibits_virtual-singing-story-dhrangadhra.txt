Through Friday, Jun 30, 2023 Open to the public Location Virtual Loeb Music Library 3 Oxford Street Cambridge, MA 02138 See All Hours View the Exhibit For centuries, the women of Dhrangadhra, in Western India, played a special role in singing stories of genealogy, life, and death. Much (but not all) of this activity took place within the walls of the zenana, an all-women's palace where many of Dhrangadhra's most important oral traditions were upheld. This exhibit features the sounds of these women's voices and their location in the zenana as well as some other parts of the palace, providing a glimpse into the wider collection of Dhrangadhra music found in the Archive of World Music of Harvard's Loeb Music Library.
