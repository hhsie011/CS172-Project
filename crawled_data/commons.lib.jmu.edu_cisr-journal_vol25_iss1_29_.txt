These munitions are traditionally challenging for clearance operations due to their wide area of impact upon deployment, small size, and random minefield orientation. Our past work focused on developing a reliable UAS capable of detecting and identifying individual elements of PFM-1 minefields to rapidly assess wide areas for landmine contamination, minefield orientation, and possible minefield overlap. In our most recent proof-of-concept study we designed and deployed a machine learning workflow involving a region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) to automate the detection and classification process, achieving a 71.5% rate of successful detection.2 In subsequent trials, we expanded our dataset and improved the accuracy of the CNN to detect PFM-1 anti-personnel mines from visual (RGB) UAS-based imagery to 91.8%. In this paper, we intend to familiarize the demining community with the strengths and limitations of UAS and machine learning and suggest a fit of this technology as a key auxiliary first look area reduction technique in humanitarian demining operations. As part of this effort, we seek to provide detailed guidance on how to implement this technique for non-technical survey (NTS) support and area reduction of confirmed and suspected hazardous areas with minimal resources and funding.
