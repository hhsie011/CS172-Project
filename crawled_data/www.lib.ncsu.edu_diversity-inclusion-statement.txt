Academic libraries aspire to an ideal of democratic access. We believe it is imperative that library work includes a sustained commitment to creating an inclusive atmosphere for diverse patron populations and an increasingly diverse profession. We acknowledge that our collections and spaces have reflected a broader system of inequality, and we commit ourselves to continued learning and improvement, recognizing that the work needed to become more accessible, equitable, diverse, and inclusive must be ongoing. Our goal is to provide safe and welcoming spaces where members of our community can be their full, authentic selves. We intentionally develop services, offer programs, and foster dialogues to promote understanding and an atmosphere where everyone is valued and respected. The Libraries recognize that nurturing these values is vital to both enhancing the mission of the university and to creating successful and innovative services, spaces, and collections. We endeavor to develop resources that reflect the academic interests and support the wellness of our diverse community.
