Juliet Hooker and Emily Owens Fulvio Domini and Massimo Riva Spring 2021 Happiness in Psychology and Philosophy Humanities and Life Sciences | 2018 Collaborative Humanities Course Award CLPS 0710 (Cognitive, Linguistic & Psychological Sciences), PHIL 0650 (Philosophy), HMAN 0700B (Cogut Institute) Joachim Krueger, Professor of Cognitive, Linguistic and Psychological Sciences Bernard Reginster, Professor of Philosophy This course promotes an encounter between distinct approaches to happiness in two disciplines. In philosophy, the question of happiness is essentially a normative question about how one should live. In psychology, it is an experiential question linked to a descriptive science. The course brings philosophical frameworks to bear on psychology and psychological findings to bear on philosophical assumptions. Students begin by writing short essays conforming to the demands of each discipline before collaborating on an interdisciplinary project. Fall 2020 Loss, Political Activism and Public Feelings: Between Fact and Affect Humanities and Social Sciences | 2019 Collaborative Humanities Course Award Juliet Hooker, Professor of Political Science Emily Owens, Assistant Professor of History Why do political actors deploy quantitative approaches when dealing with catastrophe, while personal experiences of grief draw heavily on affective resources? Juxtaposing texts from public health, public policy, empirical political science, and law, alongside cultural and artistic responses that focus on public feelings of mourning, rage, and defiance, this co-taught course examines political action between fact and affect. Case studies will include the long afterlife of transatlantic slavery, anti-lynching campaigns, the enshrining of the Civil War and Civil Rights Movement in national memory, and political movements such as ACT UP and the Movement for Black Lives. Spring 2020 Simulating Reality: The (Curious) History and Science of Immersive Experiences Humanities and Life Sciences | 2018 Collaborative Humanities Course Award CLPS 0540 (Cognitive, Linguistic & Psychological Sciences), ITAL 0701 (Italian Studies), HMAN 0700A (Cogut Institute) Fulvio Domini, Professor of Cognitive, Linguistic and Psychological Sciences Massimo Riva, Professor of Italian Studies, Director of the Virtual Humanities Lab, and Affiliated Professor of Modern Culture and Media Can an experimental approach enhance our critical and historical understanding of immersive experiences? The seminar explores the long history of 3D vision, from such pre-digital optical devices as the camerae obscurae, magic lanterns, panoramas, and stereoscopes, to contemporary VR, AR, or XR experiences designed for education and entertainment. Through a series of collaborative activities and experiments, the seminar explores themes of virtual travel, social surveillance, and utopian imagination—and the intersecting desires to intensify the experience of reality and to escape reality altogether. https://www.youtube.com/embed/fltuz2hlmLk Spring 2020 Student Projects With the COVID-19 pandemic, student presentations for "Simulating Reality" morphed into what could be defined as a simulation of a real seminar.
