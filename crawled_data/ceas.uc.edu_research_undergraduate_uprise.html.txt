Entrepreneurial Co-op Program Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Hardware and Embedded Systems Security and Trust (RHEST) Projects UC UPRISE: University of Cincinnati Undergraduates Pursuing Research in Science and Engineering The UC UPRISE Program provides research opportunities to talented UC undergraduates from under-represented groups pursuing degrees and careers in STEM fields. By providing research mentorship, opportunities for students to engage with faculty and peers in the sciences, and professionalization workshops the program will promote the success of students in the science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medical professions. Faculty Application Student Application About UPRISE The UPRISE program consists of a 12-week summer research opportunity, during which students develop their research and analytical skills investigating a specific scientific question that is supervised by a faculty mentor. Students will also meet together weekly for professionalization workshops on topics designed to help them succeed in STEM fields. These workshop topics include discussions on how to apply to graduate and medical school, how to present research at a conference, and effective science communication. At the conclusion of the program, students present their research to the university community. UPRISE students receive a $4,500 stipend, distributed over six biweekly payments. Students are also encouraged to present their research at national and international conferences, and UPRISE is able to contribute funds to help students do this. The University of Cincinnati does not discriminate on the basis of disability, race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, parental status (including status as a foster parent), sex, age, sexual orientation, veteran status, military status (past, present, or future), or gender identity and expression in its programs and activities.
