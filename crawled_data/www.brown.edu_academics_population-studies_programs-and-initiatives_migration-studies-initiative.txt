As a global phenomenon with far-reaching social, political, and economic consequences, migration is a critical area for interdisciplinary study and public-facing research. MSI serves as a central hub at Brown for students, faculty, and staff interested in migration, mobility, and displacement in both theoretical and applied contexts. The initiative supports high-quality faculty and student research in the interdisciplinary field of migration studies, assists in the training of graduate and undergraduate student researchers, and develops engaging programming for the campus on migration-related issues. As scholars and members of Rhode Island’s urban core, community-engaged research and praxis are central tenets to the work that we do. Thus, the Initiative also aims to partner with members of local community-based organizations that support immigrant and refugee communities in Rhode Island for community-based and responsive research, campus events, and other opportunities.
