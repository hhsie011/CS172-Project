Lautenberg Professor of Ethics and Corporate Governance, has worked to transform the role that Columbia Business School students play in business and society. In 1981, Ray founded the Public and Nonprofit Management Program, which was later renamed the Social Enterprise Program and widened to include social entrepreneurship, corporate social responsibility, and international development. While Ray’s early research focused on public management and municipal labor relations in New York City, he has in recent years taught the courses Board and Executive Management of Nonprofits and Conceptual Foundations of Business, and he continues to teach his popular course, Modern Political Economy. Ray was named Faculty Director of Social Enterprise Programs in the School’s Executive Education division in 2009, and since then has directed custom programs including those for the Center for Curatorial Leadership, the King Khalid Foundation, and most recently the West Harlem Nonprofits program. Ray has stayed active in the School's administration, having recently chaired a faculty committee that re-wrote the School's newly adopted governance rules. As Ray passes the mantle to program co-directors Ray Fisman, the Lambert Family Professor of Social Enterprise, and Bruce Usher, an Executive-in-Residence and the Lise Strickler '86 and Mark Gallogly '86 Faculty Director, we would like to pay tribute to Ray Horton and celebrate his legacy through the establishment of a Social Enterprise Program fund in his honor. We ask anyone who has known Ray—whether as a student, alumnus, or friend of the program—and who believes in the cause to which he has dedicated his professional life, to please consider contributing to the Ray Horton Social Enterprise Fund, which will be used to support the wonderful program that Ray created.
