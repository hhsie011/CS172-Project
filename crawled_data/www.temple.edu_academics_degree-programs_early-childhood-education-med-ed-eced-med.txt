This master’s degree program provides you with the theoretical knowledge and instructional techniques to adapt classroom instruction to the developmental changes of childhood and early adolescence. Beyond the foundational courses, you will develop—or sharpen—instructional strategies for teaching literacy, math, science and social studies in a manner that complements the cognitive and emotional capacities of young children. You will also learn how to effectively teach children who are English language learners, have disabilities or face other educational challenges. Your master’s program culminates in a semester-long student teaching assignment, during which you’ll hone your classroom instruction and management skills. A capstone course gives you the opportunity to reflect on your student teaching experience and the degree program in general. Teacher Certification This program prepares you to successfully complete state certification exams, allowing you to apply for a Pennsylvania Instructional I Teaching Certificate. Learn more about certification. Fieldwork In addition to state certification exams and student teaching, you must complete field experiences as part of your coursework. Field placements are designed to give you teaching experience working with children in educational and non-educational settings. The majority of field experiences require students to spend seven full days over the course of a semester in the classroom. During the student teaching semester, students are required to spend every day in the classroom for 14 weeks. Classes & Curriculum The degree program consists of 37 credits, including two foundational courses: Child and Adolescent Development and Problems in Educational Psychology, a seminar series. You will also complete 15 credits on early childhood instruction and nine credits in special education and English language learner instruction. Your final seven credits constitute the culminating work for this degree. Most courses are held on Temple’s Main Campus in Philadelphia, though some online and hybrid options are available. Courses are held in the evening starting at 5:30 p.m. You can attend full- or part-time, and you have up to four years to complete the program.
