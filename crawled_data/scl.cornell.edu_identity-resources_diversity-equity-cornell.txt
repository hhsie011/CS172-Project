In Student & Campus Life, our goal is that every student -- of every background and identity -- experiences Cornell as a welcoming, inclusive campus community where they can grow, thrive, and succeed in all aspects of their lives. The Diversity & Inclusion portfolio within the Dean of Students Office is comprised of identity-based centers and offices that support and empower students from historically marginalized backgrounds while also providing all Cornell community members with opportunities to deepen their understanding of racial justice and equity, expand their allyship skills, engage in dialogue across difference, and be a part of the movement for positive social change.
