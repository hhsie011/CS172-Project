The Office of the University Ombuds is not a confidential resource for matters mandated by federal or state law to be reported, such as sexual assault or harassment. Any disclosures made to Ombuds personnel with regard to these matters must be reported to the appropriate University personnel. The Office of the University Ombuds may still maintain confidentiality with regard to other university related concerns. Our office staff will listen to your concerns and help you identify options for successful resolution. Services The Ombuds Office is open for scheduled appointments. Please call the office and set an appointment with a staff member at 513-556-5956. If no one is able to answer your, please be sure to leave a voicemail with your name and clear phone number in which to reach you. A staff member will return your call as soon as possible, typically within a few business hours. If you find yourself asking any of the following questions, the Ombuds office is here to help: Can they do that? Who do I talk to? I'm lost in the bureaucracy. Am I misreading the situation? What are my options? 607 Swift Hall PO Box 210180 Cincinnati, OH 45221-0180 513-556-5956 Phone 513-556-5959 Fax UC Tools Canopy & Canvas One Stop Email Catalyst Shuttle Tracker IT Help UC VPN Bearcats Landing About Us Maps & Directions Jobs News Diversity Governance & Policies Directory Events Calendar University of Cincinnati | 2600 Clifton Ave. | Cincinnati, OH 45221 | ph: 513-556-6000 Alerts | Clery and HEOA Notice | Notice of Non-Discrimination | eAccessibility Concern | Privacy Statement | Free Speech | Copyright Information © 2020 University of Cincinnati 607 Swift Hall PO Box 210180 Cincinnati, OH 45221-0180 513-556-5956 Phone 513-556-5959 Fax © 2020 University of Cincinnati scroll up to the top
