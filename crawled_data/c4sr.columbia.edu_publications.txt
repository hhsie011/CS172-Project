Data can be viewed across time, which reveal changes in patterns of movement as the geopolitics, price of oil, and conditions at specific ports change."}]},"field_lead_image":{"und":[{"fid":"591","uid":"39","filename":"SIDL_Port_to_Port01_0.jpg","uri":"public:\/\/SIDL_Port_to_Port01_0_1.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"169866","status":"1","timestamp":"1460134674","type":"undefined","metadata":[],"alt":"","title":"","width":"1200","height":"750"}]},"field_author_c4sr":{"und":[{"nid":"137"},{"nid":"14"},{"nid":"13"}]},"field_author_last_names_for_tabl":{"und":[{"value":"Project Lead: Juan Francisco Saldarriaga","format":null,"safe_value":"Project Lead: Juan Francisco Saldarriaga"}]},"field_publication_short_title_ca":{"und":[{"value":"Port to Port","format":null,"safe_value":"Port to Port"}]},"field_is_website_":{"und":[{"value":"1"}]},"field_pub_themes":{"und":[{"tid":"81"},{"tid":"84"},{"tid":"90"},{"tid":"119"},{"tid":"82"}]},"field_methods":{"und":[{"tid":"105"},{"tid":"101"},{"tid":"108"}]},"field_dashboard_sort_date":{"und":[{"value":"2014-07-08 00:00:00","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datetime"}]},"name":"dare","picture":"0","data":"a:5:{s:16:\u0022ckeditor_default\u0022;s:1:\u0022t\u0022;s:20:\u0022ckeditor_show_toggle\u0022;s:1:\u0022t\u0022;s:14:\u0022ckeditor_width\u0022;s:4:\u0022100%\u0022;s:13:\u0022ckeditor_lang\u0022;s:2:\u0022en\u0022;s:18:\u0022ckeditor_auto_lang\u0022;s:1:\u0022t\u0022;}","initiative":"Advanced Data Visualization","sort_date":"2014","author":"Juan Saldarriaga, Laura Kurgan, Dare Brawley, Jen Lowe","pub_name":"Spatial Information Design Lab","pub_link":"http:\/\/spatialinformationdesignlab.org\/project_sites\/port_to_port\/","pub_pdf":"","image_uri":"public:\/\/SIDL_Port_to_Port01_0_1.jpg","image_large":"https:\/\/c4sr.columbia.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/c4sr_large_inline_slideshow_980x500\/public\/SIDL_Port_to_Port01_0_1.jpg?itok=WuiiYwoQ","image_small":"https:\/\/c4sr.columbia.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/homepage-400x300\/public\/SIDL_Port_to_Port01_0_1.jpg?itok=zIfAAFbc"}},{"nid":"219","access":true,"node":{"vid":"219","uid":"39","title":"Jumping the Great Firewall","log":"","status":"1","comment":"1","promote":"0","sticky":"0","nid":"219","type":"publication","language":"und","created":"1460134248","changed":"1472849165","tnid":"0","translate":"0","revision_timestamp":"1472849165","revision_uid":"39","field_author":{"und":[{"value":"Dan Taeyoung","format":null,"safe_value":"Dan Taeyoung"}]},"field_publication_date":{"und":[{"value":"2014-04-08 00:00:00","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datetime"}]},"field_publication_name_page_numb":{"und":[{"value":"Spatial Information Design Lab","format":null,"safe_value":"Spatial Information Design Lab"}]},"field_keywords":[],"field_pdf":[],"field_publication_link":{"und":[{"url":"http:\/\/spatialinformationdesignlab.org\/jumping-the-great-firewall\/","title":null,"attributes":[]}]},"field_publication_description":{"und":[{"value":"This project visualizes a relatively new phenomenon: online free expression in China.
