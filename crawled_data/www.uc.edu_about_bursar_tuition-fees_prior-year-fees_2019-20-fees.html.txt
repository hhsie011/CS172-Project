Undergraduates enrolled part-time (1-11 credit hours) are charged on a per credit hour basis determined by the offering college and career of the class section. Full-time students taking classes outside of their primary career and/or campus, where costs are higher, will be subject to a “differential fee.” The amount of the fee is the difference between their primary career/campus flat rate instructional fee and the higher career/campus instructional fee. This fee will be assessed only when a student is enrolled in 7 or more credit hours at the campus/career with the higher costs. Students taking fewer than 7 hours will not be assessed this fee. The same applies to the non-resident surcharge (in some cases the non-resident surcharge is less so student will receive a waiver for the difference). For example, if a student enrolled full-time in a UC Blue Ash program, registered for 7 or more credit hours offered by Uptown campus they would be charged the flat rate instructional fee of UC Uptown opposed to the UC Blue Ash instructional fee. Undergraduate students taking classes without being enrolled in a UC degree program are classified as non-matriculated. Non-matriculated students are charged the tuition and fees of the current cohort. For example, a non-matriculated student enrolled in Fall semester 2022 will pay Cohort 2022-23 rates. If the student remains non-matriculated and then enrolls in Fall semester 2023 they would then pay the Cohort 2023-24 rates. *For Summer Semester 2020 (2205) ONLY, the Campus Life Fee and General Fee will not be charged at any campus.
