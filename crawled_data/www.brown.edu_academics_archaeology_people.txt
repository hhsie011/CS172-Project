The faculty housed in the Joukowsky Institute reflect its wide geographical scope and breadth of interests. Faculty members are cross-appointed to the Institute, and our partner departments at present include Classics, History of Art and Architecture, Anthropology, and Egyptology and Assyriology. The wider campus community of the Institute includes faculty in these and other related departments — notably Religious Studies, History, Engineering, Judaic Studies, and Geology — who are frequent participants in Institute events and activities. To further encourage this engagement with colleagues with archaeological interests, the Institute appoints between one and four Brown faculty members as Faculty Fellows each year. The Institute regularly hosts visiting students and faculty members, whose backgrounds, perspectives, experiences, and skills enhance our intellectual and professional breadth and connections, as well as our social and cultural vitality. Our Postdoctoral Fellowship program, in particular, has become known internationally for providing an intellectual home for some of archaeology's most thoughtful and innovative young scholars. Faculty research and publications range in focus from Greek and Roman art and architecture to landscape archaeology, from contemporary ethnography to Roman provincial studies (of both western and eastern provinces), and from the Aegean Bronze Age to the archaeology of the Caribbean. Faculty are currently leading field projects on Sardinia in Italy, on Crete in Greece, on Montserrat in the West Indies, and in France, Mexico, Sudan, Turkey, and Providence, Rhode Island. The undergraduate and graduate programs in Archaeology and the Ancient World are based in the Joukowsky Institute, as are many of Brown University's archaeology courses. An active program of scholarly and public lectures, conferences, and workshops is in place, offering frequent events for the Brown University community, as well as interested members of our broader, off-campus communities. The Institute has also formed an Advisory Board, comprised of faculty, students, and other professionally relevant community members, both from Brown and from other institutions.
