Skip to main content Online Directory Name, Phone, Email and More Student, Faculty, and Staff Directory This tool lists CSU students, faculty and staff. For other searches, see the sidebar. Results appear as you type To do a new search, just backspace and/or type something else in the box Alternate Access to this Search is Available type your search into this box: Enter Search String: Help Using a comma: Use a comma to look up "Lastname, Firstname." Using a space: Use a space to specify that you are looking for "Firstname Lastname." Nicknames: Use a nickname in place of first name. "Lastname, Nickname" and "Nickname Lastname" will both work, as long as the person has their nickname registered in eID. Preferred First Names: see 'Nicknames,' above. Don't Know the Spelling: Just type the first portion(s) of the name. For example, you can type "Ody" to find Odysseus. You can do this with the first, last, or both names. Last Name Only: A last name all by itself also works. Note: with less-common last names, this is helpful. More-common last names, though, may return too many results to be helpful. First Name Only: Because last-name-only searches are allowed, first-name-only ones are not. Middle Names: Ignore middle names. To search for "Charles Emerson Winchester," just type "Charles Winchester." Middle Initial: Omit the middle initial. Only use last name, and optionally first name/nickname. Hyphenated last names: Search only the first part of the compound last name. For "Olivia Newton-John," just type "Olivia Newton." Complex last names: Names with multiple spaces, such as "de la Hoya," will be returned normally. What about privacy?
