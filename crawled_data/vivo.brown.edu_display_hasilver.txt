Work is underway on the integration of algorithms with hardware and software, in particular, for microphone-array systems, speech recognition systems, and reconfigurable parallel processors. Research Statement Research focuses on algorithms for the building and use of real-time digital signal processing/speech processing based systems. Work is underway on the integration of algorithms with hardware and software, in particular, for microphone-array systems, speech recognition systems, and reconfigurable parallel processors. Most recent work has focused on micrfophone-array research. A microphone-array system that supports real-time processing and data acquisition for 512 microphones has been in operation for seven years. It is still in use for algorithm research and data acquisition. In past work, speech recognition was a major focus. Also, Professor Silverman's group introduced important new concets on the use of FPGA's in developing reconfigurable computing. The current emphasis on microphone-array systems has resulted in three patents and license agreements with three industrial organizations. Prior to joining the Brown faculty in 1980, Professor Silverman held a position at IBM at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center from 1970 to 1980, working in the areas of digital image processing, computer performance analysis, and speech recognition. Dr. Silverman has been the Director of the Laboratory for Engineering Man/Machine Systems in the Division of Engineering at Brown since its founding in 1981. He was a member of the IEEE Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing Technical Committee on Digital Signal Processing and was its Chairman from 1979 until 1983. He was the General Chairman of the 1977 ICASSP in Hartford. He received an IEEE Centennial Medal in 1984. Professor Silverman was a Trustee of Trinity College in Hartford, CT, 1994-2003, and was named a Fellow of IEEE in December 1996. He served as Dean of Engineering at Brown from 1991 until 1998. Professor Silverman's research group has averaged 5 Ph.D. students, and 23 Ph.D.'s have been awarded over 1988-2005.
