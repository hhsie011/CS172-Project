This profession encompasses multiple disciplines to ensure functionality of the built environment by integrating people, place, process and technology. Students take courses in the architecture foundation program for the first two years of study then focus on facilities management practice in the third and fourth year. The program features theoretical and applied learning and real world experience. The Facilities Management courses include industry connections and/or partnerships with professionals coming into the classroom and students visiting them on sites, thus building professional networks. The Facilities Management Lab is a dedicated workspace for Facilities Management students to utilize resources and engage in hands-on projects related to facility design and installation. Dedicated group work areas, studio, woodshop, digital fabrication, and digital lab spaces allow for in-house research drawing, modeling, and digital visualization. Graduates of the program are equipped to work in a range of facility management specializations including government, healthcare, higher education, corporate, and real estate. Graduates are prepared to apply for graduate studies in architecture, facilities management or a related discipline, and can pursue facility management certification after entering into the profession.
