M&VE serves as supplemental advising to academic advising provided by studentsâ€™ academic advisers and covers various topics such as academic support, career preparedness, physical and mental health, financial stability, goal-setting, community resources, social engagement, resiliency and mental toughness, and more. M&VE Advising uses CU Navigate to work with other advisers to collaboratively and comprehensively support Clemson student veterans. Veteran Employment Transition Workshops This four-part workshop series is designed to meet student veterans where they are and provide relevant and appropriate resources to help them increase their career awareness and readiness.
