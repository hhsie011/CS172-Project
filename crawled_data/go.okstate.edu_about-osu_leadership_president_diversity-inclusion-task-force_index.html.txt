Providing a wide range of ways to understand and engage with the world, identifying opportunities and creating solutions are core to our mission as a land-grant university. We fulfill our mission and enrich our campus community by maintaining a welcoming and inclusive environment that appreciates, values and fosters a sense of belonging for all. The definitions of these three key words are important as our campus embraces DEI. Diversity means a variety of different and unique identities, characteristics, experiences and perspectives. Equity is defined as making available to everyone what they need to succeed by increasing access, resources and opportunities for all — especially for those who are underrepresented and have been historically disadvantaged. Inclusion is what we do. Inclusion creates a welcoming culture where differences are celebrated and everyone is valued, respected and able to reach their full potential. We also humbly recognize there are events in the university’s 130-year history that at times have not upheld these values; however, we are continually working toward a future that instills pride for all in our community. Incidents of social injustice — both historical and recent — unfortunately exist within our society but are not welcome on the OSU campus. While the First Amendment allows considerable latitude with respect to free speech, we denounce acts, behavior, language or symbols representing or reflecting intolerance or discrimination towards any person affiliated with our University. OSU pledges to support and reinforce diversity, equity and inclusion efforts as they are significant to our campus culture and mission, and improve the quality of life for all.

The objective of the OSU Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Task Force is to develop and publish a new comprehensive university-wide DEI plan detailing timed, measurable goals and specific initiatives that will be implemented across campus in coming years. The ultimate goal is to help foster an environment where OSU students, faculty, staff all have equal opportunities to find success as was outlined by the OK State Stand United organization in their List of Urgencies published in the summer of 2020. Campus Climate Survey In spring and fall of 2020, a campus climate survey was sent to both OSU students and employees to help inform our efforts. We appreciate all of those in our campus community who participated to provide this valuable feedback. Learn about the survey results here. In addition, ideas, questions and additional feedback can be sent to deitaskforce@okstate.edu.
