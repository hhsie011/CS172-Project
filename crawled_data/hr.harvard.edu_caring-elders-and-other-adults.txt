Planning Resources Harvard offers multiple resources that can help faculty and staff plan for and support an elder or other adult. Harvard's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) provides advice and recommendations on any elder- or adult-care issue, and referrals to resources nationwide. The EAP can also connect faculty and staff to related supports such as financial, legal and mental-health resources. The Senior Care Solutions program, provided by Care.com, helps faculty and staff navigate the ever-changing demands of caring for an aging family member or other adult by connecting them with a professional senior care advisor, a licensed geriatric social worker who is an expert in adult and elder care. The program also provides referrals and access to vetted services around the country. You must pre-register and submit a waiver for this service. Please go here for details on the registration process and to learn more about all services available through Care.com. Backup Care If an adult relative’s needs or care arrangements suddenly change or your regular care is unavailable, you can find backup care to cope with a short-term need. Care.com Backup Care is a service that sends a screened and qualified care provider to your adult relative’s home. You must pre-register and submit a waiver for this service. Please go here for details on the registration process and to learn more about all services available through Care.com. Please note: Adult back-up care may require an assessment of care needs and therefore as much time as possible should be allowed. The SOURCE Program provides employees up to $350 per year to help pay for back-up care. Benefits-eligible employees with a full-time equivalent annual salary of less than $75,000 are eligible.
