Starr Program in Business, Entrepreneurship, and Organizations (BEO) is an undergraduate concentration designed to educate students to be creative and flexible leaders in a number of careers. BEO is sponsored by the departments of Economics and Sociology and the School of Engineering and engages faculty and students in the study of commercial activity, technical and social entrepreneurship, innovation, and the organizations within which such activity occurs. The BEO Concentration will be sunsetted and replaced with undergraduate concentration offered in the Departments of Economics (Business Economics) and Sociology (Organizational Studies). Brown undergraduate students admitted to the class of 2023 and earlier may pursue any of the three tracks in BEO: BEO Economics, BEO Organizational Studies or BEO Entrepreneurship & Technology Management or the new undergraduate concentration offerings in the Departments of Economics (Business Economics) and Sociology (Organizational Studies). Learn more about the Curricular Pathways to Study Business at Brown. New to Brown's undergraduate offerings is the Entrepreneurship Certificate offered through the Nelson Center for Entrepreneurship. The certificate program in entrepreneurship provides curricular structure for undergraduate students who wish to make entrepreneurship an important part of their intellectual journey at Brown. Students interested in Brown's graduate programs in the field of entrepreneurship and technology management should consider the Program in Innovation Management and Entrepreneurship (PRIME), offered through the School of Engineering. There is also an opportunity for more senior managers to pursue an executive MBA through the IE Brown Executive MBA Program.
