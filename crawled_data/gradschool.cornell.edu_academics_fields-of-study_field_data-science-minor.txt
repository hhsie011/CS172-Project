Many employers actively seek applicants with data science skills and minoring in data science will widen a student’s set of career paths substantially. Students take courses in four areas: computation, statistical modeling and inference, optimization, and ethical, legal, and policy issues. The DGS will maintain a list of courses in each of these areas. The courses that a student uses towards the minor must be in at least two of the four areas, and no more than two courses in any one of the areas can be used towards the minor. A Ph.D. student minors in the field of data science by adding a faculty member in the field as a minor member of the student’s committee. Learning Outcomes Demonstrated ability to extract meaningful information from complex data sets and quantify uncertainty about that information. Demonstrated ability to apply data science techniques, e.g., statistical analysis and computation, to the student’s major. Awareness of ethical, legal, and policy issues pertaining to Data Science.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
