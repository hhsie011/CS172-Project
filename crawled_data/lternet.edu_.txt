The LTER Data Sampler R package! Looking for environmental data to teach environmental or data science? This package contains 8 (soon more!) datasets curated and cleaned just for teaching! The Short Stories About Long-Term Research blog relaunch We just relaunched the SSALTER Blog , a graduate student blog about long-term research. Home Who We Are We are over 2000 researchers at 28 sites who apply long-term observation, experiments, and modeling to understand how ecological systems function over decades. Read All… Research LTER research integrates many disciplines to understand ecological processes as they play out at individual sites, while synthetic studies reveal broader principles that operate at a global scale. Read All… Education Long-term relationships with schools, community groups, resource managers, and landowners provide a foundation for innovative education and outreach programs. Undergraduate and graduate students benefit from working with a diverse and close-knit community of researchers.

It's so great to be in-person after two years #NSFfunded @USLTER @NEON_sci Looking forward to an awesome summer of ecology and environmental data science Reply on Twitter 1530213896698486784 Retweet on Twitter 15302138966984867844 Like on Twitter 153021389669848678437Twitter 1530213896698486784 US LTER@USLTER· 25 May A new one from @caplter showing the power of their Phoenix Area Social Survey! We heard all about it last week at the Science Council meeting-great to see it in action!

A @USLTER working group synthesized data from 39 global change experiments, looking at how plants that adapted to a 1st change (e.g. temperature, drought, nutrient supply) fared against a 2nd. The takeaway? Specializing in 1 resource was not as important as expected!
