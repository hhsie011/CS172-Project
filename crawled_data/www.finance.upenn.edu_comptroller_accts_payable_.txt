Elimination Of Paper PO Invoices Received Via Postal Mail The Accounts Payable Office of the University of Pennsylvania is in the process of moving to a paperless environment. Effective July 2022, we will no longer accept paper invoices sent through intramural or US postal mail. We encourage suppliers to send invoices via email – POINV@upenn.edu or submit their invoices using the PO Flip functionality in the Penn Marketplace. Benefits: No more waiting for AP to receive invoices in the mail. By emailing or flipping PO’s, the invoice will be sent directly to our working queues which will allow your invoices to be processed quicker. Environment Friendly – Reducing paper waste is good for the environment Supplier paper and postage savings Instructions for Emailing Invoices and PO Flips Email: Send PO invoices via email: POINV@upenn.edu Must send in PDF format: one file per invoice, number of files per email is unlimited PO number must be included on the invoice, not in the body of email or subject DO NOT send other attachment formats with the invoices such as excel spreadsheets. This will cause the email/invoice to be rejected. DO NOT send inquiries to this email box, this email address is not monitored. Supplier or payee inquiries should be sent to our Penn web form: https://www.finance.upenn.edu/supplier-payee-submission-form/ PO Flips: Note: You must be registered in the Penn Marketplace to use PO Flips. Suppliers who register can log in and use the PO Flip functionality to submit an invoice corresponding to the PO. PO Flips allow suppliers to select their specific PO, then turn that PO into an invoice. The invoice will reflect the same information as on the PO and may be adjusted by the supplier before it is submitted. This functionality eliminates the need for the supplier to create an invoice and email it to AP to be manually keyed in and paid. If you are not already registered with our Penn Marketplace please reach out to your Penn Buyer and ask to be invited. Please use this link for instructions for using the PO Flip option: https://cms.business-services.upenn.edu/purchasing/images/stories/pdfs/submitting_po_invoices_through_the_penn_supplier_portal.pdf Elimination Of AP Email Address & Phone Support Line The Accounts Payable Office of the University of Pennsylvania will be eliminating the APSUP email address (dofapsupp@pobox.upenn.edu) and the AP phone support line (215-898-2626) effective July 2022.
