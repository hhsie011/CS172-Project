WGGA is an interdisciplinary and international network whose primary purpose is to build connections among academics engaged in teaching, research and advocacy on issues pertaining to gender in global affairs. The Covid-19 pandemic, the institutional responses it is eliciting, and the social disruptions it is generating have highlighted the importance of renewing and extending connections among scholars and educators focused on women and gender in global affairs. Covid-19 may aggravate pre-existing threats to gender rights and critical gender discourses associated with rising authoritarianism and sovereigntism. Governments’ invocations of emergency powers are rarely accompanied by encouragement – or even tolerance – for critical discourses, rights-oriented policies, and intellectual and political liberties, such as those associated with the development of gender-focused programs in academia and beyond. At the same time, Covid-19 can also help foster critical thought and collective mobilizations that prepare the terrain for innovative policies and intellectual innovation. We hope that this webinar, and future activities of the WGGA, will help us better address the very real damage this pandemic already has, and will continue to, inflict, as well as find opportunities for growth and innovation in the crisis. The webinar will focus on: Governance, Civil Liberties and Civil Rights The Social Economic Effects of the Pandemic and the policy responses it has elicited Upcoming Events Columbia Global CentersAmman / Beijing / Istanbul / Mumbai / Nairobi / Paris / Rio / Santiago / Tunis Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
