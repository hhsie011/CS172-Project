The areas of inquiry deal with a varied range of topics such as international trade, domestic and international financial systems, labor market analysis, and the study of less developed economies. Broadly speaking, the goal of an economics major is to train students to think analytically about social issues and, as such, provide a solid foundation for not only further study and careers in economics, but also for careers in law, public service, business, and related fields. The Economics Department offers a general economics major in addition to five interdisciplinary majors structured to suit the interests and professional goals of a heterogeneous student body. All of these programs have different specific requirements but share the common structure of core theoretical courses that provide the foundation for higher-level elective courses culminating in a senior seminar. Students are urged to carefully look through the details of each of these programs and to contact an appropriate departmental adviser to discuss their particular interests. Advanced Placement Tests must be taken in both microeconomics and macroeconomics, with a score of 5 on one test and at least a 4 on the other. Provided that this is achieved, the department grants 4 credits for a score of 4 and 5 on the AP Economics exam along with exemption from ECON UN1105 Principles of Economics . Advising The Department of Economics offers a variety of advising resources to provide prospective and current undergraduate majors and concentrators with the information and support needed to successfully navigate through the program. These resources are described below. Frequently Asked Questions Please see: http://econ.columbia.edu/frequently-asked-questions-0 As a first step, students are encouraged to visit the department's FAQ page, which provides comprehensive information and answers to the most frequently asked questions about the departmental majors and requirements. This page also includes a section that answers specific questions of first-years, sophomores, and non-majors. Graduate Student Advisers For answers to the most common questions that students have about the majors, the department has graduate student advisers, who are available by e-mail at econ-advising@columbia.edu, or during weekly office hours to meet with students. Students should direct all questions and concerns about their major to the graduate student advisers either in person or via e-mail. The graduate student advisers can discuss major requirements, scheduling, and major course selection, as well as review student checklists and discuss progress in the major. Occasionally, graduate student advisers may refer a student to someone else in the department (such as the director of undergraduate studies) or in the student's school for additional advising. Contact information and office hours for the graduate student advisers are posted on the Advisers page of the departmental website in the week prior to the beginning of the semester. Students considering one of the interdepartmental majors should speak to both a graduate student adviser from the Economics Department and the adviser from the other department early in the sophomore year. Faculty Advisers Faculty advisers are available to discuss students' academic and career goals, both in terms of the undergraduate career and post-graduate degrees and research. Students wishing to discuss these types of substantive topics may request a faculty adviser by completing the form available on the Advisers page of the departmental website and depositing it in the mailbox of the director of undergraduate studies in the department's main office, 1022 International Affairs Building. The department does its best to match students with faculty members that share similar academic interests. While faculty advisers do not discuss major requirements—that is the role of the graduate student advisers—they do provide guidance in course selection as it relates to meeting a student's intellectual goals and interests, as well as advise on career and research options. It is recommended that students who plan on attending a Ph.D. program in economics or are interested in pursuing economics research after graduation request a faculty adviser. On-Line Information Students can access useful information on-line, including: a comprehensive FAQ page; requirement changes to the major and concentration; sample programs and checklists; faculty office hours, contact information and fields of specialization; adviser information; teaching assistant information; research assistant opportunities; list of tutors; and Columbia-Barnard Economics Society information. Departmental Honors Economics majors and economics joint majors who wish to be considered for departmental honors in economics must: Have at least a 3.7 GPA in their major courses; Take ECON GU4999 Senior Honors Thesis (a one-year course); Receive at least a grade of A- in ECON GU4999 Senior Honors Thesis. Students must consult and obtain the approval of the departmental undergraduate director in order to be admitted to the workshop. Please note that ECON GU4999 Senior Honors Thesis may be taken to fulfill the seminar requirement for the economics major and all economics joint majors. Students who wish to write a senior thesis (ECON GU4999 Senior Honors Thesis) must have completed the core major requirements . Normally no more than 10% of graduating majors receive departmental honors in a given academic year. Please see the Honors Prizes page on the department's website for more information. Undergraduate Prizes All prize recipients are announced at the end of the spring semester each academic year. Sanford S. Parker Prize Established in 1980, this prize is awarded annually to a Columbia College graduating student who majored or concentrated in economics and plans on continuing his or her studies in an economics Ph.D. program within the two years following his or her graduation. The Dean’s Prize in Economics Awarded to General Studies students for excellence in the study of Economics. Romine Prize Established in 1997, this prize is awarded annually to two students (Columbia College or General Studies) majoring in economics: one for the best honors thesis paper, and the other for the best economics seminar paper.

Course List Economics Core Courses All of the core courses must be completed no later than the spring semester of the student’s junior year and must be taken at Columbia. Students who take any core course during the fall semester of their senior year must obtain written permission from the department's director of undergraduate studies. Unless otherwise specified below, all students must complete the following core courses: Course List Code Title Points ECON UN1105 Principles of Economics ECON UN3211 Intermediate Microeconomics ECON UN3213 Intermediate Macroeconomics ECON UN3412 Introduction To Econometrics Prerequisites Course prerequisites are strictly enforced. Prerequisites must be taken before the course, not after or concurrently. Economics courses taken before the completion of any of its prerequisites, even with instructor approval, are not counted toward the major, concentration, or interdepartmental majors. Exemptions from a prerequisite requirement may only be made, in writing, by the department's director of undergraduate studies. Credits from a course taken prior to the completion of its prerequisites are not counted towards the major requirements. As a consequence, students are required to complete additional, specific courses in economics at the direction of the director of undergraduate studies. The prerequisites for required courses are as follows: Course Prerequisites ECON UN1105 Principles of Economics MATH UN1101 CALCULUS I None STAT UN1201 Calculus-Based Introduction to Statistics MATH UN1101 CALCULUS I ECON UN3211 Intermediate Microeconomics ECON UN1105 Principles of Economics MATH UN1201 Calculus III or UN1205 ECON UN3213 Intermediate Macroeconomics ECON UN1105 Principles of Economics MATH UN1101 CALCULUS I Co-requisite: MATH UN1201 Calculus III or UN1205 ECON UN3412 Introduction To Econometrics MATH UN1201 Calculus III or UN1205 ECON UN3211 Intermediate Microeconomics or UN3213 STAT UN1201 Calculus-Based Introduction to Statistics ECON 2000-level electives ECON UN1105 Principles of Economics ECON GU4211 Advanced Microeconomics ECON UN3211 Intermediate Microeconomics ECON UN3213 Intermediate Macroeconomics MATH UN2010 LINEAR ALGEBRA Corequisites: MATH UN2500 ANALYSIS AND OPTIMIZATION or GU4061 ECON GU4412 Advanced Econometrics ECON GU4213 Advanced Macroeconomics ECON GU4413 Econometrics of Time Series and Forecasting ECON UN3211 Intermediate Microeconomics ECON UN3213 Intermediate Macroeconomics ECON UN3412 Introduction To Econometrics MATH UN2010 LINEAR ALGEBRA ECON UN3025 Financial Economics ECON GU4020 Economics of Uncertainty and Information ECON GU4230 Economics of New York City ECON GU4260 Market Design ECON GU4280 CORPORATE FINANCE ECON GU4370 Political Economy ECON GU4700 Financial Crises ECON GU4710 FINANCE AND THE REAL ECONOMY ECON GU4850 Cognitive Mechanisms and Economic Behavior ECON UN3211 Intermediate Microeconomics ECON UN3213 Intermediate Macroeconomics STAT UN1201 Calculus-Based Introduction to Statistics ECON GU4860 Behavioral Finance ECON UN3211 Intermediate Microeconomics ECON UN3213 Intermediate Macroeconomics ECON UN3412 Introduction To Econometrics All other ECON 3000- and 4000-level electives ECON UN3211 Intermediate Microeconomics ECON UN3213 Intermediate Macroeconomics ECON UN3901 Economics of Education ECON UN3952 Seminar in Macroeconomics and Formation of Expectations ECON UN3981 Applied Econometrics ECON GU4911 MICROECONOMICS SEMINAR ECON GU4913 MACROECONOMICS SEMINAR ECON GU4918 Seminar In Econometrics ECON UN3211 Intermediate Microeconomics ECON UN3213 Intermediate Macroeconomics ECON UN3412 Introduction To Econometrics ECPS GU4921 Seminar In Political Economy ECON UN3211 Intermediate Microeconomics ECON UN3213 Intermediate Macroeconomics ECON UN3412 Introduction To Econometrics ECON GU4370 Political Economy ECPH GU4950 Economics and Philosophy Seminar ECON UN3211 Intermediate Microeconomics ECON UN3213 Intermediate Macroeconomics ECON UN3412 Introduction To Econometrics Barnard electives See Barnard bulletin It is strongly recommended that students take ECON UN3412 Introduction To Econometrics in the semester immediately following the completion of the statistics course. Grading No course with a grade of D or lower, including calculus and statistics courses, can count toward the major, concentration, or interdepartmental majors. Economics core courses with a grade of D or F must be retaken and completed with a grade of C- or better. Students who receive a grade of D or F in a core course are permitted to take a higher-level elective course that has that core course as a prerequisite, so long as it is taken concurrently with the retaking of that core course. For example, if a student fails ECON UN3211 Intermediate Microeconomics, the student must retake it and, in the same semester, may enroll in an elective course for which it is a prerequisite, provided that all other prerequisites for the elective have been completed. The same rule applies to the required math and statistics courses. For example, if a student fails MATH UN1201 Calculus III , the student may retake calculus III concurrently with Intermediate Microeconomics. Students who must retake any core economics or math course may not retake it concurrently with a senior seminar; the economics core courses ECON UN3211 Intermediate Microeconomics , ECON UN3213 Intermediate Macroeconomics , and ECON UN3412 Introduction To Econometrics must be successfully completed before a student may enroll in a seminar. A grade of W is not equivalent to a grade of D or F; it does not qualify a student to retake the course concurrently with a higher level course that lists the course as a prerequisite. Students who receive a grade of W in a core course must complete the course with a grade of C- or better before taking a course that lists it as a prerequisite. Only ECON UN1105 Principles of Economics may be taken for a grade of Pass/D/Fail, and the student must receive a grade of P for it to count towards the requirements for the major, concentration, or interdepartmental majors. Economics Electives Only those courses identified in the Economics Department listings in this Bulletin may be taken for elective credit. All 3000-level or higher electives offered by the Economics Department have ECON UN3211 Intermediate Microeconomics and ECON UN3213 Intermediate Macroeconomics as prerequisites. However, some electives have additional prerequisites and students should ensure that all prerequisites have been completed (see the table of prerequisites printed above). Seminars do not count as electives. Seminars Seminars can be taken only after all of the required core courses in economics have been successfully completed. Students may not take or re-take ECON UN3211 Intermediate Microeconomics, ECON UN3213 Intermediate Macroeconomics, or ECON UN3412 Introduction To Econometrics concurrently with any senior seminar. Seminars do not count as electives. Each seminar is limited to sixteen students, with priority given to seniors. For ECPS GU4921 Seminar In Political Economy and ECPH GU4950 Economics and Philosophy Seminar, priority is given to economics–political science and economics-philosophy majors, respectively. For seminar registration details, read the information posted on the department's Senior Seminar Registration page: http://econ.columbia.edu/senior-seminars-registration. Mathematics Students must consult with the Mathematics Department for the appropriate placement in the calculus sequence. Students must complete one of the following sequences: Course List Code Title Points Select one of the following sequences: MATH UN1101 - MATH UN1201 CALCULUS I and Calculus III MATH UN1101 - MATH UN1205 CALCULUS I and Accelerated Multivariable Calculus MATH UN1207 - MATH UN1208 Honors Mathematics A and HONORS MATHEMATICS B In addition: Students who receive a grade of D or F in MATH UN1201 Calculus III or MATH UN1205 must retake the course, but may enroll in ECON UN3211 Intermediate Microeconomics. Students who receive a grade of D or F in MATH UN1207 Honors Mathematics A may either retake the course, or take MATH UN1201 Calculus III or MATH UN1205, and enroll in ECON UN3211 Intermediate Microeconomics concurrently. Statistics Unless otherwise specified below, all students must take STAT UN1201 Calculus-Based Introduction to Statistics, or a higher level course, such as STAT GU4204 Statistical Inference, or STAT GU4001. Barnard Courses A limited number of Barnard economics electives may count toward the major, concentration, and interdepartmental majors. Students should pay careful attention to the limit of Barnard electives indicated in their program requirements. Please see the Transfer Credit section below for information on the number of Barnard electives that may be taken to fulfill major requirements. In addition, students may receive credit for the major, concentration, and interdepartmental majors only for those Barnard economics courses listed in this Bulletin. However, students may not receive credit for two courses whose content overlaps. Barnard and Columbia economics electives with overlapping content include but are not limited to: Course List Code Title Points ECON BC3029 - ECON GU4321 Empirical Development Economics and Economic Development ECON BC3038 - ECON GU4505 International Money and Finance and International Macroeconomics ECON BC3019 - ECON GU4400 Labor Economics and Labor Economics ECON BC3047 - ECON GU4500 International Trade and International Trade ECON BC3039 - ECON GU4625 Environmental and Natural Resource Economics and Economics of the Environment ECON BC3041 - ECON GU4235 Theoretical Foundations of Political Economy and HISTORICAL FOUNDATIONS OF MODERN ECONOMICS: Adam Smith to J M Keynes ECON GU4400 Labor Economics ECON GU4235 HISTORICAL FOUNDATIONS OF MODERN ECONOMICS: Adam Smith to J M Keynes Students should always first consult with econ-advising to confirm that the Barnard elective they wish to take does not overlap with a Columbia elective that they have already taken or plan to take. Students may not take the Barnard core economics, math, statistics, or seminar courses for credit towards the completion of major requirements. School of Professional Studies Courses The Department of Economics does not accept any of the courses offered through the School of Professional Studies for credit towards the economics major, concentration, or interdepartmental majors with the exception of the courses offered by the Economics Department during the summer session at Columbia. Other Department and School Courses Please note that with the exception of the above Barnard courses and the specific courses listed below for the financial economics major, no other courses offered through the different departments and schools at Columbia count toward the economics majors or concentration. Transfer Credits Students are required to take a minimum number of courses in the Columbia Economics Department. For all majors and interdepartmental majors, students must complete a minimum of five lecture courses in the Columbia department. Students may fulfill their remaining requirements for economics lecture courses through AP (or IB or GCE) credits, Barnard electives, transfer courses, and study abroad courses (the latter two are subject to the approval of the Economics Department). The following table summarizes the new rules: Transfer Credits Program Number of required economics lecture courses Minimum number which must be taken in the department Maximum number of outside allowed Economics major 9 5 4 Financial economics 8 5 3 Economics-mathematics 7 5 2 Economics-political science 7 5 2 Economics-statistics 7 5 2 Economics-philosophy 7 5 2 Economics concentration 7 4 3 Lecture courses do not include seminars, which must be taken in the Columbia Economics Department. The lecture course counts are counts of economics courses only and do not include math, statistics, or courses in other departments; At least two of the three 3000-level economics core courses must be taken in the department and no corresponding Barnard courses are accepted. ECON UN3025 Financial Economics and ECON UN3265 MONEY AND BANKING are counted as departmental courses regardless of the instructor; Outside courses include AP (or IB or GCE) credits, transfer credits, Barnard 2000- and 3000-level elective courses and transfer credits from other universities. In the case where two or more courses taken outside of Columbia are used as the equivalent of ECON UN1105 Principles of Economics, those courses are counted as one transfer course. Approval of transfer credits to fulfill economics requirements must be obtained in writing from the Department of Economics (see the departmental website or speak with your advising dean for information regarding applications for transfer credit). Approval is granted only for courses that are considered to be comparable to those offered at Columbia. Summer courses taken at other institutions must be approved in writing by the department's transfer credit adviser before the course is taken. The department does not accept transfer credits for any 3000 level core courses taken during a summer session outside of Columbia University. Summer courses taken from the department of economics at Columbia University do not need approval. Guidelines and instructions on how to request transfer credit approval can be found in the Transfer Credit Information page of the departmental website.

The major in economics-statistics provides students with a grounding in economic theory comparable to that provided by the general economics major, but also exposes students to a significantly more rigorous and extensive statistics training than is provided by the general major. This program is recommended for students with strong quantitative skills and for those contemplating graduate studies in economics. The Department of Economics has graduate student advisers with whom students may consult on economics requirements. The Department of Statistics has an assigned adviser with whom students may consult on statistics requirements. The economics adviser can only advise on economics requirements; the statistics adviser can only advise on statistics requirements.

Prerequisites: (ECON UN3211 and ECON UN3213 and ECON UN3412) Course objective: This course has two objectives: (1) To develop students' skills in research and writing. Specifically, participants will work on: formulating a research question, placing it in the context of an existing literature and/or policy area, and using economic and econometric tools to address it in writing. Specifically, in the first part of the class, readings, problem sets, and a midterm exam will build skills in these areas. In the second part, students will come up with a research question, and address it in a research proposal/report. While all the applications will be on the economics of education, these skills will be useful in students' subsequent careers,regardless of the area of economics they focus on. (2) To provide an introduction to key issues in the economics of education. Specifically, education is a signicant industryevery person entering this course will have already spent years in this industry as a customer, as a worker, as an input, or all of the above. The course will address questions like: What does economics have to say about how this industry is organized and what determines its output? Why do individuals invest in education? What determines the behavior, productivity, and reputation of rms in the industry? What role should government and public policy (if any) play in its operation?

Prerequisites: ECON UN3211 and ECON UN3213 and ECON UN3412 This course has two main objectives: To introduce students to the process of writing a research paper. This includes identifying and formulating a research question, reviewing the previous literature and positioning the problem in that context, identifying the proper tools and data to answer the question, and finally writing the findings in the format of a research paper. An immediate goal is to prepare the students to undertake a senior thesis project. To provide an introduction to selected topics and survey evidence in macroeconomics, with a focus on the expectation formation process of economic agents. We will start by going through some canonical models that are widely used for economic and policy analysis to understand the role of expectations in the decision making of households and firms. We will then go through a series of survey data and relate the empirical evidence to the theoretical predictions of those canonical models ECON UN3981 Applied Econometrics. 3 points. Prerequisites: ECON UN3211 and ECON UN3213 and ECON UN3412 The objective of this course is to develop students' research skills and to learn the process of writing an original research paper. The skills and process include the ability to identify a problem and state in a concise manner, literature review, data collection, model formulation and estimation, evaluation of the problem and writing up the findings in a format of a research paper. An immediate and more specific goal is to prepare students to tackle a senior thesis project. Towards this goal, this course will review or introduce the most widely used econometric techniques for empirical research. These include multiple regressions, probit and logit models, instrumental variables methods, panel data methods, regression discontinuity designs. This course will also introduce some time series methods such as vector autoregressive process, cointegration analysis, financial time series, and modeling of volatilities. Students will need to practice these methods with a computer software package (R or STATA) and with actual economic data sets. ECON GU4020 Economics of Uncertainty and Information. 3 points.

Prerequisites: ECON UN3211 and ECON UN3213 and STAT UN1201 This course takes New York as our laboratory. Economics is about individual choice subject to constraints and the ways that choices sum up to something often much more than the parts. The fundamental feature of any city is the combination of those forces that bring people together and those that push them apart. Thus both physical and social space will be central to our discussions. The underlying theoretical and empirical analysis will touch on spatial aspects of urban economics, regional, and even international economics. We will aim to see these features in New York City taken as a whole, as well as in specific neighborhoods of the city. We will match these theoretical and empirical analyses with readings that reflect close observation of specific subjects. The close observation is meant to inspire you to probe deeply into a topic in order that the tools and approaches of economics may illuminate these issues in a fresh way.

Prerequisites: ECON UN3211 and ECON UN3213 Prerequisites: ECON UN3211 and ECON UN3213. Economic development is a complex and multifaceted process. Once considered a goal in itself, more recently it has become to be viewed as the fundamental means to world poverty alleviation. Today, about half of the world population still lives on less than $2 /day. Why? What does it mean to be poor? What are the forces that prevent so many people from enjoying a higher standard of living? The course opens on some fundamental macroeconomic models of economic growth and the recent debate on the geographical or institutional nature of the ultimate causes of growth or arrested development. Then we will move into the most recent microeconomic literature that sheds light on the lives of the poor and on the forces - in particular the market distortions and the market failures - that keep billions in poverty. Among others, we will discuss interesting topics like nutrition and health, the cultural origins of corruption, the effect of global warming, and the design of effective anti-poverty programs Fall 2022: ECON GU4301 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment ECON 4301 001/11888 M W 8:40am - 9:55am Room TBA Xavier Sala-I-Martin 3.00 86/96 ECON GU4321 Economic Development. 3 points.

ECON GU4625 Economics of the Environment. 3 points. Not offered during 2022-23 academic year. Prerequisites: ECON UN3211 and UN3213. Microeconomics is used to study who has an incentive to protect the environment. Government's possible and actual role in protecting the environment is explored. How do technological change, economic development, and free trade affect the environment? Emphasis on hypothesis testing and quantitative analysis of real-world policy issues. ECON GU4630 Climate Finance. 3.00 points. In lieu of the failure of legislatures to pass comprehensive carbon taxes, there is growing pressure on the financial system to address the risks of global warming. One set of pressures is to account for the heightened physical risks due to extreme weather events and potential climate tipping points. Another set of pressures are to find approaches to incentivize corporations to meet the goals set out in the Paris Treaty of 2015. These approaches include (1) mandates or restrictions to only hold companies with decarbonization plans, (2) development of negative emissions technologies such as direct-air capture and (3) promotion of natural capital markets that can be used to offset carbon emissions. Moreover, financial markets also provide crucial information on expectations and plans of economic agents regarding climate change. This course will cover both models and empirical methodologies that are necessary to assess the role of the financial system in addressing global warming ECON GU4700 Financial Crises. 3 points. Prerequisites: ECON UN3211 and ECON UN3213 and STAT UN1201 This course uses economic theory and empirical evidence to study the causes of financial crises and the effectiveness of policy responses to these crises. Particular attention will be given to some of the major economic and financial crises in the past century and to the crisis that began in August 2007. ECON GU4710 FINANCE AND THE REAL ECONOMY. 3.00 points. Prerequisites: (ECON UN3211) and (ECON UN3213) and (STAT UN1201) Prerequisites: (ECON UN3211) and (ECON UN3213) and (STAT UN1201) This course uses economic theory and empirical evidence to study the links between financial markets and the real economy. We will consider questions such as: What is the welfare role of finance? How do financial markets affect consumers and firms? How do shocks to the financial system transmit to the real economy? How do financial markets impact inequality? ECON GU4750 Globalization and Its Risks. 3 points. Prerequisites: ECON UN3211 and ECON UN3213 The world is being transformed by dramatic increases in flows of people, goods and services across nations. Globalization has the potential for enormous gains but is also associated to serious risks. The gains are related to international commerce where the industrial countries dominate, while the risks involve the global environment, poverty and the satisfaction of basic needs that affect in great measure the developing nations. Both are linked to a historical division of the world into the North and the South-the industrial and the developing nations. Key to future evolution are (1) the creation of new markets that trade privately produced public goods, such as knowledge and greenhouse gas emissions, as in the Kyoto Protocol; (2) the updating of the Breton Woods Institutions, including the creation of a Knowledge Bank and an International Bank for Environmental Settlements. ECON GU4840 BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS. 3.00 points. Prerequisites: ECON UN3211 and ECON UN3213 Prerequisites: ECON UN3211 and ECON UN3213 Within economics, the standard model of behavior is that of a perfectly rational, self interested utility maximizer with unlimited cognitive resources. In many cases, this provides a good approximation to the types of behavior that economists are interested in. However, over the past 30 years, experimental and behavioral economists have documented ways in which the standard model is not just wrong, but is wrong in ways that are important for economic outcomes. Understanding these behaviors, and their implications, is one of the most exciting areas of current economic inquiry. The aim of this course is to provide a grounding in the main areas of study within behavioral economics, including temptation and self control, fairness and reciprocity, reference dependence, bounded rationality and choice under risk and uncertainty. For each area we will study three things: 1. The evidence that indicates that the standard economic model is missing some important behavior 2. The models that have been developed to capture these behaviors 3. Applications of these models to (for example) finance, labor and development economics As well as the standard lectures, homework assignments, exams and so on, you will be asked to participate in economic experiments, the data from which will be used to illustrate some of the principals in the course. There will also be a certain small degree of classroom ‘flipping’, with a portion of many lectures given over to group problem solving. Finally, an integral part of the course will be a research proposal that you must complete by the end of the course, outlining a novel piece of research that you would be interested in doing Spring 2022: ECON GU4840 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment ECON 4840 001/13884 M W 10:10am - 11:25am 142 Uris Hall Mark Dean 3.00 58/108 ECON GU4850 Cognitive Mechanisms and Economic Behavior. 3 points. Prerequisites: ECON UN3211 and ECON UN3213 and STAT UN1201 Standard economic theory seeks to explain human behavior (especially in "economic" settings, such as markets) in terms of rational choice, which means that the choices that are made can be predicted on the basis of what would best serve some coherent objective, under an objectively correct understanding of the predictable consequences of alternative actions. Observed behavior often seems difficult to reconcile with a strong form of this theory, even if incentives clearly have some influence on behavior; and the course will discuss empirical evidence (both from laboratory experiments and observations "in the field") for some well-established "anomalies." But beyond simply cataloguing anomalies for the standard theory, the course will consider the extent to which departures from a strong version of rational choice theory can be understood as reflecting cognitive processes that are also evident in other domains such as sensory perception; examples from visual perception will receive particular attention. And in addition to describing what is known about how the underlying mechanisms work (something that is understood in more detail in sensory contexts than in the case of value-based decision making), the course will consider the extent to which such mechanisms --- while "suboptimal" from a normative standpoint that treats perfect knowledge of one's situation as costless and automatic --- might actually represent efficient uses of the limited information and bounded information-processing resources available to actual people (or other organisms). Thus the course will consider both ways in which the realism of economic analysis may be improved by taking into account cognitive processes, and ways in which understanding of cognitive processes might be advanced by considering the "economic" problem of efficient use of limited (cognitive) resources.

Prerequisites: ECON UN3211 and ECON UN3213 and ECON UN3412 Neoclassical finance theory seeks to explain financial market valuations and fluctuations in terms of investors having rational expectations and being able to trade without costs. Under these assumptions, markets are efficient in that stocks and other assets are always priced just right. The efficient markets hypothesis (EMH) has had an enormous influence over the past 50 years on the financial industry, from pricing to financial innovations, and on policy makers, from how markets are regulated to how monetary policy is set. But there was very little in prevailing EMH models to suggest the instabilities associated with the Financial Crisis of 2008 and indeed with earlier crises in financial market history. This course seeks to develop a set of tools to build a more robust model of financial markets that can account for a wider range of outcomes. It is based on an ongoing research agenda loosely dubbed “Behavioral Finance”, which seeks to incorporate more realistic assumptions concerning human rationality and market imperfections into finance models. Broadly, we show in this course that limitations of human rationality can lead to bubbles and busts such as the Internet Bubble of the mid-1990s and the Housing Bubble of the mid-2000s; that imperfections of markets — such as the difficulty of short-selling assets — can cause financial markets to undergo sudden and unpredictable crashes; and that agency problems or the problems of institutions can create instabilities in the financial system as recently occurred during the 2008 Financial Crisis. These instabilities in turn can have feedback effects to the performance of the real economy in the form of corporate investments.

Prerequisites: ECON UN3211 and ECON UN3213 and ECON UN3412 and the director of the departmental honors program's permission. Students must have a minimum GPA of 3.7 in all required major courses, including calculus and statistics, prior to enrollment. The honors thesis seminar is a year-long course, beginning in the fall semester and ending in the spring semester. Students who have been approved to enter the workshop will be registered for both semesters by the department during the first two weeks of classes; 3 points are earned per semester. This workshop may only be taken by students applying for departmental honors, and it also fulfills the economics seminar requirement for the economics major and all joint majors. Students must see the director during mid-semester registration in the spring to discuss their proposed thesis topic, at which time they will be matched with appropriate faculty who will act as their thesis adviser. Students will meet their adviser over the course of the year at mutually agreed upon times. A rough draft of the thesis will be due during the first week of February in the spring semester, and the final draft will be due three weeks before the last day of classes. Please note that for those joint majors that require two seminars, one in economics and one in the other discipline (i.e., Political Science), the economics senior honors thesis seminar only fulfills the economics seminar requirement.
