Electrical, magnetic, mechanical, optical, and structural properties are investigated. Some special topics of interest are composites, inorganic-organic hybrids, nanocomposites, organic optoelectronics, and, in relation to the structure of materials, the investigation of grain boundaries, surfaces and structural defects. Also studied are materials synthesis and processing and solid state reactions in model systems. Many faculty are involved in electronic packaging. Numerous interactions exist with other fields at Cornell. A strong catalyst for materials research activities at Cornell has been provided by the Cornell Center for Materials Research (formerly: Materials Science Center), which provides substantial financial assistance to graduate students and maintains central research facilities.

Additional information about course programs and research areas is available on request from the graduate field office. all Graduate School Requirements, including the TOEFL Exam or IELTS Academic Exam for non-native English applicants three recommendations GRE general test is optional Note: The pre-application is no longer required for this field. This change supersedes the requirements written in the paper application. Learning Outcomes The Learning Goals of the Materials Science and Engineering Ph.D. program reflect the exceptionally interdisciplinary nature of the program. The essential goal is to train candidates to be able to execute original research in Materials Science and Engineering at a world-class level. This implies that they master the fundamentals of all core materials science and engineering topics, develop in-depth understanding of the topics that are central to their research, synthesizing knowledge from different areas, and take the course-based knowledge to the research level. Here, with guidance from their mentors and peers, they apply their knowledge to solve problems of fundamental or practical interest. In addition to becoming a world expert in the area of their dissertation topics, the candidates will be prepared for a career as a professional scientist/engineer, with all the flexibility that that implies. Materials Scientists and Engineers must communicate effectively at a high level using written, oral and presentation skills. Candidates will acquire and improve these skills through course work, preparation for exams, and participation in faculty research groups. For example, MS&E 8020, the MS&E Research Seminar course, requires students to make oral presentations to members of their research group each semester. The MS&E A- and B-exams also require comprehensive skills in written and oral presentation. These formative skills are essential for the practicing Materials Scientist and Engineer. It is also essential that Materials Scientists and Engineers are aware of ethical issues pertaining to the conduct and dissemination of research, in collaborative research endeavors as well as instances that may arise concerned with the teaching arena. Opportunities to participate in training concerned with ethical issues will be provided and training must be completed by each student before his/her A-exam. The successful completion of the Responsible Conduct of Research unit online is required of all students. Learning Outcomes A candidate for a Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering is expected to demonstrate broad knowledge in the fundamental topics of Materials Science and Engineering and a deeper understanding of the topics that are central to their chosen research direction, breadth of interdisciplinary training, including relevant specialized coursework, and the ability to synthesize and create knowledge by making an original and substantial contribution to an area of Materials Science and Engineering. Learning Outcome 1: Demonstrate broad knowledge in the fundamental core topics of Materials Science and Engineering, advanced knowledge topics central to their chosen research direction, and broad interdisciplinary training. Proficiency in six core topics: Materials chemistry, Mechanical properties of materials, Materials thermodynamics, Kinetics, Electronic properties of materials, and Structure of materials Advanced knowledge in at least three core topics relevant to their research Interdisciplinary training Learning Outcome 2: Demonstrate the ability to acquire skills to perform independent advanced research. Demonstrate ability to identify and seek out resources and information; apply these to guide research plan development Demonstrate the ability to master and/or innovate research methodologies, and techniques Demonstrate oral and written communication skills Learning Outcome 3: Make an original and substantial contribution to the discipline. Demonstrate independent thinking and creativity Develop and execute original research plan Generate publishable advances in an area of Materials Science and Engineering Learning Outcome 4: Demonstrate a commitment to advancing scholarship. Maintain familiarity with advances in the field Demonstrate commitment to personal professional development through engagement in professional societies, conference participations and publications Show commitment to learning, collaborative inquiry, and mentoring Learning Outcome 5: Demonstrate professional skills. Understand and maintain ethical standards in the field Listen, give, and receive feedback effectively Admissions Degrees & Fields Fields of Study – Graduate Catalog Understanding the Field Structure Graduate Degrees Explore Non-Degree Admissions Faculty Research and Scholarship Prepare Required Tests Recommendations Academic Statement of Purpose Personal Statements Transcript Requirements International Degree Equivalencies English Language Proficiency Requirement Admissions Review Considering COVID-19 Disruptions Apply Important Application Policies Application Fees Admissions Costs for International Students Apply Now Application Status Accepting, Deferring, and Reapplying Funding and Next Steps Admitted Students You Belong at Cornell Navigating Graduate School Resources for First-Year Students Living in Ithaca Visiting and Getting Around Housing Housing Tips Dining Admissions and Admitted Student FAQ Contact Graduate Admissions Financial Support Tuition Rates Tuition Rates by Field Health Insurance Rates Cost of Attendance Reduced Tuition for Advanced Self-Pay Doctoral Students Assistantships Fellowships New Student Fellowships Continuing Student Fellowships Presidential Life Science Fellowship External Fellowships List of External Fellowships Letters of Recommendation Writing Your Research Statement Financial Supplementation of External Fellowships NSF GRFP Fellowship Loans Stipend Rates Tax Information Understanding the 1098-T Form Preparing Taxes Travel Funding Opportunities Academic Progress Requirements Academic Structure Getting Registered Enrolling in Courses Finding Administrative Help Making Academic Progress Nominating Your Special Committee Advancing to Doctoral Candidacy Defending Your Thesis or Dissertation Taking Exams Petitioning for Exceptions Responsible Conduct of Research Student Progress Review Changing Your Committee Changing Your Field or Program Changing Your Status Educational Opportunities Off Campus Faculty Guide to Advising Research Degree Students Mentoring Remotely During Disruption Advising Guide for Research Students Advising Guide for Professional Students Office of Academic and Student Affairs Academic Writing Programs Fellowship Workshops Fellowship Application Tips Productive Fellowship Writer Writing and Publishing Workshop Series Interdisciplinary Research and Ethics Programs Three Minute Thesis 3MT 2022 3MT 2021 3MT 2019 3MT 2018 3MT 2017 Promoting Your Research with Compelling Communication (aka, 3MT and Beyond!)

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
