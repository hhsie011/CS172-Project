Introductory courses provide an overview of the field of geography, and ground students in the fundamentals of geography. Methods courses impart the qualitative and quantitative tools that geographers use to explore people and environment in space. Breadth courses expose students to the diversity of geography as a discipline. Depth courses allow students to more substantively engage an area of interest. Finally, the culminating experience synthesizes students' knowledge of geography through deep discussions of key and current literature in a seminar format. The Department of Geography also offers a Geography Minor, a Geography Major Modified, Major Modification with Geography, an Urban Studies Minor, and a Climate Change Science Minor.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Geography Undergraduate Major, Minor and Modifications Courses Culminating Experience Senior Honors Thesis Awards Careers Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Research Overview Faculty Research Student Research Postdoctoral Fellowships Facilities Off-Campus Study News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
