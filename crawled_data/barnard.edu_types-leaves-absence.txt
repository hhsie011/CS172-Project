Students seeking to return from a general leave, and who do not require any kind of medical clearance, need to fill out the Request to Return form. The Request to Return form is now online! If your Barnard login credentials are not currently active, please submit the Intent to Return form first to start the process of reactivating your Barnard account. Once your credentials are reactivated, submit the new Request to Return form by the November 1 deadline for a spring return, or June 1 for a fall return. Students returning from medical/mental health leave of absence should submit both the online request to return form and the medical/mental health return form (this one is still a pdf/paper form). (Please note: Request for Return from a general leave will not require scheduling an interview with a specific office on campus unless otherwise noted on the form; an interview with the Case Manager may be specified, and these should take place prior to the semester of return.) Medical/Mental Health Leave Students who must interrupt their studies temporarily due to physical or psychological condition must notify the College Case Manager. Students must submit a completed Medical Leave Request form, in addition to a Notice of Leave of Absence form. Note: In order to complete the writable PDF form, please download, save the file and open with Adobe Acrobat. The form must be signed by a medical or mental health professional, who recommends a leave of absence for specific reasons. Students on medical or mental health leave must demonstrate that they will pursue medical or mental health treatment, as indicated, to address the noted condition during their time away from the College. The Executive Director of Student Health and Wellness must meet with students pursuing a medical or mental health leave. The College Case Manager, in consultation with other deans and Primary Health Care Services or Furman Counseling, will review each case and help the student to file paperwork. The Medical Leave Request Forms must be turned in to Primary Health Care Services within 30 days of the date of the student's departure from campus. Students who are unable to meet the 30-day deadline must be in touch in a timely fashion with the College Case Manager; students who do not turn in their forms within the appropriate time frame may delay the process for return, and may be asked to seek return at a later date. Degree progress and financial aid implications should be considered as part of a decision to leave and return. Required Leave Students who do not meet the requirements for satisfactory academic progress, or who are not in good academic standing, for two consecutive semesters, may be asked to leave the college for a specified time. The Committee on Programs and Academic Standing meets to review student records twice a year, and the Committee determines the length of leave time and the conditions for return. Good academic standing is defined as maintaining a 2.0 GPA each semester and attempting or earning at least 12 credits each semester; satisfactory academic progress (or SAP) is defined as the above PLUS the evidence that a student is earning the appropriate annual number of credits necessary to achieve their class standing and meet the 122 required credits for graduation. Students who fail to meet these requirements and who are placed on leave may be required to take coursework while on leave. Students on academic leave should remain in contact with the College Case Manager to make arrangements during their leave, and for their return.
