She has been conducting research on the sense of smell, emotion, perception, motivated behavior and cognition since 1990. Dr. Herz is a TEDx speaker, has published over 85 original research papers, received numerous awards and grants, co-authored scholarly handbooks. In addition to being an Adjunct Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, she is a faculty member for the Food Studies program at Brown University, and part-time faculty in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience at Boston College. Rachel Herz is also a professional consultant to various industries regarding scent, taste, food and flavor, and is frequently called upon as an expert witness in legal cases involving olfaction. Dr. Herz is the author of several academic and popular science books including the leading college textbook on Sensation & Perception (Oxford University Press) now in its 5th edition, The Scent of Desire: Discovering Our Enigmatic Sense of Smell (2007; Harper Collins), which was selected as a finalist for the “2009 AAAS Prize for Excellence in Science Books,” That’s Disgusting: Unraveling the Mysteries of Repulsion (2012; W.W. Norton & Co), which analyzes the emotion of disgust from culture to neuroscience, and was listed as a New York Times Book Review Editor’s Choice. Her latest book Why You Eat What You Eat: The Science Behind Our Relationship with Food (2018; W.W. Norton & Co) explores how our senses, brain and psychology govern our perception of food, and the experiences and consequences of eating. Why You Eat What You Eat was a finalist for the “2018 Readable Feast Awards” and listed among the “Best Food Books of 2018” by The Smithsonian and The New Yorker. Dr. Herz is currently working on a children’s book about how the senses interact with our experience of food.

Full Text PubMed Research Research Overview The main focus of my work has been on sensory perception, primarily the sense of smell and how it influences and is mediated by and influences emotion, learning and memory, and social behavior. Recently I have begun to explore the emotion of disgust, bitter taste perception, circadian changes in taste and smell sensitivity, and the psychology of food. Research Statement Dr. Herz has been conducting research on olfaction, emotion and sensory cognition since 1990 and is considered to be one of the world's leading experts on the psychology of smell. Her research has shown how odor-evoked memory is emotionally unique and evocative compared to other memory experiences, how emotional associations can change odor perception, and how odors can be conditioned to emotions and subsequently influence motivated behavior. Her work also addresses how language and context alter olfactory perception, the role of body-odor and fragrance in heterosexual attraction, and mechanisms involved in scent-marketing. Her recent experiments involve studying the connection between the sense of taste, language and the emotion of disgust as experienced morally versus viscerally. She is also currently involved in research examining changes in taste and smell sensitivity as a function of BMI aand sleep and circadian phase, and investigating numerous facets of how sensory perception, our thoughts and moods influence food consumption, and how tastes can affect person perception.

Monell Chemical Senses Cen, 1994-2000 Teaching Teaching Overview The Psychology of Aversion PY1520, CLPS1550 In this seminar we explore what is aversive to us and why. In particular, the ways in which sensory perception (e.g., smell, taste, vision), cognition, culture, personal experience and neurobiology mediate our avoidance responses will be analyzed. The purpose of avoidance from an evolutionary perspective and how the emotion of disgust is uniquely human will be a theme throughout the course. Topics to be dealt with will range from neuropsychological disorders to our social behavior and morality. Additionally, why we are attracted to stimuli that "should" inspire avoidance (e.g., horror movies, roller coaster rides) will be examined. Students will acquire a broad knowledge of the psychology of aversion through course readings, discussions, projects and active participation. In addition to presentations and discussion, class time activities may include completing questionnaires, watching videos and assessing various sensory stimuli. The course is not lecture format. Students are required to actively participate in seminar discussions. About Help Brown University Feedback © 2017 Brown University | Terms of Use | Powered by VIVO
