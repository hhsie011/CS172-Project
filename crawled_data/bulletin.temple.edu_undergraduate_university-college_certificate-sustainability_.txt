This undergraduate certificate provides an opportunity for students to advance their knowledge of sustainability from the orientation of different disciplines, to introduce them to concepts of systems thinking to make them more competitive in a job market that increasingly is requiring sustainability expertise and skills. Students will select from an existing array of courses in various disciplines. A faculty committee will regularly review new courses proposed by the schools and colleges to be included in available offerings for the certificate. The certificate is available to all undergraduate degree seeking students to complete as part of their studies. Consult a school academic advisor about how the required classes fit into academic and career plans. This credit certificate may be conferred upon a student upon satisfactory completion of the required credits with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0. For questions about the Certificate in Sustainability contact: sustainabilitycertificate@temple.edu. Certificate Requirements The undergraduate Certificate in Sustainability will require four (4) courses and a minimum of twelve (12) credit hours. The four courses will be selected as follows: One course (or 3 credits) from the Sustainable Environment category (SE). One course (or 3 credits) from the Sustainable Social and Culture category (SS). One course (or 3 credits) from the Sustainable Economics and Politics category (SP). The final course taken will be Sustainability in Action (UC 3101). One course may be from the student's major department if it is not fulfilling a requirement within that major. General Education courses can be included in the array of courses, but can constitute no more than one of the four courses toward the certificate. The certificate courses in sustainability can satisfy other minors and/or certificates.
