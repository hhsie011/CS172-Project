Gain Hands-On Experience in Disaster Preparedness, Response and Recovery Efforts The BA in Emergency Management prepares you to become a future emergency management leader through providing a well-rounded curriculum that covers the fundamental skills, theoretical understanding and knowledge needed to succeed in the industry. Your coursework will offer a deeper understanding about how to support organizations and communities in the preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery efforts of disaster situations while emphasizing ethical decision making, resilience and social responsibility. As an emergency management major, you’ll be required to complete a minor. Many students choose from areas such as public administration, urban and regional planning and nonprofit management. You may also select a minor outside of the School of Public Administration that has been approved by the undergraduate program coordinator.

Upon graduation, pursue an entry-level position within crisis and disaster preparedness and response in government, healthcare, military, education, nonprofits and private organizations such as banks and theme parks. You may also go on to obtain the Certified Emergency Manager credential — which accepts a bachelor’s degree in lieu of experience — to gain an edge on the competition. Highlights The emergency management program at UCF is the first undergraduate degree of its kind in the state of Florida. Partnerships with local government agencies provide opportunities for students to intern and participate in training exercises in live emergency operations centers.
