Our concentrators undertake an academically rigorous course of study which advances knowledge and discovery to prepare students to succeed in a complex and changing world. Research experiences and coursework reflect Brown's intellectual independence: students choose courses and research groups based on their own individual interests and goals. Brown's Open Curriculum allows students to discover advanced—even graduate-level—courses where chemistry meets biology, medicine, physics, nanoscience, and engineering. Working alongside graduate students and faculty, concentrators actively engage in research from the start of their Brown careers. A Welcome letter to the Class of 2026! Welcome to Chemistry @ Brown! Interested in Keeping Informed about Our General Chemistry Course, CH0330? Excellent! If so, feel free to provide your contact information for emails about syllabi, materials, videos, and problem sets to help you prepare, and the placement exam via this Google Form: https://forms.gle/g2A27v8S9LY1F58h9 . Learn more about the Chemistry Placement Exam here. Learn more about our CHEM-Web tutorial here. Undergraduate [email protected]: A Quick Start Guide Students who have AP or IB scores on record with the Registrar's Office do not need to take this placement exam. Please make sure that you add all four components to your cart: S01 - Lecture - online C01 - C06 - conference section - online L01-L10 - lab section - online M01 - Common Meeting - this component does not meet and links the lab with the lecture. If you continue to have registration issues, please email [email protected] If you have any questions, please direct them to Prof. Brenda Rubenstein. Our Concentrations The Sc.B. degrees in each of these concentrations provide a thorough foundation for further graduate study or for entry-level technical positions in each area. Sc.B. Chemistry / A.B. Chemistry: Students seeking the Sc.B. may either pursue the standard Chemistry concentration or one of the two optional tracks: Chemical Biology or Materials Chemistry. Students may also pursue the A.B. degree, which provides a core education in the discipline. View Course Requirements Contact Concentration Advisors: Prof. Amit Basu & Prof. Eunsuk Kim See Alumni Data See Chemistry Concentrators Checklist Sc.B. Biochemistry: How does life work at the molecular level? This question is at the core of the concentration program in Biochemistry. Offered jointly with MCB. View Course Requirements Please email [email protected] for any concentration related questions and to be assigned a Biochemistry concentration advisor. Sc.B. Chemical Physics: The concentration provides students with a broad-based understanding in fundamental molecular sciences, as well as a background for graduate studies in physical chemistry, chemical physics, or molecular engineering. Offered jointly with Physics. View Course Requirements Contact Concentration Advisor: Prof. Richard Stratt See Alumni Data Research Undergraduate students at all levels (first-years, sophomores, juniors, seniors) are actively involved in research with the more than 20 faculty members in the department. In addition, our concentrators do research in departments across the university, such as Cell Biology & Biochemistry, Molecular Pharmacology & Biotechnology, and clinical departments within the Alpert Medical School.
