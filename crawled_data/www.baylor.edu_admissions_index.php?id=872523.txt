The program's popular feature is that general electives may also meet entrance requirements for professional schools. This is especially helpful in those instances where Baylor University does not have a pre-professional degree program in the field a student is interested in. Course available include: Intervention Design in Public and Community Health Stress Management/Mental-Emotional Health Leisure and Lifestyle Well-Being Anatomical Kinesiology Research Methods and Design in Exercise Science The major has a wide diversity of subject matter. It provides students the opportunity to work in career areas of health, fitness, recreation or sports. Students also often pursue graduate school after completing the degree. The Robbins College of Health and Human Sciences offers several study abroad programs. A unique study abroad experience is available for health-related degrees every summer. Baylor in Brazil is a 30 day program in which a group of students travel to several places working with local programs to promote health while taking classes.
