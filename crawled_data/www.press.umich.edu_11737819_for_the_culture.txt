Bonnette-Bailey and Adolphus G. Belk, Jr., Editors Examines the relationship between social justice, Hip-Hop culture, and resistance Description Series Music and Social Justice For the Culture: Hip-Hop and the Fight for Social Justice documents and analyzes the ways in which Hip-Hop music, artists, scholars, and activists have discussed, promoted, and supported social justice challenges worldwide. Drawing from diverse approaches and methods, the contributors in this volume demonstrate that rap music can positively influence political behavior and fight to change social injustices, and then zoom in on artists whose work has accomplished these ends. The volume explores topics including education and pedagogy; the Black Lives Matter movement; the politics of crime, punishment, and mass incarceration; electoral politics; gender and sexuality; and the global struggle for social justice. Ultimately, the book argues that Hip-Hop is much more than a musical genre or cultural form: Hip-Hop is a resistance mechanism. Lakeyta M. Bonnette-Bailey is Associate Professor of African American Studies at Georgia State University. Adolphus G. Belk, Jr. is Professor of Political Science and African American Studies at Winthrop University. Praise / Awards “An absolutely fascinating edited volume that pushes the academic field of inquiry in very real ways. This book will be bought, cited regularly, and provide maps to future Hip-Hop studies.” —Lavar Pope, author of Rap and Politics: A Case Study of Panther, Gangster, and Hyphy Discourses in Oakland, CA (1965–2010) “This is a richly varied set of perspectives on the power of Hip-Hop to contribute to social justice movements around the world. It clearly advocates for Hip-Hop, but at the same time does not shy away from critique. I am excited to see such fascinating and compelling discussions of Hip-Hop as related to the criminal (in)justice system, higher education, and indigeneity.” —Mark Katz, author of Build: The Power of Hip Hop Diplomacy in a Divided World News, Reviews, Interviews Watch: Adolphus Belk interviewed on the Paul Finebaum show about Juneteenth and For the Culture | 6/18/21 You May Also Be Interested In Critical Excess i used to love to dream Performing Commemoration Queer Voices in Hip Hop Product Details DOI: 10.3998/mpub.11737819 6 x 9. 346pp. 1 illustration, 5 charts, 3 tables.
