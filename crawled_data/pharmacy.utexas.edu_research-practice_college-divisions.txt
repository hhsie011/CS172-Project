Our students build on a rigorous foundation of enzymology and bioorganic chemistry to develop novel tools to understand health and disease at the level of chemical mechanisms and to develop the next generation of therapeutics. Health Outcomes Research and training in this track is focused on the evaluation of pharmacists’ services, pharmaceutical products, other healthcare services and interventions, and patient behaviors. Research is conducted in the following areas: Health Behavior Theory and the Medication Use Process; Health Services Research (utilization and expenditures for medications and other healthcare services); Pharmacoeonomics (including Quality of Life); Pharmacoepidemiology; and Public Health and Disease Prevention. Molecular Pharmaceutics & Drug Delivery Molecular Pharmaceutics and Drug Delivery is comprised of those disciplines that are involved with dosage forms in pharmaceutical practice. Sub-disciplines within pharmaceutics include: Formulation Science in which physics and chemistry are used to prepare effective dosage forms, Biopharmaceutics in which the interactions between the dosage form, itself, and various biological factors in the persons taking the dosage form are studied, and Pharmacokinetics in which the time course of drugs in the body and the factors influencing the time course are studied analytically and mathematically. Pharmacology & Toxicology Pharmacology and Toxicology studies encompass drug discovery, their mechanisms of action, chemical properties, and the deleterious effects of drugs and toxicants on biological systems. In this track, students select from one of two sub-tracks: neuropharmacology (how drugs act on the brain) or mechanistic molecular toxicology (cellular and biochemical events associated with the adverse effects of drugs, toxicants, and chemicals). Pharmacotherapy The mission of the Division of Pharmacotherapy is to train and educate pharmacists and pharmaceutical scientists to provide specialty pharmacotherapeutic services including primary care and to conduct translational, transdisciplinary and other types of innovative research. The Division also holds with equal value its efforts in the areas of research, practice, and education. Pharmacy Practice The focus of the Division of Pharmacy Practice is excellence in innovative Pharm.D. teaching through didactic, interprofessional, experiential, and service-based learning experiences. Students learn by serving patients and the community through clinical practice and outstanding patient care. Our mission is to provide exemplary education, training, research, and professional development in the pharmaceutical sciences; to advance discovery, innovation, and patient care; and to provide service to the university, professional and scientific communities, and society.
