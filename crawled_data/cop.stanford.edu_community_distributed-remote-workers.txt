We’ll discuss best practices for working as a distributed or remote worker and collaborating with remote/distributed teams in an interactive way. We’ll bring you the latest technology being used across campus, and elsewhere that helps keep us together no matter where we are. And finally, we want to engage with you, the Stanford Community to learn how we can keep this community feeling connected to the Stanford culture. We want to encourage the community to remember that no matter where we are in the world, we are passionate Stanford Staffers committed to closing the gap of what it “feels” like to work with remote workers and distributed teams.
