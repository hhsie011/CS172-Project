National Science Foundation Science and Technology Centers The National Science Foundation (NSF) established the Science and Technology Centers (STC) Program in 1987. The objective, in response to rising global competition, was to mount an innovative, interdisciplinary attack in important areas of basic research. The first STCs were established in 1989, more were added in 1991, and in a few short years they have grown from a new idea into a vital network of programs. The STC Program is administered through the Office of Science and Technology Infrastructure at NSF.
