This combined degree program offers exceptional students an opportunity to work closely with faculty, while developing critical skills in public health and completing graduate work for professional careers in research, policy, administration, or real-world public health practice. The public health curriculum at Temple University is diverse, offering both undergraduate and graduate students access to faculty from a broad range of public health areas. The MPH requirements will be satisfied by the end of the fifth year of study. The undergraduate program consists of 110 undergraduate credits and the graduate program consists of 39 graduate credits, for a total of 149 credits. The +1 Accelerated BS in Public Health/MPH program is currently available with our MPH in Applied Biostatistics, MPH in Epidemiology, MPH in Health Policy and Management and MPH in Social and Behavioral Sciences programs.
