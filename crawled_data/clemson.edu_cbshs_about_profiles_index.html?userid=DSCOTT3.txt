Travers Scott is an author and educator interested in identities, particularly related to gender, sexuality, health, and technology. He has authored five books, (co)edited two, and published over 150 short pieces. A cultural producer and analyst, he has published fiction and creative nonfiction since 1989, and academic writing since 1997. Seeing the marginal outlets of outsider voices as equally important to authoritative sources, he has published in outlets ranging from underground ‘zines to scholarly journals. For 13 years he straddled professional work in advertising—for clients such as AT&T Wireless, Netflix, and Microsoft—with performing in the USA, Canada, and Australia—his work profiled in Harper’s magazine and This American Life. He holds a BFA in Writing and Performance from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, a Master of Communication in Digital Media from the University of Washington, and a PhD in Communication from the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California. Research Interests The communication of identity is the unifying inquiry across my active, interdisciplinary research program. Subjective processes of identity management as well as social processes of identification are the core of my scholarship, with emphases on gender/sexuality, health, and an innovative conception of technology users as an identity category, deploying a critical/cultural approach of combining qualitative, interpretive, and historiographic methods. As an interdisciplinary scholar, my research trajectory engages in conversations carried out in and across various academic fields. While maintaining a focus on communication, I respond to and work with scholars in cultural studies, American studies, history, feminist, gender, and sexuality studies; and other areas.
