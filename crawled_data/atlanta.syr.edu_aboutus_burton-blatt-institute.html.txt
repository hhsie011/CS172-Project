BBI builds on the legacy of Burton Blatt, former dean of SU’s School of Education and a pioneering disability rights scholar, to better the lives of people with disabilities. Lexington, KY is home to BBI Southeast, one of four offices operated by the Burton Blatt Institute at Syracuse University. Other offices are in Syracuse, NY, Washington, D.C., and Atlanta, GA. Serving an eight-state region that includes Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee, BBI Southeast is comprised of one federally-funded project: Southeast ADA Center—provides information, training, and guidance on the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and disability access tailored to the needs of business, government, and individuals at local, state, and regional levels. The center also conducts research to reduce and eliminate barriers to employment and economic self-sufficiency, and to increase the civic and social participation of Americans with disabilities.
