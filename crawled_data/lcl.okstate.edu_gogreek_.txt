Zeta Tau Alpha Welcome to Fraternity & Sorority Affairs Welcome to the Oklahoma State University Fraternity & Sorority Affairs web site! The OSU fraternity and sorority community is comprised of members of both men's and women's fraternities and sororities. While fraternity and sorority life at Oklahoma State University began over one hundred years ago, its impact continues to flourish on campus. Today, over 5,000 students are strong and vital members of the community. We are proud to have a thriving system on campus with numerous, diverse nationally recognized fraternities and sororities represented. Fraternity and sorority membership offers students a unique opportunity to have a balanced college life with a focus on academic excellence, brotherhood/sisterhood, leadership development, community service and responsible social interaction. Greek affiliation also allows students to make lasting friendships with individuals with similar ideals and common purposes.
