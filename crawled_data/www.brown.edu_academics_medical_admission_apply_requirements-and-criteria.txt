The Medical Admissions Committee seeks applicants who will become leaders and role models in the practice of medicine and the advancement of human health. The Committee especially values intellectual curiosity, prior experience in research or the clinical realm, a demonstrated commitment to serving others, integrity, and enthusiasm. All applicants must present a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.00 (on a 4.00 scale). Applicants who have not yet completed a baccalaureate degree may apply to The Warren Alpert Medical School; however, the baccalaureate degree program must be completed prior to matriculation. The Warren Alpert Medical School welcomes applications from candidates with backgrounds underrepresented in the field of medicine, as well as those with military service. As of September 2021, 27% of the M.D. program student body came from groups underrepresented in medicine. “ Brown University does not discriminate on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, age, disability, status as a veteran, national or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. ” We also welcome Rhode Island residents to apply. Most of our Rhode Island students apply during or after their college years through the American Medical Collage Application Service (AMCAS), but we also have Rhode Islanders here with us who applied through our other routes of admission. The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University considers transfer applications only under extraordinary or highly compelling circumstances, and on a space available basis. Only students enrolled in U.S. medical schools can be considered. Please see our Advanced Standing/Transfer Policy for details. Course Requirements The following minimum coursework ensures competence in the sciences basic to medicine and sufficient to provide adequate preparation for medical school, and must be completed prior to matriculation. Demonstrated competence in an area through more advanced coursework or employment in a scientific environment may also be accepted. Quantitative Reasoning One course in calculus or statistics (biostatistics preferred) Biology Two courses with a grade of B or higher, covering cell biology and genetics (lab experience is highly recommended) Chemistry Two courses in general (inorganic) chemistry, one course in organic chemistry, and one course in biochemistry Physics Two-course sequence covering mechanics, heat, electricity, optics, and radiation physics Writing While there is no specific course requirement, strong writing skills are expected. Courses that involve substantial expository writing (e.g., English, philosophy, history) can enhance writing skills. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, for coursework taken in 2020, pass/fail and on-line coursework will be accepted without prejudice. With the exception of biology, where two courses must be taken in college, Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) courses that were accepted for course credit at your degree-granting institution will be accepted as fulfilling the requirements listed above if properly noted on your undergraduate transcript and listed on the AMCAS application. Those who have AP credit for introductory biology can choose among other biology courses. Eligibility Individuals who are enrolled in or graduates of accredited institutions of higher education in the United States and Canada are eligible to apply. Applicants must have completed the majority of the premedical course requirements within the previous 10 years. Applicants who have previously been dismissed, withdrawn, or already graduated from a medical school will be considered ineligible to apply to Alpert Medical School. Applicants to AMS may apply a maximum of three times. Alpert Medical School considers international applicants who have completed a minimum of one year of coursework in an accredited school in the United States or Canada and who meet all the other premedical course requirements. Funding is limited, and information regarding personal and family financial resources is requested prior to an interview. As an international candidate, you would not be eligible for federally subsidized programs, nor would you be eligible for Alpert Medical School need-based institutional funding, although you may be eligible for limited merit-based funding. Other schools may have more substantial institutional funding available. You should also research outside sources of funding. The financial aid office website has resources on scholarships and loan opportunities. External Scholarships & Loan Opportunities Alpert Medical School accepts applications from Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) candidates. Some institutional funding may be available but would not cover the full cost of attendance. DACA candidates are currently ineligible for federally subsidized loan programs and therefore are encouraged to seek outside sources of funding. Technical Standards Students applying to the medical degree-granting program at Brown University must be capable of meeting the competency requirements expected of all graduates, with or without reasonable accommodation, described in the Student Policies Handbook. Technological compensation can be made for some disabilities in certain of these competency requirements. Candidates accepted for admission who will need special accommodations cannot matriculate unless those supportive services are available, as determined by the Dean of Medicine and Biological Sciences.
