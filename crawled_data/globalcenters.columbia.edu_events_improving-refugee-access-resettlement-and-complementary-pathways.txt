3:00 PM Columbia Global Centers | Amman Columbia Global Centers | Amman, in partnership with Durable Solutions Platform, is organizing a seminar with the objective of establishing a better understanding among stakeholders of how to improve the access to resettlement and complimentary pathways for Syrian refugees in the Middle East. The seminar is made up of sessions where researchers will share preliminary findings of their studies on resettlement and complementary pathways among key stakeholders in refugee protection. Discussions will take place on the implications of the research findings on humanitarian programming and advocacy. Objectives Establish a better understanding among stakeholders of how to improve the access to resettlement and complementary pathways for Syrian refugees in the Middle East, by: Sharing preliminary findings of research studies on resettlement and complementary pathways among key stakeholders involved in refugee protection Discussing the implications of the research findings on humanitarian programming and advocacy Background As in all refugee crises, UNHCR aims to implement three durable solutions to enable displaced people to rebuild their lives. Traditionally, these solutions have included voluntary repatriation (when safe), resettlement to a third country, and local integration. Unfortunately for most refugees, integration and safe return home are not always feasible options. With this in mind, alongside the conflict’s increasing protraction, third country resettlement becomes more important as a possible durable solution for Syrian refugees. However, less than 1 % of all refugees are actually resettled in third countries. This leaves 5.2 million Syrian refugees in the Middle East with limited options. To address this needs gap, complementary pathways have been developed as a legal and regulated means to support refugees achieving normalcy of life and a solution to displacement. Complementary pathways include humanitarian visas, private sponsorships, family reunification, and opportunities for labour mobility and education. However, little is known about the extent to which complementary pathways improve the likelihood of refugees accessing and achieving a durable solution. Columbia Global Centers | Amman and Durable Solutions Platform (DSP) aim to organize this seminar to share findings of recently completed research on resettlement and complementary pathways for Syrian refugees in the Middle East. This one day seminar will include a morning plenary session and an afternoon of breakout sessions that allow participants to reflect on ways to apply new knowledge to the improvement of policy and practice.
