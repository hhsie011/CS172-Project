The renovation for student commons at Andrews Hall converted the existing 61x100 ft dining hall and a portion of the terrace level residential hall into a student center and 24-hour study center. The scope of work included two food serveries, meeting spaces, dining areas and outdoor dining space on the lower floor. The dining hall, preserved as a large open space, now has a variety of furniture including high top dining tables and chairs, banquettes, sofas and other various types of lounge seating. The upper level includes the 24-hour study center facing an outdoor terrace with seating. The space includes lounge seating and furniture for studying, a printing center, and meeting room. Both levels are linked together with a central stair. In addition, there are outdoor dining and study spaces on both levels with a large gas-fired fireplace on the terrace level.
