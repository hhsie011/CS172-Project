Clemson University’s M.S. in Athletic Leadership is designed for aspiring and in-career professionals interested in coaching and athletic administration at the intercollegiate level. This program helps students create individualized coaching philosophies and further develop fundamental coaching skills in the areas of leadership, diversity, ethics, and policy. The majority of students work in intercollegiate athletic positions or have direct responsibilities within the educational setting of working with student athletes. Students in the program are commonly (but not limited to) new professionals, graduate assistant coaches, athletic trainers, strength and conditioning coaches, student athlete academic service providers, student affair professionals and athletic administrators at various roles. Program Handbook Program Brochure Faculty Directory Academic Calendar Apply Now Overview The Athletic Leadership (AL) program in Clemson University’s College of Education is moving forward to address the need of leadership development and ethical decision making in the intercollegiate athletic coaching and administrative community. The purpose of the AL master’s degree will be to provide current and aspiring coaches and administrators, especially those at the intercollegiate level, an opportunity to obtain a graduate degree that focuses on leadership, ethics and coaching development within the current landscape of athletics in educational settings. This program will be developed to promote personal and professional growth in leadership, coaching integrity, and community influence. The need for strong and effective leaders within the intercollegiate athletic community provides Clemson’s athletic leadership program an opportunity to impact the future of college athletics through education, philosophical coaching development, leadership development and student athlete development. The athletic leadership graduate program affords students the opportunity to receive a comprehensive discipline of study that (1) develops effective leaders in the fields of coaching and athletic administration; and (2) expands on the body of knowledge regarding ethical decision making, policy regulations and leadership at the intercollegiate setting. This program meets the needs of students who are also working professionals. All courses are offered in an online format and designed around the time constraints and responsibilities of the intercollegiate coaching community. If you are accepted into the program, you will progress through the program by enrolling in two courses (taken consecutively) each term and complete the program in two years. Throughout this process, students will interact with instructors and students electronically in both synchronous (at the same time) and asynchronous (at different times) formats. While the program provides a great deal of flexibility to meet the need of the coaching profession, students are responsible for allocating sufficient time in your schedules to access course material, review lectures, study content materials and complete assignments. Program Goals The goal of the Athletic Leadership Master’s degree is designed to prepare coaches and administrators to build a philosophical foundation of leadership by equipping them with knowledge related to: Leadership Theories Student Athlete Development Ethical Decision Making Policies and Governance of Intercollegiate Athletics Marketing and Finance of Intercollegiate Athletics Psychological Components of Athletic Performance Community Influence Admission Requirements Admission to the Program The Athletic Leadership master’s program admits students for spring and fall entrance terms.
