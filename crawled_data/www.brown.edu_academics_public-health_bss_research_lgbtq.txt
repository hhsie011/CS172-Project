Sexual and gender minority groups experience health disparities as a result of multiple socio-cultural factors. Studies have shown that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) populations have higher prevalence of life-threatening physical and mental health conditions, experience greater barriers to health care access, and face substantial threats to quality of life compared to their heterosexual counterparts. Current research is being conducted on: the impact of social policies on LGBT health; behavioral research on the sexual transmission of infectious diseases; interventions to decrease sexual risk for HIV and other STIs as well as to decrease substance use and other psychosocial problems, such as depression, among men who have sex with men and transgender individuals; examining the impact of sexual minority stressors on health outcomes; interventions for same sex couples that address the role of relationship dynamics on sexual health; research on LGBT families and households; and demographic aspects of LGBT health, morbidity, disability, and mortality.
