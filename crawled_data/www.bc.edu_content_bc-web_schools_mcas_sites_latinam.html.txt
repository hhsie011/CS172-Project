It is a region with more people than Europe; a larger economy than China; and a history deeply intertwined with the history of Spain, Portugal, other European nations, and the United States in particular. Latin American Studies (LAS) will challenge your preconceptions, enrich your imagination, and deepen your understanding of the world.
