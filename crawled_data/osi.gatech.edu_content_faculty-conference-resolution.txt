You are here: GT Home Home For Faculty Faculty Conference Resolution What is a Faculty Conference Resolution (FCR)? A faculty member can choose to address a potential violation of the Academic Honor Code on their own if they choose. A meeting between the primary instructor and the accused student(s) can be mutually arranged to reach a resolution. This resolution then gets reported to the Office of Student Integrity (OSI) upon completion. Checklist of Procedure: Email the student and the the Assistant Director of OSI (andrew.lawrence@studentlife.gatech.edu), within 5 days of suspicion of academic misconduct Meet with student to conduct FCR process Student must be given the opportunity to decline the FCR process at any point Student must read section F.3. of the Student Code of Conduct Student Rights Faculty member explains why they believe the student's work or actions violate policy Supporting materials (if applicable) for the allegation(s) are reviewed with the student Student can present documentation, witnesses, and other supporting information the student deems relevant If a student accepts responsibility, the Faculty member can institute a disciplinary warning and a maximum grade penalty of a zero on the assignment. The resolution would be forwarded to OSI using the online incident referral form. If the student accepts responsibility for a violation and has prior disciplinary history, the matter will be referred to OSI for resolution. The FCR grade impact recommendations will be seriously considered by OSI. If a student does NOT accept responsibility, the Faculty member should still fill out the online incident referral form and forward the case to OSI if academic misconduct is still suspected. Complete the online incident referral form Please indicate in the incident description section that a FCR was completed, including if responsibility was established and recommended sanctions.
