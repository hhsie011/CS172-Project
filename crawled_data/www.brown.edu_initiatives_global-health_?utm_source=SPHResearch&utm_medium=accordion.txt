The Consortium of Universities for Global Health (CUGH) defines global health as, "an area for study, research, and practice that places a priority on improving health and achieving equity in health for all people worldwide."1 Global health emphasizes trans-national health issues, determinants, and solutions; involves many disciplines within and beyond the health sciences and promotes interdisciplinary collaboration; is a synthesis of population-based prevention with individual-level clinical care. The interests of global health span the range from vaccine development and delivery, to economic disparity and extreme poverty, to cultural and psychosocial factors that influence etiology, prevention, surveillance and treatment of disease, etc. 1.

Mission Statement The Global Health Initiative is a multidisciplinary university-wide effort to reduce health inequalities among underserved populations locally and worldwide through education, research, service and development of partnerships. Global Health in Education, Research and Service The GHI is distinguished by an integrative, overarching approach to the fundamentally interrelated problems of health and development. One key advantage of the GHI is its ability to bring together the social, cultural, and human dimensions of global health problems and their biomedical and technological elements under a single umbrella. Building upon Brown's expertise in both population analysis and infectious disease intervention, the Initiative offers high impact education, research, and service opportunities for students and faculty, and addresses issues of capacity, infrastructure, environment, and health care delivery to reduce the burden of disease in impoverished communities.
