Support for disordered eating concerns Our Cornell Healthy Eating Program (CHEP) team is comprised of Cornell Health nutritionists, medical providers, behavioral health providers, and counselors who work together to provide integrated support for students with eating disorders or eating concerns. If you're struggling with disordered eating or an eating disorder – or if your feelings and behaviors related to body image and eating begin to impede your ability to participate in and enjoy life [see our Body Image & Disordered Eating page] – it’s important to seek help. Even occasional binging, purging, restricted eating, excessive exercise, or body obsession can negatively impact your health and your ability to study and learn. To get care, call us during business hours at 607-255-5155: You can schedule an appointment with your Primary Care Provider at Cornell Health to discuss any concerns related to your nutrition, eating, or body image. When necessary, your provider can link to with related information and support. You can also connect directly with our CHEP team members to evaluate your current health and habits, and – when appropriate – provide medical care, counseling, and ongoing support to help you optimize your health and well-being. CHEP can also connect you with support groups, and if needed, provide specialized referrals for treatment outside the scope of Cornell Health services. If you’re concerned about someone else: You can speak with a member of the CHEP team to consult about a student, and brainstorm about how to refer someone to treatment. Call us during business hours at 607-255-5155 and ask to speak with a CHEP provider. Learn more about disordered eating, and about how to help a friend. Our philosophy of care CHEP’s model of care is informed by principles originally outlined by the Health at Every Size philosophy that the best way to improve health is to honor your body. It supports people in adopting healthy habits for the sake of health and well-being. These principles include: Accepting and respecting the natural diversity of body sizes and shapes Eating in a flexible manner that values pleasure and honors internal cues of hunger, satiety, and appetite Finding the joy in moving one’s body and becoming more physically vital See also ...
