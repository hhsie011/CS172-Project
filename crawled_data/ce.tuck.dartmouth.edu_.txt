Students are encouraged to partake in any of Tuck's individual or cross-Center opportunities to truly customize their learning and experience.

In weekly sessions, teams of entrepreneurs work with each other to transform their business ideas into actual businesses. Along the way, they receive expert guidance from guest speakers who offer advice on topics such as corporate law, intellectual property, and go-to-market strategies. Students have access to a robust community of mentors and access to direct advisor support.
