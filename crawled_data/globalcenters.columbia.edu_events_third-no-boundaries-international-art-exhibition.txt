The partners invite children and teenagers between kindergarten and high school from all over the world to submit artwork that will be publicly exhibited in international traveling exhibitions in the coming year. This year’s theme is ‘One Tree, One City,’ which encourages exploration of the bond between cities, trees and nature through art. No-Boundaries is a multi-city project that aims to build an international art and educational platform by connecting young artists regardless of nationality, languages or culture. The artwork will be shown in galleries open to the public in the host cities of Beijing, Paris, Nairobi, New York and Rio de Janeiro. The exhibition will feature 150 artworks by children in grades K-12 from 15 countries, including artworks by kids from the Rio de Janeiro area and across Brazil. >> Program: 10:30 Abertura - Teresa Borges, Program Manager - Columbia Global Centers | Rio de Janeiro 10:40 Baitong Yan, Fundadora da ONG No Boundaries, apresenta Roger Melo, 11:00 Entrega de certificados aos participantes do projeto "One Tree, one City" 11:15 - 12:30 Exposição "One Tree, one City" Upcoming Events Columbia Global CentersAmman / Beijing / Istanbul / Mumbai / Nairobi / Paris / Rio / Santiago / Tunis Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
