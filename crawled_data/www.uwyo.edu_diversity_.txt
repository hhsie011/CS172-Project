This office was made possible due to the vision, commitment, and hard work of past President Laurie Nichols, the support of the Board of Trustees, the Office of the President, and members of the University of Wyoming campus community both past and present. The doors to this office opened on July 17, 2017. Dr. Emily Monago served as the inaugural Chief Diversity Officer. Message from the President and Provost on Concerns about Legislative Budget & Gender Studies Feb. 28, 2022. As many of you know, a state budget amendment was proposed late last week that would restrict our ability to teach gender studies and possibly other courses as well. We share many concerns that have been expressed to us by our faculty and staff. We disagree with the Senate position, which thankfully was adopted on the thinnest possible margin. We agree with the House that this amendment should not be considered germane to the bill, in addition to other serious concerns of both practice and principle that we have with it. We will be monitoring this closely, and as always, we are working to ensure the best outcomes for the university and state in this legislative session.
