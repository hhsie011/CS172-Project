You may be able to complete an internship as early as your first year if you are a degree seeking student enrolled on a full-time basis. If your internship opportunity does not require for you to receive school credit, see an advisor from the Toppel Career Center; he or she will be responsible in filling out the necessary paperwork for your company: https://hireacane.miami.edu/ Moreover, if your company requires you to receive school credit, see your corresponding faculty advisors or program chairs: For the Department of Cinema & Interactive Media: see Prof. J. Stern: https://com.miami.edu/cinema-interactive-media For the Department of Communication Studies: see Prof. S. Pavlow: https://com.miami.edu/communication-studies Department of Strategic Communication: For the Advertising major, see Prof. A. Lancaster. Moreover, if your major is in Public Relations, see Prof. C. Splichal, who oversees the fall and spring internships. https://com.miami.edu/strategic-communication Department of Journalism & Media Management: See Prof. B. Treadwell your internship falls during the fall or spring terms. If your internship takes place during the summer term, you will need to meet with Vice Dean P. Driscoll.http://com.miami.edu/journalism-media-management Of great importance, each aforementioned department has different policies surrounding its internship program. For instance, you will need a minimum of nine credits in communication in your academic file for the Department of Journalism and Media Management. In essence, you may be able to complete this internship as early as your 2nd semester of your freshmen year. Furthermore, the number of credits for the internship class may vary based on the amount of hours that you will work throughout the semester. For example, an approximation of 45 hours reflects a credit for the internship class. Lastly, please schedule a meeting with your corresponding faculty advisor or program chair, so you can fill out the necessary paperwork for your company as well as internship class: contract, a log of hours worked, appraisal, weekly assignments, etc. ABOUT GENERAL ABOUT THE SCHOOL FROM THE DEAN PROGRAMS FACILITIES FACILITIES RESERVATION DEANS ADVISORY COMMITTEE INTERACTIVE MEDIA CENTER MEDIA SERVICES CALENDAR TECHNOLOGY ABOUT COMPUTER LABS RECOMMENDED LAPTOPS SOFTWARE GUIDES CONTACT FACULTY BY DEPARTMENT ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF FULL DIRECTORY DIRECTIONS CENTER FOR COMMUNICATION, CULTURE & CHANGE ABOUT THE CENTER CENTER MEMBERS CENTER NEWS PILOT PROJECTS PROJECTS FUNDING APPLICATION PREVIOUS KNIGHT CHAIRS GRADUATE FELLOWSHIPS BROWN BAG SERIES ADMISSIONS UNDERGRADUATE FIRST-YEAR APPLICATION PROCESS TRANSFER APPLICATION PROCESS TRANSFER FAQS INTERNATIONAL APPLICATION PROCESS GRADUATE MA APPLICATION PROCESS MS APPLICATION PROCESS MFA APPLICATION PROCESS PHD APPLICATION PROCESS CERT APPLICATION PROCESS GRADUATE FAQS FINANCIAL TUITION FINANCIAL AID SCHOLARSHIPS PROGRAMS COMMUNICATION STUDIES DEPARTMENT OVERVIEW COMMUNICATION STUDIES, BSC COMMUNICATION STUDIES, MA CINEMATIC ARTS DEPARTMENT OVERVIEW MOTION PICTURES, BSC MOTION PICTURES, MFA DOCUMENTARY, MFA INTERACTIVE MEDIA DEPARTMENT OVERVIEW INTERACTIVE MEDIA, BSC INTERACTIVE MEDIA, MFA JOURNALISM & MEDIA MGMT DEPARTMENT OVERVIEW BROADCAST JOURNALISM, BSC ELECTRONIC MEDIA, BSC JOURNALISM, BSC MEDIA MANAGEMENT, BSC JOURNALISM, MA DOCUMENTARY, MFA MEDIA MANAGEMENT, MS MEDIA MANAGEMENT, CERT STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION DEPARTMENT OVERVIEW ADVERTISING, BSC PUBLIC RELATIONS, BSC PUBLIC RELATIONS, MA PHD PROGRAM PROGRAM OVERVIEW STUDENTS UNDERGRADUATE UNDERGRADUATE ADVISING DEGREE REQUIREMENTS MINORS NEW STUDENTS BULLETIN & FORMS HONORS PROGRAM GRADUATE GRADUATE ADVISING BULLETIN, FORMS, & GUIDES DISSERTATION DEFENSE CAREER CONNECTION ABOUT CAREER CONNECTION INTERNSHIP PROGRAM INTERNSHIP FAQS USEFUL LINKS 8-STEP JOB SEARCH TOOLKIT CAREER POSTINGS SPECIAL PROGRAMS SPECIAL TOPICS COURSES SEMESTER IN LOS ANGELES STUDY ABROAD IN AUSTRALIA STUDY ABROAD IN CANNES STUDY ABROAD IN THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS STUDY ABROAD IN INDIA STUDY ABROAD IN LONDON STUDY ABROAD IN GREECE STUDY ABOAD IN PRAGUE ORGANIZATIONS LIST OF ORGANIZATIONS STUDENT MEDIA DEAN’S STUDENT CIRCLE OUR WORK NEWS ALL NEWS STUDENT & FACULTY AWARDS ADVERTISING BROADCAST JOURNALISM COMMUNICATION STUDIES DOCTORAL ELECTRONIC MEDIA JOURNALISM MEDIA MANAGEMENT MOTION PICTURES PUBLIC RELATIONS PROJECTS & MEDIA PROJECTS ORANGE UMBRELLA COSFORD CINEMA DISTRACTION MAGAZINE IBIS YEARBOOK NORTON HERRICK CENTER THE MIAMI HURRICANE UMTV RESEARCH RESEARCH RESOURCES FUNDING APPLICATIONS RESEARCH AWARDS FACULTY MICRO-GRANTS ORA GRANT SUBMISSION RESEARCH LECTURES FRIENDS SUPPORT THE SOC BE A PART OF A LEGACY PARENT GIVING ALUMNI GIVING FUNDING PRIORITIES MAKING A DIFFERENCE NAMING OPPORTUNITIES CORPORATE AFFILIATE PROGRAM ESTATE AND GIFT PLANNING COMMUNICATION FUNDS ALUMNI ALUMNI SERVICES ALUMNI EVENTS ALUMNI SPOTLIGHTS ALUMNI ASSOCIATION IMPORTANT DATES Summer / Fall Aug 16 International Student Orientation Aug 22 Classes Begin Aug 31 Last Day for Registration and to Add a Course Sept 7 Last Day to Drop a Course Without a "W" Sept 14 Application for Graduation Opens Oct 13 - 16 Fall Recess Oct 14 Last Day to Apply for Graduation Oct 28 Last Day to Drop a Course Nov 7 Registration for Spring 2023* Begins Dec 7 Classes End Dec 8 Reading Day Dec 9 - 15 Final Exams Dec 15 Semester Ends (11:00 PM) Dec 22 Final Grades Available in CaneLink *As Scheduled By Appointment APPLY ONLINE EXPLORE THE SOC LATEST NEWS University of Miami Debate Team Wins Second ACC Championship New Class Explores Learning in the Metaverse Entertainment Law is in the Future for this Graduate #WEARESOC #Repost @univmiami with @make_repost ・・・ We Dean Wilkins cordially invites you to join our gra You’re almost there, ‘Canes!
