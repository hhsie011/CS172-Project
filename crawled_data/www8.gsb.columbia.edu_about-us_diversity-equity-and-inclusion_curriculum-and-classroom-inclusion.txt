Columbia Business School is committed to providing educational offerings that reflect the increasingly diverse experiences and perspectives in our classrooms. The DEI Initiative has partnered with the Samberg Center for Teaching Excellence and Columbia CaseWorks on audits of classroom materials, including a survey on inclusive language for all core courses. In January 2020, Columbia Business School, Mailman School of Public Health, and the School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) were the first schools at Columbia University to participate in the University Life Pronouns in Use pilot program. This program offers MBA, EMBA, MS, and PhD students the opportunity to register their gender pronouns using the NameCoach tool in Canvas. In partnership with the Dean’s Summer Programming Working Group and the Career Management Center, the DEI Initiative assisted in the launch of the Deans Summer Fellows program for Summer 2020. This program offers current students and recent graduates summer internship opportunities through CBS in light of reduced employment opportunities due to COVID-19. Through the Deans Summer Fellows: Course Development Track, 60 students and recent graduates are working with faculty and Columbia CaseWorks to increase inclusivity and representation in materials for 30 CBS courses by developing new course content and revising existing materials.
