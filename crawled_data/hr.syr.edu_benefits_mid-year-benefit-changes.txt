However, if you experience a qualified life event change, you may make changes outside of this enrollment period, within 31* days of the event. Under IRS regulations, there are certain qualified events in family or employment status that permit you to make changes to your benefits. Examples of qualifying life events include: marriage or establishment of a domestic partnership legal separation or divorce death birth or adoption of a child loss of other coverage, such as through a spouse’s employer eligibility for or loss of Medicaid or CHIP coverage In addition, the IRS allows you to change coverage mid-year if your spouse’s Open Enrollment includes new coverage options not previously available. Please notify HR Shared Services within 31* days of the event in order to make the change. Supporting documentation will be required, and if approved, the change will be effective as of the date of the qualified change in status. If you do not report this change in status within 31* days of the event, you will not be able to change your coverage until the next annual Open Enrollment period. If you have any questions on this, contact the HR Shared Services team with questions to see if a change is allowed. *You may make changes to your benefits coverage within 60 days if the event is due to eligibility for or loss of Medicaid or CHIP coverage.
