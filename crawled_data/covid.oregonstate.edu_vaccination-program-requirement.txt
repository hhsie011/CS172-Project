Employee Requirement The OSU COVID-19 Vaccination Program Requirement required that employees upload proof of vaccination to the secure portal by Jan. 4, 2022. The OSU COVID-19 Vaccination Requirement applies to all on-site university employees, full-time or part-time, including but not limited to academic faculty, professional faculty, academic wage appointments, classified staff, graduate assistants and student employees, though exceptions are allowed when based on (1) medical or disability reasons or (2) sincerely held religious beliefs. Please contact [email protected] with questions. Background On Oct. 27, 2021, OSU announced revisions to its vaccination program due to White House Executive Order 14042 on Sept. 9, 2021. The Executive Order was directed at federal contractors, including OSU, making Jan. 4, 2022, the new deadline for OSU employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Federal Executive Order 14042 requires all federal contractors and subcontractors have a vaccinated workforce to fight COVID-19, among other public health measures. The Safer Federal Workforce Task Force subsequently issued guidance to federal contractors on how to implement this expansive order. Although enforcement of the vaccine requirement aspect of the Executive Order was paused nationwide as of Dec. 7, 2021 (due to an order by a federal judge in Georgia), we anticipate OSU would still need to be ready for compliance with this existing contract term. While the Executive Order is tied up in the courts and the federal government is blocked from enforcing the contract language, OSU plans to stay the course on its current COVID-19 vaccinations policy, with the new exclusion option for remote employees. While we are trying to minimize changes to OSU policy in response to federal changes, the remote employee requirement could return if the Executive Order prevails in court. Please continue to follow public health strategies to protect yourself, your loved ones, and your community. The work you do on behalf of the students and communities we serve is important – as are you. Employee Questions Do you work outside of the State of Oregon?

Exceptions Employees (including Student Employees) If applicable, you can apply for an exception for medical reasons or due to a sincerely held religious belief. You will need to complete an exception form provided on the Student Health Services COVID-19 Immunization Requirements. Medical exceptions for employees utilize the Oregon Health Authority forms that must be signed by a medical practitioner and will be verified by OSU’s Occupational Medicine program within Student Health Services. Exception requests based on religious beliefs will be verified by the Office of Equal Opportunity and Access. If an employee fails to comply with the OSU vaccination program, Employee and Labor Relations (ELR) will work directly with the supervisor to engage in an individualized plan of progressive discipline. Students Students without university employment status may continue to claim a philosophical exception in alignment with OHA rules for students. Exclusions Employee Law Enforcement Professionals (per ORS 433.416). Remote employees whose work involves neither in-person engagement with others as part of their OSU employment nor any on-site or university-sponsored activities. Student Students without university employment status and whose courses are entirely online and involve no in-person engagement with individuals outside of their households, so long as they do not otherwise engage in any in-person university-sponsored activity. Note: If students engage in-person with individuals outside of their households as part of their coursework or university-sponsored activity, the Student Requirement applies regardless of whether OSU owns or manages the property where the in-person engagement takes place. Testing Requirement Discontinued (April 8, 2022) Per the announcement on April 8, 2022, OSU students and employees who have received an exemption from being vaccinated are no longer required to test weekly. Student Requirement Effective Sept. 15, 2021, OSU required students who work, learn or engage with others in-person as part of their academic experience to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The Vaccination Requirement Program applies to all university students unless exempted or excluded from this requirement.
