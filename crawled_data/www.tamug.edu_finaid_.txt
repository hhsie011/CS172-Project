Financial aid can be a combination of scholarships, grants, loans, and work study. Scholarships and grants are "free money" that you do not need to repay. Loans need to be paid back when you enroll less than half-time or you graduate. A part-time job can also help you pay for school and living expenses. Students at Texas A&M University received approximately $810 million in financial assistance through scholarships, grants, loans, waivers, work-study, and on-campus student employment. Approximately 72% of students received some form of financial assistance. All forms of assistance continue to grow as well as the number of students receiving aid. To apply for financial aid, please submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) at https://studentaid.gov/. Use Title IV School Code 003632, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX.
