10:30 PM Paris Come celebrate the summer with “First Light,” a richly curated selection of classics of the international silent cinema, many featuring live musical accompaniment by students of Jean-François Zygel's piano improvisation class at the Conservatoire national supérieur de musique et de danse de Paris. Too few are aware that the silent cinema was a period of almost incomparable artistic creativity; the lack of sound, rather than a hindrance, was actually a kind of inspiration for the era’s finest filmmakers, who found ingenious ways to expand the visual expressiveness of their works. Not surprisingly, the great silent filmmakers—from Méliès to Griffith, from Eisenstein to Buster Keaton—continue to influence and inform contemporary artists across the disciplines. Soviet Cinema: "Earth" (1930, Alexander Dovzhenko) The arrival of the first tractor in a farming community pits the forces of progress against those who want to resist any change. Wanting their revolution to be as complete a break with the past as possible, Soviet filmmakers created some of the silent era’s most daring and innovative works. With recorded musical accompaniment.
