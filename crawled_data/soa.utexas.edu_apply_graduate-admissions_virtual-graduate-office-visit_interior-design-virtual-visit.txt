Housed within a large and active School of Architecture, the MID provides opportunities for students to achieve a high level of excellence in the design of architectural interiors in selected areas of individual interest. The program is among the handful of Interior Design faculties in the United States housed within a School of Architecture creating a dynamic atmosphere shared across a number of related graduate programs. With a faculty of four full-time Interior Design professors along with full-time and affiliated faculty in the School of Architecture, the program offers both broad coverage and an individualized program tailored to student interests. The program is founded on rigorous instruction, while offering students flexibility to develop their own ideas and new perspectives that arise from theoretical methodologies and interdisciplinary approaches. The study of Interior Design at the graduate level is taught with constant awareness of global context, interdisciplinary challenges, and evolving demands that students experience in professional practice.
