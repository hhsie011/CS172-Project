Further, we believe that the activities associated with the college experience, especially those that help emerging adults gain the cognitive and social skills necessary to be successful outside of college, should be rooted in a common set of definitions and goals. In the Division of Student Affairs, we call these definitions and goals the Co-Curricular Learning Domains, or CCLDs. The five Co-Curricular Learning Domains, definitions, and related dimensions provide both a framework and a language for describing/defining the learning that occurs through the co-curricular programs and services offered in the Division of Student Affairs. The CCLDs also reflect the values espoused by the division and the current Iowa State University Strategic Plan. Download the CCLD one-pager, or the CCLD two-pager including definitions for the dimensions.
