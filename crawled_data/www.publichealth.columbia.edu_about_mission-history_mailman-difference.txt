The Mailman Difference Public Health Oath FORWARD Accreditation The Mailman Difference Public Health Oath FORWARD Accreditation The Mailman Difference youtubeembedcode.com/de/ Around the world, increasingly complex challenges affect the health of current and future generations, including the climate crisis, humanitarian emergencies, urbanization, aging populations, and increasing health inequities. Public health professionals work to protect and improve the health of people everywhere by advancing new knowledge, informing and influencing public policy, developing and implementing solutions, and promoting healthy behaviors. Since our School’s founding in 1922, we have educated generations of public health leaders, advanced groundbreaking discovery, and delivered innovative solutions to protect and improve the health of people everywhere. We weave together education, science, and social justice to address health disparities and advance health equity around the world. Our world-class educational programs integrate an innovative skills-based curriculum, research collaborations, and hands-on field experience to prepare students for leadership roles in a range of industries and sectors, in professional practice, or research and academia. Campus activities and events, support services, and a nurturing environment help students flourish and excel. Our stellar faculty work across disciplines – biology, sociology, statistics, history, policy, and many more – to take public health from theory to practice through innovative research and programs around the globe. With a creative, entrepreneurial, and ambitious spirit, we advance discovery and solutions to tackle the biggest health challenges of the 21st century. Our research portfolio is among the largest at schools of public health and we are home to dozens of research programs and labs, including ICAP, the Center for Infection and Immunity, and the Robert N. Butler Columbia Aging Center. Dynamic, diverse New York City and world-renowned Columbia University provide boundless opportunities for personal and professional growth. We work with diverse populations throughout the City’s five boroughs and in our local Washington Heights neighborhood on complex health issues, including HIV/AIDS education, prevention, and care; smoking cessation initiatives; and programs to stem the growing asthma epidemic in our urban environment. The most important difference? Our community. Inclusive, collaborative, diverse, our culture is essential to our work, to our students’ experience and to where they go from here.
