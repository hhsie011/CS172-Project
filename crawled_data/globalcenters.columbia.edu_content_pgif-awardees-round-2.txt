The purpose of the Fund is to support faculty who are developing projects that increase opportunities for research, teaching, and service around the world. The 13 projects receiving grants were selected from 53 proposals by a review committee of senior faculty. The proposals came from 14 of Columbia’s Schools and from 14 departments in the Arts and Sciences. Many of the selected projects are led by a faculty team, and others are the work of a single Columbia faculty member. All make use of our network of eight Columbia Global Centers on four continents, and all will provide opportunities for faculty and students to address vital global issues. This year’s selected projects cover a variety of disciplines and topics, from astrophysics to sustainable agriculture to international law. The full list of funded projects can be found below. These awards follow an initial round of grants from the President’s Global Innovation Fund that last year supported 20 equally diverse projects. Collectively, these and future projects will play an essential role in realizing the potential of the Columbia Global Centers to create new opportunities for faculty and students, and in defining in tangible ways what it means for Columbia, the most global of universities, to explore new frontiers of knowledge in the 21st century.
