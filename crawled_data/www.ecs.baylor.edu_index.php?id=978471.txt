Below is the policy from the Undergraduate Catalog, effective for students entering Summer 2020 and later. Students entering Baylor prior to Summer 2020 will not have a "W" notation counted as an attempt but are still subject to all other aspects of the policy. ECS Course Repetition Students taking a course in the School of Engineering & Computer Science will have a maximum of two attempts at any one course to reach a sufficient grade in order to fulfill a prerequisite or requirement for a degree, major, or minor. An earned grade or a “W” notation counts as an attempt. Additional attempts will not be granted except by permission from the student’s Dean (or his/her representative).
