If you do not name the UW as a recipient when you take your exam, contact the IB Organization to request that an official IB transcript be sent directly to the UW Office of Admissions. When you enroll at the UW, you may be eligible for UW course credit; if so, the courses and credits awarded will be accessible to you via MyUW. IB Policy overview (beginning autumn quarter 2019) The UW recognizes the IB curriculum as a challenging academic program that provides excellent preparation for university study. In most cases, credits are awarded for subjects in which the student has earned a grade of 4 or higher. Consult the table below for specific information about credit awards in particular subjects. Additionally, students who earn an IB diploma (not a certificate) will be awarded 5 more quarter credits toward UW graduation requirements. A maximum of 45 quarter credits may be awarded for IB. Students who complete two exams with duplicate or overlapping content (e.g. AP and IB), or who complete an exam and a college course with duplicate or overlapping content will be awarded credit for only one exam or course. For students who entered prior to Autumn 2019 see the previous IB exam credit award schedule NOTE: Students who first entered the UW beginning autumn quarter 2018 should contact the Office of Admissions if they wish to have their IB credit awards re-reviewed based on the 2019 policy. Applicability toward UW graduation requirements The following abbreviations show which graduation requirements apply to the course assignments indicated for each subject exam in the table below.
