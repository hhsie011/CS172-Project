Industry Sponsored Research Brown Technology Innovations assists researchers in securing financial support from industry by identifying prospective sponsors and negotiating agreements. Sponsored research agreements generally provide sponsors with certain rights to resulting inventions and to review research results within the project scope and term. Each industry-sponsored project is led by a principal investigator who drives the research and is responsible for the scientific coordination with the sponsoring company. Each agreement is tailored to meet the specific needs of the research program it supports, but certain features common to all such agreements insure that the mission-directed goals of Brown, the academic freedom of its faculty, students and other researchers and the commercial goals of the for-profit sponsor are respected and fairly balanced.
