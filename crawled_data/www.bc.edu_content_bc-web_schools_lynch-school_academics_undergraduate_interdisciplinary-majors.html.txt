These second majors are available to undergraduate students in the Lynch School pursuing majors in Elementary Education, Applied Psychology and Human Development, and Transformative Educational Studies. American Heritages Mathematics/Computer Science Perspectives on Spanish America AMERICAN HERITAGES This major was designed for students in the Lynch School of Education and Human Development who are pursuing Elementary Education or Applied Psychology & Human Development. This major fulfills the arts and sciences program requirements for students in teacher certification programs. The major is recommended for students who are interested in the American Heritage from the literary, social, and historical perspectives. Two tracks are available for students pursuing this major: a cultural track with emphasis in the literary perspective, and a social science track for students interested in historical and sociological perspectives on our American heritage. Program of Study MATHEMATICS/COMPUTER SCIENCE The Mathematics/Computer Science Interdisciplinary Major (9 courses) is available as a second major to students in the Lynch School of Education and Human Development who are pursuing Elementary Education or Human Development. This major fulfills the arts and sciences program requirements for students pursuing teacher certification. This interdisciplinary major is not an option for students majoring in Secondary Education. The major is recommended for students who may have had four years of high school mathematics and wish to specialize in the area of mathematics and computer science, but who are not interested in the traditional mathematics major because of their intended career objective as elementary, early childhood educators. Program of Study PERSPECTIVES ON SPANISH AMERICA The Perspectives on Spanish America Interdisciplinary Major (9 courses) is available as a second major to students in the School of Education pursuing Elementary Education programs in fulfillment of their College of Arts and Sciences major for certification requirements. Secondary students cannot pursue this major and be certified. The major is recommended for students who may have had at least two years of high school Spanish and wish to develop Spanish language skills, coupled with a background in the historical, sociological, and literary traditions of Spanish American cultures. This major is particularly appropriate for students with an intended career objective to teach children of Hispanic origin. Program of Study Quick Links Facts & Figures Faculty Why LSEHD?
