Emily and Rachel have provided health education and developed a skills boot camp to prepare the HRT students for their certification exam. Penn Nursing undergraduate and graduate students were recruited to staff various boot camp skill stations that included obtaining blood pressure, measuring height and weight, hand washing, transferring patients, and donning personal protective equipment (PPE). The boot camp was evaluated very highly by the HRT students and their teachers. Kudos to Rachel, Emily and the multiple Penn Nursing volunteers! Claire M.
