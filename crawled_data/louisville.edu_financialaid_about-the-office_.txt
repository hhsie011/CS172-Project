Important message for students with a FAFSA selected for verification: Per announcements from the U.S. Department of Education's office of Federal Student Aid on July 13, 2021, and May 18, 2022, some students initially selected for the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 verification process are no longer required to complete verification. Some students still have to resolve conflicting FAFSA information and/or complete the verification process before federal aid eligibility can be evaluated or disbursed, and our office will follow up with those students as needed. Students are encouraged to monitor their university email for communications from the Student Financial Aid Office and check for outstanding tasks in the ULink portal. Click here to access the official announcement from the U.S. Department of Education. Complete the FAFSA What Year FAFSA and When?

Step-by-step FAFSA guidance is available myStudentAid App The Department of Education has launched a new mobile app called myStudentAid. The app allows students or parents to securely fill out and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) entirely from their mobile device. Previously, the FAFSA.gov website had limitation when being accessed from a mobile device and the full function of the site could only be utilized from a desktop computer. So the Department of Education Federal Student Aid office developed the app to provide mobile options to access financial aid. In addition to submitting a new FAFSA, students can also: Correct a previously filed FAFSA Renew an old FAFSA application Edit or manage an FSA ID Check federal loan and financial aid history The myStudentAid Mobile App is available in the Apple App Store and Google Play for Android.

As part of the SNAP application process, students may be asked to provide verification of Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) data, including aid awarded and/or the calculated EFC from the FAFSA. For verification of EFC: students may use a one-time email, if received, that was generated by the Department of Education in early April specifically for SNAP certification purposes*; or, use the Student Aid Report (SAR) received from the Department of Education upon completion of the FAFSA; or print the ‘College Financial Plan’ page accessible as a menu item within the ‘Financial Aid’ tile in ULink, if available (when a menu link is not present, this option is not applicable). For verification of awards: print the latest award notification received from the Student Financial Aid Office for the applicable aid year; or, print the ‘Summary’ or ‘Award Summary’ page accessible via the ‘Financial Aid’ tile in ULink. The Student Financial Aid Office is available at finaid@louisville.edu or (502) 852-5511 to assist students in need of guidance regarding access to financial aid documentation.

If it is determined you are enrolled in a course(s) that does not meet your degree requirements, your aid will be reviewed and any necessary adjustments will be made. You will be responsible for settling any potential outstanding balance created.
