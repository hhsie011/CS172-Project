The format of examinations in the major and minor concentrations is determined in consultation with each member of the Special Committee. Individual exams are followed by an oral exam with all members of the committee. Research and study opportunities: The Fine Arts Library in Sibley Hall has extensive holdings in art and architectural history; Olin and Kroch Libraries have excellent resources in history, literature, and other related fields. Particularly notable are the special collections on Dante, Petrarch, witchcraft, the history of science, East Asia, and Southeast Asia. The Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art is particularly strong in modern and Asian art. It also has a study collection in other fields, including a rich print collection. A study gallery and classroom in the museum make it a regular part of instruction. The Department of History of Art has a collection of over 300,000 slides and a study collection of photographs of works of art. The field sponsors a colloquium including graduate students in the field. Students are also encouraged to participate in one of many interdisciplinary groups in theory, medieval studies, the Renaissance colloquium, the Southeast Asia program, and others. Students interested in the history of architecture and urban development may want to consider the Field of Architecture.

The GayogoÌ±hÃ³êž‰nÇ«' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of GayogoÌ±hÃ³êž‰nÇ«' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of GayogoÌ±hÃ³êž‰nÇ«' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional GayogoÌ±hÃ³êž‰nÇ«' leadership.
