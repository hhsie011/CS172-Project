Cornell University is committed to providing an environment in which all people have an equal opportunity to participate in the university's programs, activities and services. Social media administrators have an important responsibility to make sure their account's content is accessible. Any video you natively post to your social media platforms must be closed-captioned with the proper SubRip Subtitle (srt) file. In addition, social media platforms allow administrators to craft alt text descriptions when uploading images. For additional questions, refer to Policy 5.12 or contact Web Accessibility Assistance at web-accessibility@cornell.edu. Copyright Adhere to the university's copyright policy. Using copyrighted music, photography or video footage without a license or permission exposes Cornell University – and your department or unit – to financial liability for copyright infringement. Per Policy 4.15, communication professionals are responsible for ensuring that all content on their platforms is copyright compliant. The use of copyrighted material in multimedia created by colleges, departments or student groups for informational or promotional purposes generally requires appropriate permission and often the payment of fees for at least one, and typically two, separate licenses. This includes, but is not limited to, any music, audio, video, photo, illustration, graphic, gif and other files used in multimedia production. Identifying the source of such files may also be required. In addition, administrators of university social media accounts must adhere to the terms and conditions of the social media platform. University Counsel recommends only using digital media that is in the public domain, has been purchased for use with the appropriate licenses or was originally created by Cornell University. Helpful resources and other information can be found on the Cornell Brand website or the Cornell University Library Copyright Information Center.
