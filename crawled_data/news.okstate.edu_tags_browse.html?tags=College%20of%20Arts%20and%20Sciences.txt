Nolan Malloy first stepped onto Oklahoma State University’s campus as a freshman, he never imagined he would use his geography degree to join the military.

Malloy is an Air Force pilot stationed at Vance Air Force Base in Enid, Oklahoma, while he finishes his flight training, and he is thankful to OSU for helping him get there.
