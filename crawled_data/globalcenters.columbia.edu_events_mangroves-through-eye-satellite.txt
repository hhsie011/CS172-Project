Despite their undeniable benefits, these forests are under increasing pressure due to a combination of human-induced and environmental stresses. To protect and efficiently manage the mangrove ecosystem, it is important to know where and how these forests are being depleted. Satellite remote sensing enables us to travel back in time, and to build a long-term record of mangrove forest extents and health anywhere in the world. Dr. Pinki Mondal, Senior Research Associate at the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), Earth Institute, Columbia University will discuss how she has been using satellite images from the past 27 years to understand changes in mangroves along the coast of Sierra Leone in west Africa. She will then discuss how these geospatial techniques can be used to estimate current mangrove extents in India. May 8, 2017 | 6 p.m. Venue: Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai 12, Maker Chambers VI, 1st Floor, Jamnalal Bajaj Road, Nariman Point | Mumbai RSVP: Please send a confirmation to [email protected] Dr. Pinki Mondal is an environmental geographer specializing in remote sensing and Geographic Information Sciences (GIS). She is currently a Senior Research Associate at the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), a center within the Earth Institute, Columbia University. Her current research examines impacts of weather variability on agriculture and food/nutrition security in India, and on different ecosystems across the world. She uses remote sensing/ GIS, statistics, and process-based dynamic models to quantify historical changes in landscapes, and to identify how crop productivity will vary with different adaptation strategies for projected climate change scenarios. Dr. Mondal earned her PhD in Land Change Science from the University of Florida, USA.
