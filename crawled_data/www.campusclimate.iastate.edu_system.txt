The team meets quarterly to discuss the broader campus climate and is able to communicate in real-time as necessary. Along with determining the appropriate outreach and action steps needed to take after an incident occurs on campus, the team also notifies the community when appropriate. Aid to those who have been affected is offered through outreaches conducted by members of the CCRS. You are welcome to contact members of the team if you feel that you have been the target of a bias incident, harassment, hate crime, or discrimination. Or, if you prefer, incidents can be reported directly via the Incident Reporting Form. Additional resources and an FAQ are available. Have you experienced a campus climate incident that has impacted you, and you need assistance in connecting with available resources and services? Do you have concerns about a campus climate incident, but you are not sure what to do? If so, please contact the Campus Climate ReportingTeam by submitting your concerns using the online Campus Climate Incident Reporting Form. If you prefer not to report the incident via the online form, other options are available during regular business hours (8 a.m.-5 p.m., Monday-Friday). Iowa State University students, faculty, staff and campus visitors are encouraged to contact Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at 515-294-8840 or vpdeioffice@iastate.edu to report an incident and/or schedule an appointment with a staff member. Reports will be acknowledged within three business days. Anyone encountering a situation that requires immediate police assistance, medical or other emergency services should call the Iowa State University Police Department (ISUPD) at 515-294-4428 or 911.
