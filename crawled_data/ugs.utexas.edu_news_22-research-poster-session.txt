Students presented more than 180 research posters on interdisciplinary topics ranging from art education to electrophysiology to history. This year’s event marked a return to an in-person poster session, where students presented large-format posters of their research to attendees. The top presenters were selected for $2,000, $1,000, and $500 awards. Judges also selected the recipient of a $500 award for poster design, and event attendees voted for a $1,000 audience choice award. Each academic college participating in the event nominated students as finalists for poster presentation awards. Students were judged on their statements of their research problems and methodology, their results and conclusions, and the poster design and oral discussion. Thanks to a gift from Kimberly and Scott Martin, this year’s Longhorn Research Poster Session offered awards for students presenting research posters. The event was part of Research Week 2022, the university-wide celebration of student research and creative activity. Other Research Week events included panel discussions, art exhibitions, and other poster sessions across campus.
