Students majoring in advertising find career opportunities in professions requiring applied communication expertise. Graduates are qualified for positions in the creative and account sides of advertising within businesses, agencies and media. Coursework in this major focuses on writing, research, digital and emerging media, and professional abilities. Students are required to complete a capstone internship experience to practice and refine their skills. The Greenlee School of Journalism and Communication prepares students for the field of communication. The school offers three majors: Advertising Bachelor of Arts (ADVRT) Journalism and Mass Communication Bachelor of Science (JL MC) Public Relations Bachelor of Science (P R) In addition, the Greenlee School offers a 4+1 program allowing students to complete their B.A. or B.S. and earn an M.S. in journalism and mass communication in fewer semesters. Professional skills are taught and practiced alongside academic requirements using the latest technology and leading-edge communication trends and methods. Founded in 1905, the unit was one of the first journalism programs to be accredited in 1948 and continues to be one of the longest continuously accredited programs in the country. Accreditation is based on the principle that students need a broad-based, liberal arts education and solid core courses within the discipline. Students taking one major at the school may not seek a second major or minor in the school. All students are required to take a second major or minor outside the school as an area of expertise.
