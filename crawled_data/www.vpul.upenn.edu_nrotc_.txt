With over sixty five years of experience, the Penn Naval ROTC program seeks to train the most technically and tactically proficient officers to serve in the United States Navy and Marine Corps. Through hard work, perseverance, and the help of our highly trained officers, one can earn a commission into the world’s strongest navy. Our Mission To develop midshipmen morally, mentally and physically and to imbue them with the highest ideals of duty, honor and loyalty in order to commission college graduates as officers. They must possess a basic professional background, be motivated towards a career in the Naval Service and have a potential for future development in mind and character so as to assume the highest responsibilities of command, citizenship and government. Statement on COVID-19 PENN NROTC remains committed to the development of exceptional Naval Officers and to the health and safety of all of its Midshipmen, staff, and the Philadelphia community at large. As the world continues to grapple with issues of unprecedented scale and human impact, our organization embraces these challenges head on and adapts to overcome them. As we continue to execute the NROTC mission and commission future Naval and Marine Corps leaders, we must prioritize the safety and health of all NROTC personnel. To ensure the safety of all students and staff, the University of Pennsylvania NROTC program will transition to a fully virtual curriculum. The benefits of conducting in-person training are outweighed by the risks to personnel health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. All training evolutions will be conducted in a virtual environment and the Hollenback center will be closed in the Fall 2020. See the Midshipmen FAQs section for more information.
