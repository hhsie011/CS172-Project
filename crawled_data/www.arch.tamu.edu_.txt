Architecture is an excellent combination of math and art.” Jun Lee / ‘24 “I chose Texas A&M because of the Aggie Network. A friend who is an alumnus told me great things about the program. That's what drew me here.” Chukwudi (Chudi) Nwokoma / ‘23 “This degree prepares me for licensure and propels me into this challenging field. I believe architecture can drive social change.” Katharine Koehler / ‘23 “Plants have always been a hobby— growing and learning about them. After discovering landscape architecture, it piqued my interest.” Lauren Kasel / ‘25 “I chose the College of Architecture because it blends well with my future career. It's a supportive learning environment, thanks to helpful faculty and staff.” Lillian Vukin / ‘22 “My sister was an Aggie, so I'd visited campus a lot. I really liked the vibe; the energy people have, and things like Fish Camp helped me fit in!” Philips Fafiyebi / ‘23 “I'm really enjoying the construction science program. After shadowing architecture firms and looking at engineering, I realized construction science would be a great fit for me.” PJ Kiburz / ‘24 Next Testimonial Inspiring Moments Stretch yourself with a semester away studying abroad or working at an internship.
