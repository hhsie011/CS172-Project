Multicultural Affairs recognizes that identity, social responsibility, allyship and equity must be addressed at multiple interconnected levels to best support students' various developmental stages. Each student brings to campus many cultures, experiences and perspectives, and Multicultural Affairs serves as a resource for them to capitalize on the rich education and growth found in the active exchange across multiple identities within a community. Our advisors provide programs, resources and support for personal identity development, mentorship, intercultural learning, social justice education and institutional advocacy. Through strong collaborations with students, within Undergraduate Student Life and across the University, Multicultural Affairs’ three-tiered approach supports internal and external partnerships and shared accountability.
