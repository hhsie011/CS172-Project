Dr. Mor was on the faculty of the Department of Community Health since 1981 until it became the Department of Health Services, Policy and Practice. He was tenured in 1987 and promoted to Professor in 1990. Dr. Mor was one of the founders of the Department's graduate program in 1986 and directed the Center for Gerontology and Health Care Research for 10 years. He served as Chair of the Department of Community Health from 1996 until 2010. Dr. Mor has been Principal Investigator of over 40+ NIH funded grants focusing on the use of health services and the outcomes frail and chronically ill persons experience. He was recipient of a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation health policy investigator award and a MERIT award from the National Institute on Aging and has evaluated the impact of programs and policies in aging and long term care including Medicare funding of hospice, changes in Medicare nursing home payment and the introduction of quality measures. He was one of the authors of the Congressionally mandated Minimum Data Set (MDS) for Nursing Home Resident Assessment and the architect of an integrated Medicare claims and clinical assessment data used for policy analysis, pharmaco-epidemiology and population outcome measurement. Dr. Mor has developed several summary measures based upon MDS data to characterize residents' physical, cognitive and psycho-social functioning, all of which have been used in resident and facility level analyses of the quality of nursing home care in US and international populations. Dr. Mor was part of a team of researchers that developed and validate risk adjusted quality indicators for nursing homes, versions of which are currently being used in public reporting throughout the country. This data resource is at the heart of the NIA funded Program Project Grant, "Changing Long Term Care in America" which examines the impact of Medicaid and Medicare policies on long term care providers and the patients they serve. This integrated data structure is also at the core of a series of large, pragmatic cluster randomized trials of novel nursing home based interventions. Dr. Mor was elected to the National Academy of Medicine in 2015. In 2011, Dr. Mor was given the Distinguished Investigator Award From AcademyHealth, the premier health services research organization in the country and in 2013, was given the John Eisenberg Excellence in Mentoring Award from the Agency for Health Research and Quality, as well as the Distinguished Researcher Award from the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization. In 2018, Dr. Mor was given the Esther and Isadore Kesten Memorial Lectureship Award at University of Southern California, Leonard Davis School of Gerontology and the Andrus Research Center. Dr. Mor has been an active VA HSR&D investigator for the past decade and helped establish the Providence VAMC Center of Innovation (COIN) where he is now directing a number of independent investigator initiated research projects focused on the VA Geriatrics and Extended Care service. Dr. Mor was a member of the Secretary of HHS's National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics and the recently completed Institute of Medicine Committee on Long Term Care Quality. He served on the Board of AcademyHealth, the premier health services research association in the US and chairs the Independent Quality Committee for hcr-Manorcare, a US nursing home group. He has published over 400 peer reviewed articles and numerous books and book chapters on hospice, physical functioning, long term care and cancer treatment patterns among the elderly as well as the organization of AIDS health services. He is on several editorial boards including Health Services Research. He held a MERIT award from NIA for his research on organizational factors related to nursing home quality and residents' outcomes for 10 years and was a recipient of a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health Policy Investigator award to examine the influence of managed care and integrated delivery systems on the strategic decisions of nursing homes and their quality consequences for residents. He examined the effect of state policies on the quality of care provided nursing home residents, including hospitalization, merging primary and secondary data from all nursing facilities throughout the United States. Dr. Mor is now funded by the NIA to undertake a large Program Project Grant, "Changing Long Term Care in America: Policies, Markets, Strategies, and Outcomes". This program involves 3 research and administration cores and 4 separate projects all of which seek to better understand the impact of changing state Medicaid policies on long term care providers and the patients that they serve. Collaborating with colleagues from Harvard, Dartmouth and the University of Chicago, Dr. Mor and his Brown colleagues have documented large regional variation in hospitalization rates, including end of life transitions and the use of hospice and palliative care. Additionally, this research has documented substantial disparities in the care and outcomes white and minority nursing home residents receive, largely attributable to the fact that Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to reside in sub-standard facilities.

Full Text PubMed Research Research Overview Dr. Mor's research focuses on the organizational and health care delivery system factors associated with variation in use of health services, and outcomes experienced by frail and chronically ill persons. Areas of study include: the quality of nursing home care, Medicare funding for post-acute care, the determinants of hospitalization, disease management for cancer patients and age and racial discrimination in health care treatments. Research Statement Dr. Mor has been Principal Investigator of over 40+ NIH funded grants focusing on the organizational and health care delivery system factors associated with variation in use of health services and the outcomes frail and chronically ill persons experience. He has had multiple grants from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the Commonwealth Fund, Pew Memorial Trust, the Retirement Research Foundation and the Commonwealth Fund, as well as contracts from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation to evaluate the impact of programs and policies in aging and long term care including Medicare funding of hospice, the costs and benefits of day hospital treatment of cancer, patient outcomes in nursing homes, the impact of short term case management for cancer patients, several studies documenting age discrimination in cancer treatment and use of home care services, and a national study of residential care facilities. Over the past 30 years Dr. Mor's research has frequently integrated quantitative and qualitative data, particularly in program evaluations examining the approaches communities, organizations, and specific providers use to adjust to health policy changes, such as financing and reimbursement, or to the emergence of integrated delivery systems. Dr. Mor was one of the authors of the Congressionally mandated Minimum Data Set (MDS) for Nursing Home Resident Assessment and evaluated its implementation. Dr. Mor has conducted extensive research on the reliability and validity of the MDS data as used in the field and has pioneered the use of these data to characterize nursing home residents' physical, cognitive, and psycho-social functioning, all of which have been used in resident and facility level analyses of the quality of nursing home care in US and international populations. Dr. Mor directed the Brown University component of a CMS contract to develop and validate risk adjusted quality indicators for nursing homes that are now being used for public reporting of nursing home quality throughout the country. He recently completed the second 5 years of a MERIT award from NIA for his research on nursing home organizational factors related to facility quality and residents' outcomes and has subsequently received multiple NIA grants to examine the policy and organizational determinants of hospitalization of nursing home residents and other indicators of the quality of care provided. Dr. Mor was the recipient of a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health Policy Investigator award to examine the influence of managed care and integrated delivery systems on the strategic decisions of nursing homes and their quality consequences for residents. Presently, he is examining the effect of state policies and market factors on the quality of care provided nursing home residents, including rehospitalization, merging primary and secondary data from all nursing facilities in the United States. Dr. Mor is seeking to determine whether quality is worse in the states with consistently poor and disjointed long term care policies. Dr. Mor was a member of the Secretary of HHS's National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics and the Institute of Medicine Committee on Long Term Care Quality. He is a member of the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Health Services Research for the Department of Veteran Affairs. He was Chair of the Long Term Care Interest group of AcademyHealth, seeking to expand that organization's interest in and fostering of research on long term care and is currently Program Chair for the Annual Research Meeting of AcademyHealth in Washington, DC in 2008. He has published over 400 peer reviewed articles and numerous books and book chapters on nursing home quality, hospice, physical functioning, long term care, and cancer treatment patterns among the elderly as well as the organization of AIDS health services. Dr. Mor has published widely on the measurement of quality of life and physical functioning in various chronically ill populations using both previously standardized as well as novel measures of functioning. He has published models pertaining to the measurement of quality in long term care facilities and lectures widely on this topic. He is a fellow of the American Gerontological Society and is on the editorial board of Health Services Research. Funded Research 2018-2020 Co-Investigator.

The overarching goal is to examine PAC utilization and patient outcomes across different conditions and PAC settings to address important gaps in knowledge that hinder the design of current policy efforts undertaken under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) like episode-based bundling of payments and the creation of Accountable Care Organizations, aimed at improving the value of post-acute care. 2018-2019 Co-Investigator. NIA 3R01AG054656-02S1 Administrative Supplement (PI: Gozalo) Which Post-Acute Care Setting is Best for Patients' Outcomes? Post-acute care is widely used and costly. While patients have options for PAC services between different post-acute settings, there is little information on how these alternative post-acute care settings impact outcomes for different patient groups. ADRD patients are a particularly vulnerable group with different PAC needs and at higher risk of long-term institutionalization. The results of our study will help inform the referral of patients in need of PAC, and help guide policy aimed at improving PAC patient outcomes. 2018-2019 Mentor. AHRQ 1R36HS026447-01(PI: Kosar) Financial Desirability of Nursing Home Patients: Do Low Levels of Medicare Reimbursement Limit Access to High-Quality Post-Acute Care and Impact Outcomes? The objective of this study is to examine whether current Medicare payment policies, which distinguish patients going to nursing homes (NHs) based on the amount of Skilled Nursing Facilty (SNF) revenue they are expected to generate, create barriers to admission to high quality NHs for post-acute patients. Based on recent qualitative evidence showing that high-quality NHs increasingly solicit referrals for the most lucrative post-acute care patients, this study uses a novel strategy to emulate the process of screening patients according to the level of anticipated SNF reimbursement. 2018-2019 Mentor.

PHP241E examines Medicare Policy changes while offering students the opportunity to work with real Medicare data to test health services questions ranging from the causes of geographic variation in care patterns to whether the "volume-outcome" relationship is generally true. PHP2019 focuses on approaches to measuring the quality of health care from basic measurement principles to performance measurement and the benefits and potential adverse effects of creating and using composite quality measures.
