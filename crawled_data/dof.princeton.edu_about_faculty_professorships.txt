Income from the fund is expended by a committee comprised of the presidents of the four universities, together with the president of the United States Trust Company, which administers the trust. The income is devoted to "education in natural and physical sciences" and the "general advancement of science by investigation, research, and experimentation" in the four universities. In conformity with the objectives of the trust, Princeton University has established Eugene Higgins Professorships in the sciences, supported by income received from the fund. 1949 - 1978 M. G.
