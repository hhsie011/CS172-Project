Starting in the fall of 2019, the Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine will begin a multi-floor renovation requiring the deinstallation of the Center for the History of Medicine’s Warren Anatomical Museum Gallery on the Library's fifth floor. All of the artwork, artifacts, and specimens in the building were taken down for their protection during construction. Plans are now underway to design and imagine the gallery for its re-installation, and while delayed during the evolving pandemic, the museum is looking to reopen the gallery to the public sometime in 2022. The Warren Anatomical Museum will continue to offer educational sessions to the Harvard community throughout the renovation and host a number of open houses during the fall and spring academic semesters. Please visit our event calendar for these limited-attendance programs. Also look for new content about museum holdings on our new Museum landing page.
