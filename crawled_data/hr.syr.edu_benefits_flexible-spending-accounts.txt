If you had an FSA in either year, the options are detailed below. Syracuse University offers eligible employees the opportunity to contribute pre-tax dollars to Health Care and Dependent Care FSAs administered by HealthEquity/WageWorks. The Health Care FSA can be used to pay for eligible health care expenses such as copays, deductibles, prescription drugs and over-the-counter medications, dental exams and treatment, eyeglasses and contact lenses. If you elect a Health Care FSA, you can spend the funds on expenses for yourself, your spouse and your children, or other individuals that you claim as dependents on your tax return. Neither you nor your family members need to be enrolled in the Syracuse University health plan, or even enrolled in the same health plan. The Dependent Care FSA can be used to pay for daycare and related expenses for a dependent child or adult so that you and your spouse/domestic partner can work or attend school. Maximum Contribution In 2022, the maximum amount you can contribute is $2,850 to a Health Care FSA and $5,000 per household to a Dependent Care FSA. Carryover of Unused Funds All unused funds from both 2020 and 2021 will carry over and be available for use in the next year. This opportunity is provided under temporary COVID relief legislation that the University has adopted. However, for 2022, the amount you will be eligible to carry over to 2023 will reduce to $570. Filing a Claim The deadline to submit claims for expenses incurred during the plan year, which runs from Jan. 1 (or your enrollment date, if later) through Dec. 31, is normally Apr. 30 of the following plan year. However, due to the COVID-19 national health emergency, certain regulations regarding plan administration deadlines have been suspended to give participants more time to file claims for benefits under a Health Care FSA. It is important to note that this does not apply to 2022. The Dependent Care FSA is still subject to the Apr. 30 claim filing deadline. If you have questions about the deadline for submitting Health Care FSA claims, please contact HealthEquity/WageWorks at 877.924.3967 (TTY: 866.353.8058). For 2020 and 2021, if you end your participation in a Health Care FSA mid-year, reimbursements will be allowed for eligible health care expenses incurred through the end of the calendar year in which your participation ended and reimbursements will be limited to only unused contributions. As a reminder, this is already allowed for Dependent Care FSAs. Changing Your Election Typically, you can make your elections when you first become benefits-eligible, during a qualified family status change, or during Open Enrollment each year. If you are eligible to reduce your Health Care FSA contribution, the reduced contribution must be no less than the claims that have already been reimbursed or approved for reimbursement. Contact HealthEquity/WageWorks at 877.924.3967 (TTY: 866.353.8058) or HR Shared Services at 315.443.4042 should you have any questions on these benefits or the COVID-19 relief legislation and how it may apply to you.
