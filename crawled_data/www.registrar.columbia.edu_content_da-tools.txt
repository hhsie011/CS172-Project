Given the highly sensitive nature of information in our systems, we maintain a commitment to full compliance with FERPA regulations and to stay current with best practices in student information management. The Office of the University Registrar reviews all access requests to university systems containing student records. Before accessing student records, faculty and staff are expected to review FERPA guidelines at: Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Faculty and staff who have access to student records should complete the Security Awareness Training, of which FERPA is a part, here: http://cuit.columbia.edu/cuit/security-awareness-training (link is external) The Office of the University Registrar is available to assist departments and offices with understanding the requirements of FERPA policy and guidelines. Training may be requested at: mailto:[email protected]. Administrators who need access to departmental class lists, class rosters or student data may apply for administrative access to Student Services Online (SSOL). In addition to authorization, administrators must also have a valid University Network ID (UNI) and password (usually the same as the email ID and password) to access SSOL.
