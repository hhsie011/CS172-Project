This year our group will be hosted by our very own Peter Svarre and feature a talk with journalist, Lone Kühlmann and Mette Nøhr Claushøj. We are happy to announce that Lone Kühlmann, the iconic journalist, commentator, author and public speaker will be our guest of honor at this year’s Thanksgiving Dinner, in a talk with Mette Nøhr Claushøj. In this talk, Lone Kühlmann will reflect on the time of huge change in society, in race and women’s rights, that met her when she arrived in New York, and she will talk about the influence that year at Columbia has had on her professional life. Mette Nøhr Claushøj will interview Lone Kühlmann. Born in 1975, Mette is an accomplished journalist herself, an expert, commentator and public speaker on American politics. She is a graduate of SIPA, Columbia School of International and Public Affairs.
