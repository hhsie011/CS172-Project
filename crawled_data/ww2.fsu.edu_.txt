Our semi-annual lecture program has brought leading scholars to campus for speaking engagements since 2012. Additionally, we have sponsored two international academic conferences in Tallahassee, one focusing on the Global History of Religion in the Second World War and the other examining Comparative Home Fronts. Other initiatives have led to an exhibit, “Witness to War” at the John & Mable Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota, Florida (2013) and the “The Human Experience,” at the Florida State University Museum of Fine Arts (2015). Wall of Honor The Institute’s Wall of Honor are from some of the collections about men who were killed in action and received a Purple Heart.
