Women's and Gender Studies Women's and Gender Studies(WGS) are the interdisciplinary studies of the human experience that places women and gender at the center of scholarly inquiry. The WGS program emphasizes the intellectual, artistic, political, social, economic, and spiritual contributions of women, which traditional scholarship long overlooked or denigrated. WGS uses the lens of gender to extend this analysis to a broader range of issues, including the social and cultural meanings of masculinity, femininity, and identity construction. WGS also explores the way that race, class, nationality, religion, sexuality, and other social categories influence gender roles.
