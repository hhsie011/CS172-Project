The PhD program develops scholars who go on to conduct original research as members of the faculties of major global academic institutions. Research is emphasized throughout the program, and students are encouraged to work closely with the division’s faculty members to develop, conduct, and report significant scientific research. While students have considerable latitude in their choice of specific research areas, most activity falls into one of three areas: mathematical modeling of marketing phenomena, the use of behavioral science to explain customer choice, and managerial issues in marketing.
