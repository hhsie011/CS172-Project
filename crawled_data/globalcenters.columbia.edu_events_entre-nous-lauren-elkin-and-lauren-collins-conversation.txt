A public transport vigil, an observation of the world through the screen of her phone and from the height of her bus seat, a study of the counterpoint between the everyday and the Event, No. 91/92: A Diary of a Year on the Bus follows Elkin on her daily commutes from her apartment in the 5th Arrondissement to her teaching job in the 7th. The book, a love letter to Paris that unfolds over the course of the 2014-15 academic year, is also a meditation on how the city has changed in two decades, evolving from the twentieth century into the twenty-first, from analog to digital. *The discussion will be available both online and in-person. While the conversation will happen in-person (Elkin and Collins will appear in the Reading Room), the Library will stream the conversation on Zoom for a live viewing experience. Both in-person and online attendees will be able to pose questions.

A scholar of literature, Elkin has taught at New York University, the American University of Paris, the University of Liverpool, and the Université de Paris-Denis Diderot. Elkin’s last book, Flâneuse: Women Walk the City, was a finalist for the PEN/Diamonstein-Spielvogel Award for the Art of the Essay, a New York Times Notable Book of 2017, and a Radio 4 Book of the Week. Lauren Collins began contributing to the New Yorker in 2003 and became a staff writer in 2008. She is the author of When in French: Love in a Second Language, which the Times named as one of its 100 Notable Books of 2016. She is working on a second book, about a coup d’état perpetrated by white supremacists in Wilmington, North Carolina in 1898, and its effects on the city during the past 120 years. •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• Important: on-site information regarding COVID-19 In compliance with French regulations, a pass sanitaire is required for all visitors ages 12+.
