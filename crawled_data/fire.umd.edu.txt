FIRE announces FIRE Summer Research Internships for Summer 2022 for FIRE & other UMD undergraduates! Fearless research drives fearless career readiness. Our Mission FIRE provides first-year UMD students an inclusive faculty-mentored research experience that drives accelerated professional development and equality of opportunity. Research Experience Our students use authentic tools of the trade to attack broadly relevant research objectives. Outcomes are uncertain in a manner that allows students to thrive through challenge. Career Readiness Fearless research drives fearless career readiness: our students develop communication, critical thinking, equity and inclusion, leadership, professionalism, and teamwork traits that employers are seeking.
