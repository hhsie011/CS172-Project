Violators of the University of Miami's Moving Parking Policies and Procedures (Revised June 2020) will receive a parking citation. Parking citations must be appealed within 15 calendar days of citation issuance. Once the appeal is submitted and processed, the appellant is not required to take any further action until the appeal is judged and a decision issued. The appellant will be notified of the decision via e-mail within 6-8 weeks from receipt of the appeal. Following the initial appeal decision, a second level appeal may be requested. The citation must be paid in full prior to initiating the second level appeal. Submit the second level appeal to parking.gables@miami.edu within 15 calendar days from the issuance of the initial appeal decision. If the appeal is successful, the citation payment will be refunded. Click here for citation payment and appeal.

Being late does not allow the driver the privilege of parking illegally. There was no place to park or the lot was full. It is the driverâ€™s responsibility to locate legal parking. I was only parked for a few minutes. A short stay does not mitigate the violation, and it does not allow the driver the privilege of parking illegally. Nobody else around me got a ticket. Vehicles that are seen in violation of parking rules are cited. The fact that a given vehicle may not be cited is not permission for another to violate policy. This violation has not been enforced in the past. Prior lack of enforcement in no way constitutes a valid excuse for illegal parking. I have done it for years. Everybody does it. This is not an acceptable excuse for illegal parking. I did not see the citation on my vehicle. Citations are considered legally delivered when placed on the vehicle windshield or receipt by mail.
