He played over eighty leading roles on the DCTC stages and was an active part of the company's new play development program. Directing and acting work have taken him to other theatres around the country, including the Creede Repertory Theatre, the Commonweal Theatre Company, the Mark Taper Forum, the Cleveland Play House, and, closer to home, the New London Barn Playhouse and Northern Stage, where he played George Orwell in the world premiere of Orwell in America (written and directed by Dartmouth colleagues Joe Sutton and Peter Hackett, respectively). That production went on to an Off-Broadway run at 59E59 Theaters in New York City in October 2016. He had a twenty-year association with the National Theatre Conservatory's MFA program as adjunct teacher, leading master classes in acting, directing student projects, and mentoring dozens of young actors making their transition into the professional theatre. He has worked extensively in film, television and radio -- as actor, screenwriter and producer. He played a small role in Steven Spielberg's Lincoln and was the recipient of a Fox Foundation Fellowship in 2003. Professor Horton teaches acting and directing, and is the current Director of Theater. Directing credits at Dartmouth include Julius Caesar, Stop Kiss, The Liar, Spring Awakening, In the Next Room (or the vibrator play), and Urinetown.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Theater Undergraduate Overview Equity and Inclusivity Peer Advisors and Student Representatives The Major Major Requirements Honors Thesis The Modified Major Modified Major Requirements Modifying another Major with Theater The Minor Minor Requirements Courses: offerings by term Course Descriptions Instructor Permission Courses Independent Study Off-Campus Exchange National Theater Institute For Prospective Students Onstage Overview Get Involved Performing and Auditions Directing and Designing Playwriting Stage Managing The Scene Shop The Costume Shop Now Onstage: Upcoming Productions Season Archives: Past Productions Production Photos About Student Productions Workshops and Full Productions Studio Lab: Exploring Theatrical Boundaries YourSpace: Performance Spaces for Creative Minds Student Work in the time of COVID About MainStage Productions Opportunities Overview Summer Theater Lab: Cultivating New Work VoxLab Frost and Dodd Play Festival New York Theatre Workshop Residency The VOICES Program Experiential Learning with Northern Stage Testimonials Student Funding Opportunities Kingsdale Fund Need-Based Funding Goldner Mini-Fellowship Other funding opportunities Funding for Graduate Studies Internships, Fellowships, and Graduate Programs The Neukom Institute Literary Arts Award in Playwriting Foreign Study News & Events All News and Events MainStage Production News Student Production News Honors Thesis Productions Summer Theater Lab News Faculty News Student News Visiting Artist News Alumni News People Faculty and Staff Visiting Artists Alumni Tell Us Your Story Theater and Performance Studies My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
