(Wine photo by Pier Demarten on Unsplash. Illustration by Richard Clark/Dartmouth College) PreviousNext "This is a sound Cabernet. It's very dry and a little thin in blackberry fruit, which accentuates the acidity and tannins. Drink up." These tasting notes are the work of a reviewer who cannot sample the wine in question. They were written by a computer code developed in 2020 by a team of Dartmouth researchers—Dan Rockmore, professor of mathematics and computer science, former Neukom Institute fellow Allen Riddell, and Keith Carlson, Guarini '21. The algorithm, trained on hundreds of thousands of existing reviews, learned to craft original reviews of its own based on a set of product features, as well as synthesize a large volume of published reviews into a new one of its making. Convinced that the work would interest a wide audience, the team joined hands with faculty at the Tuck School of Business to reframe their code into "a market-friendly tool that can assist consumers, marketers, and professional reviewers."

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Computer Science Undergraduate Overview What You Will Learn Advice & Contact Declaring your CS Major/Minor Programs The Major Modified Majors The Minors Honors Program AIT-Budapest for Dartmouth Students Courses Upcoming Class Schedule Prizes Previous Winners Considering Graduate School?
