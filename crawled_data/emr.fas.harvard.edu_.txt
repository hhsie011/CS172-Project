About The Committee on Ethnicity, Migration, Rights (EMR) is a standing committee in the Faculty of Arts & Sciences. Secondary fields in EMR offer students an opportunity to pursue sustained, interdisciplinary study of ethnicity, migration, indigeneity, and human rights, with particular attention to Asian American and Pacific Islander, Latinx, and Native American topics. EMR also hosts five academic working groups in Asian American Studies, Dissertation Writing, Human Rights, Latinx Studies, Muslim American Studies. EMR is a vibrant community on campus including faculty, staff, graduate students, and undergraduates. The Committee hosts events, publishes a cross-listed course list, offers student research grants, connects students to mentors, and has a growing contingent of secondary concentrators. Study in EMR allows students to explore our core areas from a variety of disciplinary perspectives. Students who choose to pursue the secondary field can choose from a wide range of courses under the guidance of the Administrative and Program Director and members of the Faculty Advisory Committee.
