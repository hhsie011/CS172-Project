Volunteer your time and talents to help your fellow students, the Ithaca community or around the globe. The David M. Einhorn Center for Community Engagement connects students with community partners in Tompkins County and around the world. Cornell has one of the largest Orientation staff in the country. Each year, over 400 volunteers assist new students in making the transition to Cornell. Each residence hall has a student-led Hall Council which is dedicated to supporting the community experience. Organizations in the Dean of Students office, including the LGBT Resource Center and A3C welcome volunteers each year to help organize and run the centers' activities. Volunteering is a pillar of Greek life. Get involved with EARS (Empathy, Assistance & Referral Service) or explore other student organizations with service-minded missions. Student volunteers help keep Slope Day safe. Volunteer with the Women's Resource Center and help produce programs and events.
