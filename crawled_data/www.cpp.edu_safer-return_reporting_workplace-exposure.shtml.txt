Assembly Bill 685 requires employers to notify all employees who were at a worksite of all potential exposures to COVID-19 and notify the local public health agency of outbreaks. Why are some listings marked with an asterisk (*), which indicates a delayed report? Under California State Assembly Bill 685 (AB 685), Cal Poly Pomona is required to provide notification of potential workplace exposure to COVID-19 within one business day after a laboratory confirmed positive case is reported to the university. In some cases, the university receives a delayed report and is not made aware of a positive case until days later. Other situations that may delay notification include the timing of the test (when the test was taken) and how long it takes for test results to be available. Once notified, the university will provide notification within one business day on this webpage. How often is the data on this webpage updated? Data on this webpage is updated daily on business days (Monday to Friday) around 4 p.m. and includes reports from the previous business day. For example, the website update on Monday afternoon will include reports from the previous Friday and Saturday. Website updated on: Will include data from previous: Monday Friday, Saturday Tuesday Sunday, Monday Wednesday Tuesday Thursday Wednesday Friday Thursday How long will the data be posted on the webpage? Data of potential workplace exposure will be posted on this webpage for two weeks. Data will be retained in compliance with state and federal legal requirements. Why do some of the listings include a time element and others do not? The chart includes the information that was captured during the campus' incident investigation process. If a listing does not include a time element, then it means that the information was not provided to the university, not available, and/or not known during the investigation. What are the campus’ cleaning protocols around cleaning for confirmed COVID-19 cases? Custodial Services will provide routine cleaning and disinfection services if a confirmed COVID-19 case was in the facility within 24 hours of notification to the university. Visit the cleaning webpage for details on the campus cleaning and disinfection protocols. What should I do if I have symptoms or had a close contact with COVID-19? If you’re experiencing COVID-like symptoms, you may need to self-isolate. Do not come to campus or attend in-person activities. Visit the Reporting Guide webpage to learn about next steps for reporting a positive test, what to do if you have a close contact with COVID-19, as well as the quarantine and isolation process. If you have questions about the guidance, email healthscreener@cpp.edu.
