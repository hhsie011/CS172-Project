You're invited to a politically-themed trivia fundraiser on November 14 at Monnik Beer Company. The proceeds will support three students' internship-related expenses in Washington, DC this summer.\n\nDC internships are crucial for resume-building and networking, but these opportunities can be out of reach for many at UofL. You can also support the cause by helping us find the right placements on both sides of the partisan aisle. \n\nYou can register as an individual ($35 and we will place you on a team), or become a table sponsor/team captain for $250 (you choose your own teammates). Don't worry about flashbacks to high school. The format is NOT quick recall. You and your team will have time for spirited deliberation during each round. \n\nOther opportunities for support include the Sponsor Level ($500) and the Host Level ($1000). Both of these levels will receive special recognition as well as a table of six for the evening. Any donations above $35 are tax deductible to the extent allowed by law. \n\nFood, soft drinks, and two drink tickets are all included with your ticket. Cash bar will be available for additional beverages. We welcome UofL Political Science alumni and our extended Ford Hall family and friends. Hosted by Jim Cauley '92, Margaret Gonzalez-Perez '85, Brandon McReynolds '12, and the Political Science Alumni Council.\n\nIf you would like to join us as a table captain, sponsor, or host, click here.
