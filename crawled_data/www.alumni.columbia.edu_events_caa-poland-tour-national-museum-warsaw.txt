We will see the paintings of renowned Polish artists, including Aleksander Gierymski and Jacek Malczewski. Here is a note from Chloe about what we can expect: “It is an especially vibrant group of rooms that reflect a time when Poland consisted of a diverse mix of people and events - both dramatic and dynamic - much like the artists who rendered them. Every artist has a lot to say, both specific in their sense of style and illustration, and more broadly in the historical time in which they worked.” After the tour, you are invited to join us for pizza and drinks at a nearby restaurant (we will provide you with more details soon). Please RSVP by emailing [email protected] as soon as possible to make sure you’re on the list. When you RSVP, we will provide you with more logistics information (including museum tickets) closer to the date.
