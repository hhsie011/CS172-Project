The field of optics and photonics involves the study of lasers, optical data processing, nonlinear optics, optical communications, optical computing, optical data storage, optical system design and holography. These are the fundamental enabling technologies for future high-speed communication systems including high performance telecommunication and data communication networks. ECE offers its graduate students on-going opportunities to work as Graduate Research Assistants or Graduate Teaching Assistants. Virtually all Ph.D. students receive funding support through teaching or research. View Faculty members for Optics and Photonics Research Faculty and students in the Optics and Photonics Group are engaged in a range of basic and applied research projects, which are supported by a network of sponsors including the U.S. Army Research Office, the National Science Foundation, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Joint Services Electronics Program, and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, and many industrial sources. Optics and Photonics focuses on the exploitation of light waves and photons for communication, signal processing, imaging, sensing, computing, lighting, and energy harvesting. Optics and Photonics research falls within the following major areas: Optical Communication Networks Imaging and Display Nonlinear Optics Integrated Photonics and Optoelectronics Diffractive and Holographic Optics Nanophotonics and Nanoplasmonics Metamaterials and Metasurfaces Organic Photonics and Photovoltaics Academics The depth and breadth of faculty expertise in all areas of optics and photonics is reflected in the curriculum, which provides students with a solid foundation in such areas as fiber optics, laser theory, optical engineering and Fourier optics and holography. In addition to the core undergraduate and graduate courses taught at ECE, the School offers a joint undergraduate certificate in optics, in conjunction with the School of Physics.
