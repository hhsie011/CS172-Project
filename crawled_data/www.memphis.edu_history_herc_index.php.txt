The HERC is dedicated to providing educational support, including academic advising, writing and study tutoring, internship opportunities, information sessions, and career and postgraduate counseling to all UofM students interested and/or taking courses in the field of history. The HERC is a student-centered space where students come not just to get degree counseling, but to get help with their history work and writing, and to plan their futures. Staffed by two instructor/advisors and two graduate writing tutors, the center is an advising center, writing center, and student community and study center all in one. HERC Spring 2022 Our on-campus tutoring center and study space is open Monday-Thursday from 10am-2pm. You can come by for tutoring, to use a computer, print papers, or just to hang out or study. Virtual tutoring is available Monday from 9-1 and Friday from 10-2 on Upswing at https://memphis.upswing.io/ . You can also drop papers for contactless review on Upswing. You will get an edited draft back within 24 hours, except for the weekends, when our tutors are unavailable. If you drop a paper on Friday after 2pm, the earliest you will receive a reply in late Monday morning. If you are on a deadline, it is usually best to come by the center for help, if possible. Center Safety HERC capacity will be limited to 10 people at a time. The HERC is outfitted with three hand sanitizer stations and our tutors will have a large sneeze guard at their desk. Each student table will be limited to two students and will be equipped with a sneeze guard to divide workspaces. Virtual Tutoring/Contactless Paper Review To create a virtual tutoring appointment through Upswing https://memphis.upswing.io/ first log in to the system and then click the "tutoring" icon. To find available appointments, you can either search for our tutors (Kelsie Carper/Damarius Harris) or put in your course code (i.e. HIST 2010). Please be sure to schedule your virtual appointment at least 30 minutes in advance of the time you would like to meet. If you find that Kelsie or Damarius don't have tutoring hours that fit your schedule, an Upswing history tutor may be available to help you at your preferred time. You can also drop a paper in the "Assignment Review" section of Upswing at any time for our tutors to review. During the week, please give us at least 24 hours to return your paper to you with comments and suggestions. Tutors do not work on the weekends, so again, if you drop a paper Friday after 2pm, you will not receive feedback till Monday. For additional Upswing information and video tutorials, please check out this link to our Educational Support Program's (ESP) Upswing page. If you have any trouble accessing the system and/or finding Kelsie or Damarius within it, please reach out to U of M's Coordinator of Virtual Learning, Mr. Jamion McNeil, at jgmcneil@memphis.edu.
