In the summer of 2005, with only a camera and hand-held GPS unit, Anthony Acciavatti arrived in India as a Fulbright Fellow to map the most densely populated river basin in the world. During his increasingly long expeditions into the mountains and plains, he began to obsessively record the cycles of the Ganges River, the iconic watercourse of India that reached everywhere. For nearly a decade, Acciavatti crisscrossed the Ganges River by foot and boat, deploying new methods of mapping cities and towns as well as the rhythms of the monsoon. His book, Ganges Water Machine: Designing New India’s Ancient River (awarded the John Brinckerhoff Jackson Book Prize for 2016), is a dynamic atlas of the Ganges River basin—the first such comprehensive atlas in half a century.
