References provide a valuable complement to interviews and provide an opportunity to gain insight regarding the prior employer's views about the applicant's work performance, accomplishments, strengths and weakness. A consistent method of reviewing these references will contribute to a fair assessment of candidates. In addition, it allows hiring managers to verify information that the applicant has provided including but not limited to dates of employment, job title/position, responsibilities, and reason for leaving.
