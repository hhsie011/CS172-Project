These materials should be isolated from the general wastes and discarded directly into labeled containers which identify them as such. Please see Advisory 10.1 - Legislation Regarding Infectious Waste Management for more information. Chemical Waste chemicals which have the properties of toxicity, flammability, reactivity or corrosivity are considered hazardous wastes. These chemicals must be isolated from solid (normal trash) waste and properly containerized and labeled for disposition. Please see Advisory 7.3 - Management of Chemical Wastes for more information. Departments or employees who generate chemical or infectious waste can contact Environmental Health & Safety for disposal information.

(reillymb) Sent: Tuesday, November 10, 2020 1:37 PM To: UC-TRIPLE-D Subject: [UC-TRIPLE-D] Chemical Waste Disposal Fee Increase DATE: November 10, 2020 TO: Deans, Directors and Department Heads FROM: Patrick Clark, Associate Vice President, Operations and Business Intelligence Patrick Kowalski, Vice President, Finance RE: Chemical Waste Disposal Fee Increase The chemical waste assessment fee will increase to 1.85% effective November 1, 2020. The disposal of chemical waste for the University of Cincinnati is funded by charging a monthly assessment fee to expenses charged on laboratory supply general ledger codes. 531900 – Lab Expenses 531901 – Lab Supplies 531902 – Lab device/non-equipment 531903 – Chemical Solutions 531905 – Bio agents/toxins 531906 – Liquids & gases 531907 – Glassware 531908 – Lab linens 531909 – Rubber goods 531910 – UC Scientific Core Svc 531911 – Chemistry stockroom 531912 – Physics stockroom The program is operated on a cost recovery basis and will not make or lose money. To accomplish this, the monthly assessment is evaluated and raised or lowered to meet this cost recovery goal. The current assessment fee of 1.75% will increase to 1.85% due to increased disposal costs and reduced lab supply expenditures. The assessed charges will be charged to the same fund, cost center, and functional area that was used for the lab and chemical supply purchases with the exception of Grant and Service Center funds. Grant and Service Center fund assessments will be charged to the Facilities and Administrative (F&A) overhead fund (D7) for the college associated with the grant or service center. Exception: IT@UC, Utilities, and other service center funds without F&A overhead fund will be charged for their assessments via their non-service center core fund. The proceeds from this assessment will be recorded in the Chemical Disposal Lab Waste designated Service Center Fund D600057. With this program, the funds for disposal of chemicals/hazardous wastes will be accumulated as the chemicals are purchased and should help reduce the amounts of chemicals and hazardous waste on campuses. If you have any questions about the administration of this program, please contact Lisa Deckard at deckarlm@ucmail.uc.edu.
