We offer a multitude of academic, leadership, and community engagement opportunities to develop students who are scholars and lifelong learners.  The Honors Program is comprised of two highly successful programs: University Honors and Honors in the Major. In addition, based on their honors application and subsequent in-person interview, incoming University Honors students may be selected to participate in Florida State University’s prestigious Presidential Scholars Program. Upon graduation, alumni can stay connected through mentorship and engagement opportunities with our alumni network, Friends of HSF. Visit the Alumni & Giving page to learn more.

High school students can apply to University Honors while completing their general FSU application, and freshmen may apply for lateral admission to the program during their first fall semester. Honors in the Major Program The Honors in the Major Program (HITM) supports eligible students in completing and defending an honors thesis in their major, which serves to strengthen their post-graduate endeavors. Students of all disciplines may apply to HITM and pursue traditional research or creative projects. Presidential Scholars The Presidential Scholars award is the premier undergraduate merit scholarship at FSU, providing four years of academic and financial support. Presidential Scholars engage in educational, research, and experiential opportunities and build meaningful relationships with university faculty, staff, and a cohort of peers.
