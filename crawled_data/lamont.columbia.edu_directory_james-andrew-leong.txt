I am primarily interested in understanding the nature and dynamics of fluid-mineral interactions and their implications for the chemical and redox processes in surficial and deep Earth reservoirs, and the habitability of rock-hosted environments in our planet and beyond. I also study carbon mineralization reactions as a strategy for carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) and curbing increasing CO2 levels in the atmosphere.
