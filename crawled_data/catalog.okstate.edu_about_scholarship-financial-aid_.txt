financial assistance to attend college are encouraged to consider the many types of financial aid available through the OSU Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid. These programs include scholarships, grants, loans and part-time jobs. More than 80 percent of all OSU students receive some type of financial assistance to fund their education. Scholarship Programs Oklahoma State University offers tuition waiver scholarships and other cash scholarships to qualifying freshman, transfer, continuing and graduate students. In addition to the scholarships discussed here, students are encouraged to contact community and/or tribal agencies, as appropriate, to inquire about non-OSU scholarships. OSU’s scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic achievement, academic potential, leadership activities or community service, and many consider financial need. Scholarships are funded by various campus academic and administrative offices, the OSU Foundation, or in conjunction with private industry, private foundations, the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education (OSRHE) and the state of Oklahoma. Selected state programs, such as the OSRHE Academic Scholars Program, accept scores recorded on national test dates only. The OSU scholarship program accepts both national test scores and residual tests taken at OSU. State and University agencies may establish a cap on total scholarship dollars a student may receive from state and University sources, precluding students from receiving funds that exceed legitimate educational costs. The Undergraduate Application for Admission and Scholarships serves as the scholarship application for all new undergraduate students. Scholarships for continuing undergraduate students are awarded based on academic performance, financial need or both. Continuing undergraduate students should also check with their academic college and departments regarding application procedures and deadlines. Graduate students seeking cash or tuition scholarships should contact their academic departments and the Graduate College regarding application procedures and deadlines. Important Dates December 1st prior to fall entering OSU: Due to the current circumstances of COVID-19 and the challenges with standardized testing, we are extending our scholarship deadline to Feb. 1 for incoming students. However, we will begin awarding some competitive scholarships as early as December, so we encourage students to submit their application materials (including test scores) as early as they are available for consideration. February 1st prior to fall entering OSU: To be considered for all scholarships at OSU, new undergraduates must apply for admission prior to the February 1st Priority Scholarship Deadline. July 1st prior to fall entering OSU: Absolute deadline to apply for admission and to submit new or updated academic information (GPA/test score). Students entering OSU in the spring: The final deadline for students entering OSU in the spring is the Friday before the spring semester begins. Tuition Scholarships Tuition scholarships are awarded to both in-state and out-of-state students, and they vary in value and length. Tuition scholarships for in-state students are awarded to incoming freshman students who have attained high scholastic standing in high school. Tuition scholarships for out-of-state students are awarded based on several criteria, including academic accomplishments or being a child or grandchild of an OSU alumnus. Students receiving an out-of-state tuition scholarship have some or all of their out-of-state tuition charges waived and pay in-state tuition rates and the remainder of any out-of-state tuition not covered by this scholarship. Transfer tuition scholarships are offered to outstanding students transferring to OSU from two-year and four-year colleges. A student may receive only one tuition scholarship at a time. However, students may receive multiple cash awards such as the President’s Distinguished Scholarship (PDS), President’s Leadership Council (PLC) scholarship, or college and departmental awards. Each student with a multiple-year scholarship is required to meet specific renewal criteria to continue receiving his or her scholarship the following year (up to a specified maximum number of years of eligibility). Cash Scholarships A variety of cash scholarships are offered to OSU students at all levels of study. Funding for these awards comes from several sources, including the OSU Foundation, the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, OSU academic colleges and departments, and private sources. Undergraduate students can find more information about OSU and non-OSU cash scholarships in the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid, 119 Student Union, or online at financialaid.okstate.edu. Graduate students can find more information by contacting the OSU Graduate College. Federal/State Aid Programs Federal aid at OSU is awarded on the basis of demonstrated financial need. Each student who wishes to be considered for need-based assistance should submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) as soon after October 1 as possible to receive aid for the next academic year. Early application is encouraged since OSU receives limited funding for the Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) and Federal Work-Study (FWS) programs. Funding for state grants, including the Oklahoma Tuition Aid Grant (OTAG), is limited and earliest applicants receive priority for funds. Students can apply for assistance by submitting the FAFSA electronically at fafsa.gov. FAFSA information is used to determine demonstrated need for federal, state and institutional programs such as Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Oklahoma Tuition Aid Grants (OTAG), Federal Direct Loans, Federal Work-Study (FWS) and some tuition scholarships. There are also programs available for students and families who do not demonstrate financial need. The Federal Direct Parent (PLUS) Loan Program, the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan Program and the Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan allow students and parents of dependent undergraduates, to borrow funds to meet educational expenses. To be considered for financial aid, a student must: File the FAFSA and demonstrate financial need, except for some loan and scholarship programs. Be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen. Be enrolled as a degree-seeking candidate, including a program of study abroad or be pursuing a graduate certificate approved for financial aid eligibility by the U.S. Department of Education. Meet minimum satisfactory academic progress standards. Have a high school diploma or GED. Not be in default on any federal loan, not have borrowed in excess of the allowable limits and not owe a refund to any federal grant program (including the Oklahoma Tuition Aid Grant program). Be prompt in responding to any requests for additional information made by the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid. Students and parents are encouraged to contact the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid for information regarding financial assistance programs or to make an appointment with a financial aid counselor to discuss specific eligibility requirements. The office has information about programs and services online at financialaid.okstate.edu. Grants Undergraduate students who have not completed their first bachelor's degree are eligible to be considered for the Federal Pell Grant and the Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant. Undergraduate students who are Oklahoma residents are considered for the Oklahoma Tuition Aid Grant (OTAG). Federal Pell Grant eligibility is determined by the U.S. Department of Education by using a congressionally-approved formula and information from the FAFSA. Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants (SEOG) are awarded to students who demonstrate financial need as reflected in the FAFSA. Funding in this program is limited and is usually awarded to applicants who demonstrate the most financial need. Undergraduate, post-baccalaureate and graduate students who are or who will be taking coursework necessary to become elementary or secondary teachers may be eligible for the federal Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant. The FAFSA is the application for TEACH eligibility. A recipient must sign the Agreement to Serve saying he or she will teach full-time in a designated teacher shortage area for four complete years (within eight years of completing the academic program) at an elementary or secondary school serving children from low-income families. If the student fails to carry out the service obligation, the TEACH Grant must be repaid as a Direct Unsubsidized Loan with interest accrued from the date the grant was first disbursed. The Oklahoma Tuition Aid Grant (OTAG) is awarded to eligible undergraduate Oklahoma residents who may apply by completing the FAFSA. Grant amounts are determined by the applicant's enrollment status, demonstrated need and by the availability of funds. Federal Work-Study The Federal Work-Study (FWS) program is designed to help students meet their educational expenses through part-time employment. The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid determines award amounts on the basis of financial need from FAFSA information. While all Federal Work-Study student employees are paid at least the current federal minimum wage, the actual rate of pay depends on their qualifications and the types of jobs they hold. Eligible students may be employed by any participating office or department at OSU or at an approved off-campus, non-profit agency. Loans OSU has several loan programs for students who need financial assistance. These funds are available to students who meet the eligibility requirements of the various programs and are making satisfactory progress in their college work. Long-term loan programs consist of the Federal Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans, Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan, and the Federal Direct Parent (PLUS) Loan. The FAFSA is required to be considered for any of these loans. Interest rates for the Federal Direct Loan programs are set annually by the federal government. The U.S. Department of Education pays the interest on the Federal Direct Subsidized Loan while the student is enrolled at least half-time and during the loan grace period (six months after ceasing half-time enrollment for the Direct Subsidized Loan). Interest accrues, but can be deferred, for the Federal Direct Unsubsidized, Graduate PLUS and Parent PLUS loans. The OSU-sponsored Short-Term Loan Program provides up to a maximum of $300 per semester (less a $10 service charge) for the purpose of meeting educationally-related expenses that are not charged to a student's University account. Students are billed for the loan through the Office of the Bursar on the billing statement of the month in which they apply. Applications must be made in person at the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid. Enrollment Requirements To be considered for loan funds, undergraduates must be enrolled in at least six hours in the fall, spring or summer semester. Undergraduates who plan to enroll in fewer than six hours for the semester may still be eligible for limited grant funding. Undergraduate tuition scholarship recipients must be enrolled in at least 12 OSU hours to receive the award for the fall or spring semester; tuition scholarships are not available for the summer. Scholarship recipients should review their award information to determine whether additional hours of enrollment are required to retain the scholarship for the following year. Graduate students must be enrolled in at least four hours in the fall or spring semester and at least two hours in the summer to be considered for financial assistance for that semester. TEACH funding is available but limited for eligible students enrolled in fewer than four hours in the fall/spring or two hours in the summer. Graduate students receiving tuition scholarships from their academic departments or the Graduate College should contact the awarding office for enrollment requirements. Federal and institutional aid recipients who are unsure of their eligibility for assistance based on their enrollment status should contact the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid for clarification. Recipients of non-OSU scholarships should check with the awarding agency to determine the minimum enrollment required for payment. Eligibility for financial assistance is related only to the total number of credit hours in which the student enrolls. Certifiable enrollment status, based upon a combination of enrollment and employment (such as a graduate assistant enrolled in six hours with a 50% graduate assistant appointment), only assists with the deferral of loan repayment, never qualification for aid. Students are encouraged to review the policies related to financial aid eligibility for repeat courses and minors in the eligible coursework section of the OSU Cost & Aid website. All courses must count toward degree requirements to be included for financial aid eligibility. Return to Title IV Funds Policy The OSU Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid, in accordance with federal regulations, calculates the return of Title IV Funds for any student who receives Title IV aid and subsequently withdraws before the end of the enrollment period/term. The full policy, including official and unofficial withdrawals, aid considered in the calculation, institutional charges, attendance and earned/unearned percentage, unearned aid by the institution, unearned aid by the student, post-withdrawal disbursement, and notification of the results of the calculation, can be found on the web at financialaid.okstate.edu. Academic Progress The OSU Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid is required by federal regulation to monitor the academic progress of all students who apply for financial assistance. The official record of the OSU Office of the Registrar is reviewed to determine student compliance with the policy. The policy for federal aid and state (OTAG) recipients includes three components. Students must: not exceed a maximum number of hours allowed for completion of the degree program; maintain a minimum cumulative Graduation/Retention Grade Point Average; and maintain a satisfactory pace toward program completion, defined as successful completion of at least 67% of the total cumulative hours attempted. A copy of the policy detailing the requirements is included with every award notice and is also available in the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid and online at financialaid.okstate.edu. Each undergraduate with a multiple-year scholarship is required to meet specific renewal criteria to continue receiving his or her scholarship the following year; the policy for each scholarship is included with the award letter and is available from the OSU Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid. Recipients of athletic grant-in-aid must meet the eligibility requirements of the program. Professional Education Certification To receive financial assistance, students who are classified by the Graduate College as non-degree students and who are also pursuing Professional Education certification must be enrolled in a required program for elementary or secondary teacher certification or recertification in Oklahoma (must be required to teach); and be enrolled in at least six hours in the fall or spring semesters or three hours in the summer term. Professional Education students are eligible to apply for consideration in Federal Work-Study and Direct Loans (Subsidized and Unsubsidized). Due to the unique nature of the Professional Education program, students are encouraged to schedule an appointment with a financial aid counselor to discuss the required documentation needed for financial aid eligibility. Approved Undergraduate and Graduate Certificates Students who are pursuing an undergraduate or graduate certificate approved for financial aid eligibility by the U.S. Department of Education are eligible for the same aid programs as undergraduate and graduate students pursuing bachelor's, master’s, doctorate, or professional degrees at OSU. Approved certificates are listed on the web. Programs can be added or removed from this list as determined by the OSU Office of Academic Affairs, Graduate College and the U.S. Department of Education. Prerequisite Course Work for Admission to a Graduate Program To be considered for federal assistance, students generally must be enrolled in a recognized academic program leading to a degree or certificate. However, if a student is enrolled at least half-time in course work that is required for admission to a graduate program at OSU, the student may be eligible for loan consideration for one calendar year (12 months) beginning on the first day of the loan period. Students are only eligible for Ford Federal Direct Loan consideration. Preparatory students who wish to be considered for assistance should schedule an appointment with a financial aid counselor to discuss their particular circumstances.
