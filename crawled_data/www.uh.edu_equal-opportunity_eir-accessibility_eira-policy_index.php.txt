Consistent with this commitment, the System strives to provide Electronic and Information Resources(“EIRS”) that are accessible to all members of the University community and that meet the requirements of the Texas Department of Information Resources (“DIR” or “Department”). [1.2] The purpose of the Electronic and Information Resources Accessibility Policy is to establish rules for the procurement, development, maintenance, and use of electronic and information resources that will be accessible for persons with disabilities. [1.3] This Policy covers all EIR content and technology including, but not limited to, websites, web-based and mobile applications, email, web conferencing, video conferencing, video streaming, instructional materials (including documents and course content included in Learning Management Systems), electronic documents, blended and online courses, and all academic and administrative software applications acquired or adopted. The Policy also requires a method to ensure that communication at University-wide events is accessible and enables full participation. SCOPE [2.1] This Policy applies to students, faculty, staff, visitors to campus, vendors and suppliers. DEFINITIONS [3.1] Electronic and Information Resource or Electronic and Information Resources (“EIR” or “EIRS”) - Information Technology and any equipment or interconnected system or subsystem of equipment that is used in the creation, conversion, duplication, storage or delivery of data or information. EIR includes, but is not limited to, telecommunications products (such as telephones), information kiosks and transaction machines, web sites, multimedia, and office equipment such as copiers and fax machines. The term does not include any equipment that contains embedded information technology that is used as an integral part of the product, but the principal function of which is not the acquisition, storage, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information. For example, Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) equipment such as thermostats or temperature control devices, and medical equipment where information technology is integral to its operation, and are not considered information technology. However, if the embedded information has an externally available web or computer interface, that interface is considered EIR (TAC 213.1(9)). [3.2] Exception - A justified, documented non-compliance with one or more standards or specifications of Texas Administrative Code, Chapter 206 and/or Chapter 213 of this title, which has been approved by the Chancellor (TAC 213.1(11)). [3.3] EIR Accessibility Coordinator - The employee designated by the President or Chancellor to develop, monitor, support and maintain its accessibility policy institution-wide (TAC 213.41). [3.4] Information Technology - Terms such as, but not limited to, Information and Communications Technology (“ICT”), Information Technology (“IT”), Electronic Information Technology (“EIT”), etc. can be considered interchangeable terms with EIR for purposes of applicability or compliance with TAC 213 (TAC 213.1(9)). [3.5] Product – Electronic and Information Technology (TAC 213.1(12)). [3.6] Self-Contained, Closed Products - Products which generally have embedded software and are commonly designed in such a fashion that a user cannot easily attach or install assistive technology. These products include, but are not limited to, information kiosks in information transaction machines, copiers, printers, calculators, fax machines and other similar products (TAC 213.1(14)). [3.7] TAC Accessibility Rules - Rules issued by the DIR regarding the development, procurement, maintenance and use of EIRs by institutions of higher education and set forth in Title 1, Chapter 206, Rule 206.70 of the Texas Administrative Code (“TAC 206.70”)and in Title 1, Chapter 213 of the Texas Administrative Code (“TAC 213”). [3.8] Technical Accessibility Standards and Specifications - Accessibility standards and specifications for Texas agency and institution of higher education websites and EIR set forth in Texas Administrative Code, Chapter 206 and/or Chapter 213 of this title. [3.9] Telecommunications - The transmission, between or among points specified by the user, of information of the user’s choosing, without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received (TAC 213.1(16)).
