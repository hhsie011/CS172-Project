March 23, 2022 // Posted In Alumni, Athletics, Service To the most recent generation of Baylor Family members, the Foster name is synonymous with campus growth and exciting new facilities. The Paul L. Foster Success Center brought academic and career counseling and support together in Sid Rich back in 2007, and the Foster Campus for Business and Innovation provided a stunning new home for the Hankamer School of Business when it debuted in 2015. Both were made possible by gifts from Paul (BBA ’79) and Alejandra Foster, and are now integral parts of the Baylor campus. Even more stunning generosity was revealed last year, when the Fosters were recognized as the previously anonymous benefactors of the largest current gift in Baylor history — a $100 million donation that sparked the Give Light campaign, created what’s now known as the Foster Academic Challenge, and jumpstarted the funding of Baylor basketball’s new home, the Paul and Alejandra Foster Pavilion. So… Who are Paul and Alejandra Foster? Paul Foster is a Baylor alum who was deeply influenced by his Hankamer experience, especially the impact of the school’s longtime professor and dean, Dr. Terry Maness (BA ’71, MS ’72). Foster came to Baylor in 1975 and worked a variety of jobs to pay bills while pursuing his degree. But he also made time for fun and service; among his favorite activities as a student were familiar favorites such as participating in Sing, attending basketball games, and serving in Student Foundation. After college, he went into the oil refining business, eventually founding Franklin Mountain Investments LLC, an investment and operating company with holdings in real estate, energy, aviation, sports and more. Alejandra De la Vega-Foster likewise was shaped by a lifetime in business. She serves as vice president of a company that operates convenience stores in Mexico, owns the Domino’s Pizza franchise in Juarez, and is co-owner and president of Franklin Mountain Franchise Ventures LLC. Today, the couple resides in El Paso, where their philanthropy has helped foster community growth. Among the organizations that have benefitted from their impact are the University of Texas at El Paso, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso, and the El Paso Zoo. They are also co-founders of the sports ownership group that includes the El Paso Chihuahuas (Triple-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres) and soccer clubs in El Paso and Juarez. For their incredible generosity to (and service of) Baylor, the Fosters were named the 2022 recipients of Baylor’s Founders Medal, one of the university’s highest honors. “Paul and Alejandra share a commitment to excellence in higher education and a love for Baylor University,” says Baylor President Linda Livingstone. “You can see the impact of their giving spread across campus, with each gift to scholarships, faculty endowment, student success programs or the buildings bearing their names, telling the story of their commitment to the support and success of our Baylor students… We are grateful for their philanthropy.” Sic ’em, Paul and Alejandra Foster!
