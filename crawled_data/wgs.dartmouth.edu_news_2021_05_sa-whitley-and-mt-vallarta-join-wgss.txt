Whitley is a black queer feminist scholar from Silver Spring, Maryland with an MA in African American Studies and a PhD in Gender Studies from UCLA. Currently, they work as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women and the Gender & Sexuality Studies Program at Brown University (2020-21). As a black feminist ethnographer of capitalist urbanization and black queer spatial imaginaries, their research and community organizing projects examine housing justice movements, financialization, urban planning strategies, and the politics of historic architectural preservation. Their forthcoming book manuscript entitled The Collective Come-Up: Black Queer Placemaking in Subprime Baltimore maps the collective efforts of black queer and transgender women who strategically renegotiate their relationship to private property and real estate markets after predatory experiences and dispossession during the subprime foreclosure crisis. Throughout their dissertation fieldwork in Baltimore, Maryland, Whitley was a Visiting Grad Scholar in the Department of Anthropology at Johns Hopkins University and a Part-Time Faculty Member in the Department of Humanistic Studies at the Maryland Institute College of Art. Their research has been supported by the UC Consortium for Black Studies and the Center for the Study of Women. MT Vallarta is the 2021-2023 Guarini Dean's Pre-to-Postdoctoral Fellow in Asian American Studies with an appointment in WGSS. They are a Ph.D. candidate in Ethnic Studies at the University of California, Riverside where they research feminist theory, queer theory, and contemporary Filipinx poetics. Their dissertation, Knowing, Feeling: Toward a Queer Filipinx Poetics, investigates the anti-imperialist tradition of queer Filipinx poetry, how this critical art practice incites and aggravates our capacity for transformative change and is fundamental to political mobilization. Their research has appeared and is forthcoming in The Velvet Light Trap, VICE, The Asian American Literary Review, and others. A Kundiman Fellow, MT is also a poet and has creative writing published and forthcoming in Blanket Sea, Nat. Brut, Apogee Journal, TAYO Literary Magazine, and others.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Program in Women's, Gender, &amp; Sexuality Studies Undergraduate Overview Major Modified Major Minor Honors Program Honors Thesis Guidelines Past Honors Theses Courses Previous Terms Associated Courses Independent Study Transfer Credit Alumni Stories Tell Us Your News Research Overview Gender Research Institute at Dartmouth Resources News & Events News & Events Annual Stonewall Lecture Past Lecture Series People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
