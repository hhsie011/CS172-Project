It is home to Eagles who love to get together two to three times a year, particularly around service, game watches (with traveling to Yankee Stadium and West Point to see Boston College play) and social events, especially centering around admitted students. The chapter’s Global Days of Service events helped rebuild after Hurricane Sandy. 2,815 Alumni Parents & Friends social leaders contact us events Follow Us Jersey Shore Chapter Facebook Page Meet Your Chapter Leaders Chuck Hopkins II '75, JD '79, P'06, '12, '14, '18 Lives in: Jersey Shore Major: English and Philosophy Occupation: Retired Attorney Favorite BC Memory: Fun times in the Mods and Shaw House, seminars, professors, and discussions with students Why did you get involved in your local chapter?: The great community of people, the camaraderie and love for BC in the area! What are your local favorites in your city?: Spending time at the Cabana on the Beach, hiking and running at Sandy Hook and the Long Branch Boardwalk, great eating in Red Bank, Asbury Park and on the Peninsula, local game watches and other BC alumni, parents, or student gatherings. In my free time I also love reaching out to accepted student applicants and their parents sharing the BC experience. Fun Fact: All of my four daughters went to BC. Additionally, Baldwin made an appearance at my oldest daughter’s wedding reception! Alumni Staff Liaison Name: Ana Mirovic Contact: ana.mirovic@bc.edu Events ENGAGE WITH US ON EAGLE EXCHANGE!
