Cinema and Television Arts is one of four departments in the College of Communications providing access to the vibrant and media-rich Orange County and Los Angeles Basin. Degree Descriptions The Bachelor of Arts degree includes a variety of courses in critical studies, management, production and writing that examine many aspects of film and television. Professionally engaged faculty challenge students to expand their knowledge and skills through intellectual inquiry and creative projects, encouraging them to become critical lifelong learners and ethical media content creators and consumers. At the undergraduate level, students demonstrate a basic knowledge of historical, legal and ethical issues that connect the current and future media environment to a larger historical context, employing information literacy in the process. They apply theoretical and ethical concepts in a practical media environment and apply key concepts of visual design to moving images. They describe and explain the development of at least one national media form, evaluate the role of diversity throughout all aspects of the entertainment industries, and write well-executed treatments, scripts, critical essays and/or research papers. The Master of Fine Arts degree is an intensive, two-year program focusing on writing for film, television and other narrative media, and includes courses to prepare students for work as professional screenwriters and/or screenwriting educators. Students in the M.F.A. program strengthen their writing skills, both in craft and creativity and learn about the professional life of a screenwriter and its demands and opportunities. These graduate students also develop the skills to evaluate and make decisions that are ethical and sensitive to issues of diversity; strengthen the profile of CSU Fullerton in the professional film and television communities and create an ongoing network for their fellow students. Finally, they deepen their knowledge of film and television history, theory and criticism.
