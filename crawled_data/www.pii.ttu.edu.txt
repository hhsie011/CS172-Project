Dr. McGlone studied animal behavior and physiology (immunology and neuroscience) in relation to farm animal performance starting in 1976 when he was an undergraduate in the laboratory of Dr. Keith Kelley (then at Washington State University). After his M.S. with Keith, he continued his studies with Dr. Stan Curtis and Dr. Ed Banks at the University of Illinois. After a 3-year faculty appointment at the University of Wyoming, Dr. McGlone moved to TTU. This laboratory began in 1984. We have broadened our studies from pigs to include cattle, horses, dogs, cats, rats, and mice. We employ measures of animal behavior and physiology to answer questions about animal health and welfare. Our measures have evolved over time. We have tackled the most difficult animal behavior and welfare problems with the aim of improving the lives of both animals and people. Current Laboratory Members Dr. John J.
