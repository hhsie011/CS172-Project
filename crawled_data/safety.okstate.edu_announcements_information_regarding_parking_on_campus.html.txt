Spaces close to residential life buildings can be hard to find, or sometimes nonexistent. Steve Spradling, director of Parking and Transit, said there are more parking spaces on campus than the university has sold parking permits for. It’s just not possible for everyone to get a space close to their buildings, so walking a few minutes from an overflow lot may be necessary. “In all, we have 16,782 spaces on campus,” he said. “We’ve sold 15,345 student, faculty and staff permits. Additional permits were sold for folks who aren’t on campus every day like vendors and retirees. The total number of spaces available still exceeds the number of permits sold. Our parking situation is much better than most or all schools in the Big 12. We have enough parking spaces; they’re just not all right by the buildings.” Spradling encourages students to remember the following: Students living on campus can park in several overflow lots. Many are a five- or six-minute walk from residential life complexes. Don’t want to walk from an overflow lot to a res hall? OSU buses run every 10-15 minutes weekdays from 6:20 a.m. to 6 p.m., and it’s free for students s. One route runs every 20 minutes from 5:45 p.m. to 10:35 p.m. Don’t want to take the bus, or the bus has stopped running for the day? Students can request a SafeWalk from the OSU Police Department. Use the Rave Guardian app or call 405-744-6523. A public safety officer or OSU Police officer will meet you on campus at your car and walk you back to a res life building, any building on campus or Greek Housing. Students can also park in the staff and commuter lots after hours, from 5 p.m. to 5 a.m. The cars will need to be moved the next weekday morning. “We wish it were possible for everyone to park next to their building, but we’re thankful we do have enough spaces on campus,” Spradling said. “Please take advantage of OSU Transit, not only to park and ride back to a residential life building, but to get around town as well.” Have more questions?
