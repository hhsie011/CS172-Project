CIS was elevated to the School of Risk Management and Insurance (SRMI) in the Fall of 2019. As a provider of the largest risk management talent pool in California, the School of Risk Management and Insurance educates, empowers and provides in-depth training to students ensuring they are well prepared for the many industry and societal challenges that lie ahead. The school is the leading insurance research institute for Asian insurance carriers due to the Insurance Competency Research Project it produces. European and U.S. investors utilize the School's research data for decision making while Chinese regulators utilize the data to develop a National Insurance Competency Blue Book. Working professionals have the opportunity to meet continuing education need through the California Department of Insurance certified events held by the School. Its Actuary Leadership Forum, Insurance Day, Excess and Surplus Lines Day, Insurance Forum, Risk Management Awareness Week, and SRMI Alumni Reunion events provide a direct connection between students and employers.
