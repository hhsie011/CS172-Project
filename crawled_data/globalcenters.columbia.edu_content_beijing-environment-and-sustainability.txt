Working with SEAS, the Center on Global Energy Policy, and other participants, the Beijing Center is organizing discussions and facilitating collaborations to further the bilateral cooperation between Columbia and China. In 2021, responding to the energy needs, climate change challenges and opportunities in green technologies among emerging Asian nations, the Beijing Center developed a Global Seminar Series titled on Energy and Climate Change in Emerging Asia, in partnership with Columbia SIPA Center on Global Energy Policy and the Mumbai Center.
