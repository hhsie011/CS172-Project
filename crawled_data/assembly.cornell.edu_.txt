[field_active] Assemblies of the University A Part of Shared Governance at Cornell Chartered by the President of the University with delegated authority from the Board of Trustees, the Assemblies serve as advisory bodies to the administration, representing matters of concern and constituent interests to University leadership. The assemblies formally advise the administration and recommend changes to policies through legislative processes articulated in their respective charters. The three constituent assemblies–representing undergraduate students, graduate and professional students, and staff–and the all-constituency University Assembly, along with the Faculty Senate, comprise Shared Governance at Cornell. The fundamental mission of the Assemblies is to obtain extensive involvement of community members in the formulation and review of non-academic policies, recommendations and decisions impacting daily lives on campus. Undergraduate Students Find your representatives, learn about the Student Assembly, and how to get involved. Graduate and Professional Students Find your representative, learn about the Graduate and Professional Student Assembly, and how to get involved. Staff Members Find your representative, learn about the Employee Assembly, and how to get involved. Cornell Community Members Get involved in the University Assembly, or contact the Dean of Faculty for more opportunities.
