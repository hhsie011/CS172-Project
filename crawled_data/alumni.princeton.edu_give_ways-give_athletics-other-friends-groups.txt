Alumni volunteers work diligently to secure the philanthropic and volunteer support that enables coaches to recruit and develop some of the finest scholar-athletes in the world, and to provide those young men and women with the best possible experience. There are currently 17 Athletics Friends Groups; annual gifts to a group can be used immediately by the team it supports. Athletics Friends Group events and programs (such as fundraising dinners, alumni days, on-the-road gatherings, mentoring, and networking nights) offer invaluable opportunities to support the Princeton Athletics community. Campus Recreation Sport Clubs also have Athletics Friends Groups. To learn more about the Sport Clubs at Princeton, please visit campusrec.princeton.edu/sport-clubs.
