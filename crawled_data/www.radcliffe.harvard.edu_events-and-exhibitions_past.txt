Taking these histories as a starting point, this conference will consider how institutions can pursue sustained and meaningful repair.

This exhibition, drawn from the Schlesinger’s collections, presents a diversity of candidates and the struggles that they continue to face in the press, on the campaign trail, and once in office. Nevertheless, they persist. Registration open Date & Time Monday, October 18, 2021 through Friday, March 18, 2022 Location The Lia and William Poorvu Gallery, Schlesinger Library 3 James Street Cambridge, MA 02138 20 Sep 2021 18 Dec 2021 Brown II Exhibition Tomashi Jackson combines a practice based in painting and printmaking with archival research in the histories of law, urbanism, and social justice. Her work plumbs the intersections between the formal languages of visual art (color, composition, layering) and the political languages driving the histories of segregation, voting rights, education, and housing in the United States. By activating these shared motifs of art and policy, her work brings the full power of both traditions to bear on historical engagement and critical action. Date & Time Monday, September 20, 2021 through Saturday, December 18, 2021 Location Johnson-Kulukundis Family Gallery, Byerly Hall 8 Garden Street Cambridge, MA 02138 21 Sep 2020 16 Jan 2021 Accompanied: The Artworks of Marilyn Pappas and Jill Slosburg-Ackerman Exhibition The virtual exhibition Accompanied: The Artworks of Marilyn Pappas and Jill Slosburg-Ackerman presents a pair of artists whose work was transformed by an abiding friendship. Pappas and Slosburg-Ackerman, both fellows at Radcliffe’s Bunting Institute in the 1980s, have sustained a conversation over four decades about artistic endeavor, studio practice, and pedagogy. The artists were members of the founding group of the Brickbottom Artists Building—one of the country’s first artist-developed live-work buildings—and are professors emeriti at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design. They have continued to work in adjoining studios for more than 30 years and have taught generations of artists.

Date & Time Thursday, January 30, 2020 through Saturday, March 28, 2020 Location Johnson-Kulukundis Family Gallery, Byerly Hall 8 Garden Street Cambridge, MA 02138 04 Nov 2019 18 Jan 2020 Dario Robleto: Unknown and Solitary Seas Exhibition Date & Time Monday, November 4, 2019 through Saturday, January 18, 2020 Location Johnson-Kulukundis Family Gallery, Byerly Hall 8 Garden Street Cambridge, MA 02138 20 Sep 2019 09 Mar 2020 Angela Davis: Freed by the People Exhibition No single person sits more squarely at the intersection of transnational struggles for freedom than the controversial political activist and pioneering philosopher Angela Yvonne Davis. Her arrest, incarceration, and trial formed one of the most widely debated legal cases in world history. Because she sparked worldwide movements that changed the 20th century, Davis was “freed by the people” well before her trial came to an end. Date & Time Friday, September 20, 2019 through Monday, March 9, 2020 Location The Lia and William Poorvu Gallery, Schlesinger Library 3 James Street Cambridge, MA 02138 03 May 2019 23 Feb 2021 Pine in the Sand Exhibition Pine in the Sand tells a story about unpredictable change while highlighting the often overlooked maintenance and infrastructure enlisted to preserve and stabilize the environment. Date & Time Friday, May 3, 2019 through Tuesday, February 23, 2021 Location Radcliffe Yard 10 Garden Street Cambridge, MA 02138 27 Mar 2019 29 Jun 2019 Willie Cole: Beauties Exhibition Willie Cole’s Beauties are haunting, full-scale prints made from crushed and hammered ironing boards, each named after a woman from the artist’s family and cultural history. Cole has used irons and ironing as central motifs in his work for 30 years, evoking everything from African masks to slave ship diagrams to the routines of domestic servitude. In this special installation, the gallery will be lined wall to wall with the Beauties. Standing silent—like sentinels, tombstones, shrouds, or windows—the prints will open a space for confronting anew the whole range of often contradictory energies running through them: resistance and oppression, beauty and violence, labor and forbearance. Date & Time Wednesday, March 27, 2019 through Saturday, June 29, 2019 Location Johnson-Kulukundis Family Gallery, Byerly Hall 8 Garden Street Cambridge, MA 02138 31 Jan 2019 16 Mar 2019 Clarissa Tossin: Future Fossil Exhibition Clarissa Tossin RI ’18 expands on her fellowship project with a newly commissioned exhibition that considers the ecology of an uncertain future. Inspired by Octavia E. Butler’s science fiction trilogy Xenogenesis (1989), in which the Amazon becomes the site for a new civilization of alien-human hybrids, Tossin speculates on a postapocalyptic world following ecological collapse. Pairing DIY plastic recycling techniques with the materials and practices of Amazonian aesthetic traditions, she highlights the contemporary footprint left in the geological sedimentation of the earth. These new works consider indigenous knowledge in relationship to the environment while also resembling ruins of a world yet to come. Date & Time Thursday, January 31, 2019 through Saturday, March 16, 2019 Location Johnson-Kulukundis Family Gallery, Byerly Hall 8 Garden Street Cambridge, MA 02138 09 Nov 2018 19 Jan 2019 Anna Von Mertens: Measure Exhibition Anna Von Mertens uses the structures of quilting and drawing to examine the frontiers of human understanding. In this exhibition, commissioned for the Harvard Radcliffe Institute, Von Mertens explores the life and work of Henrietta Leavitt, one of the women “computers” hired a century ago to study glass-plate astronomical photographs at the Harvard College Observatory. Leavitt searched for patterns among these glassy stars, and her findings provided a unit of measurement for galactic distances and led to our current understanding of the shape of the cosmos. Von Mertens’s meticulous stitches and intricate graphite marks reimagine Leavitt’s patient work, exploring the potency of single, measured actions as units of understanding. Date & Time Friday, November 9, 2018 through Saturday, January 19, 2019 Location Johnson-Kulukundis Family Gallery, Byerly Hall 8 Garden Street Cambridge, MA 02138 26 Mar 2018 21 Apr 2018 Bouchra Khalili: Foreign Office Exhibition The Radcliffe Institute presents a solo exhibition featuring a selection of elements of Bouchra Khalili’s work from Foreign Office, consisting of a digital film of the same title, a group of photographs, and a silkscreen print, titled The Archipelago. The exhibition’s combination of artistic elements suggests an alternative historiography of utopian movements—working in concert, they invite reflection on potential gestures of resistance for the present and the future. Date & Time Monday, March 26, 2018 through Saturday, April 21, 2018 Location Johnson-Kulukundis Family Gallery, Byerly Hall 8 Garden Street Cambridge, MA 02138 15 Nov 2017 20 Jan 2018 Jennifer Bornstein: Feminist Archaeology Exhibition Feminist Archaeology, an exhibition created by Jennifer Bornstein RI ’15, is an interdisciplinary art project consisting of an original video projection with accompanying prints and sculptures. The exhibition explores various strains of feminism that the artist has experienced both personally and through her research and that have been somewhat at odds with one another over time. Date & Time Wednesday, November 15, 2017 through Saturday, January 20, 2018 Location Johnson-Kulukundis Family Gallery, Byerly Hall 8 Garden Street Cambridge, MA 02138 02 Oct 2017 19 Jan 2018 Altered Gazes Exhibition Altered Gazes foregrounds women as creators and consumers of countercultural content.

Title IX at 45 Exhibition Over the past four decades, the phrase “Title IX” has become practically synonymous with women’s sports. The events leading up to Title IX’s passage in 1972 and the struggle ever since to figure out how to implement the law fairly demonstrate how athletics became part of the broader political and cultural struggles of contemporary American life.

Smoke rises vertically. Exhibition Working with vibrating walls, a livestreaming weather report, and architectural models from schools for the blind, this exhibition explores sensory experience through differing modes of perception. The artist Wendy Jacob challenges the viewer to place touch on an equal footing with sight. The title comes from the Beaufort Wind Scale, which relates wind speed to observed conditions at sea or on land.

There won’t be. Sorry. I’m not fancy. I’d rather get on my knees and talk with children I’d rather talk to strangers whose language sometimes I can’t understand I’d rather sense people, little and not so little, beyond language I’d rather share the beauty of silence between two souls I’d rather protect the sensuality and the precious way children improvise the world I’d rather spend time building a shack with a four-year-old than socialize I’d rather, you’d rather, we’d rather. . . In here, I’ll gently ask you to take your shoes off, and if you got holes in your socks, who cares, I do very often. And when you take your shoes off, try to also take your armor off—for here, you can roll on the carpet, lay on the bed, draw on the walls, hide in the closet, sit in silence, gaze into the joy, the sadness, the way children are in and out of the world they live in, with and without us. —Valérie Massadian Date & Time Thursday, March 24, 2016 through Saturday, April 16, 2016 Location Johnson-Kulukundis Family Gallery, Byerly Hall 8 Garden Street Cambridge, MA 02138 29 Feb 2016 17 Jun 2016 “A Language to Hear Myself”: Feminist Poets Speak Exhibition “A Language to Hear Myself”: Feminist Poets Speak celebrates the ways that feminist poets fashioned words and ideas into a powerful form of personal and political expression.
