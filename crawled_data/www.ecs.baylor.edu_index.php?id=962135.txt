We are proud to send young men and women like you into graduate programs and industry positions around the globe. As you near the end of your undergraduate career at Baylor, we want to provide you with the information you need to receive your diploma and/or participate in Baylor's commencement activities. It is critical that you check your e-mail daily and respond promptly when you receive graduation-related communication. Filing for Graduation All seniors in the School of Engineering & Computer Science will file for graduation with their academic advisor during their final advising appointment. You will submit an “Intent to Graduate" form during this appointment to verify your major, minor(s), concentration(s), graduation year, and the way your name will appear on your diploma. Additional questions can be directed to Ida Jamshidi. Certification A student's degree will be certified shortly following the Commencement ceremony, as long as all degree requirements were successfully completed. (Participation in the ceremony is not required.) Each student is responsible for ensuring that his or her degree audit shows all requirements complete. Students who do not complete degree requirements may still be eligible to participate in the Commencement ceremony, in accordance with the Non-certified Commencement Participation Policy.
