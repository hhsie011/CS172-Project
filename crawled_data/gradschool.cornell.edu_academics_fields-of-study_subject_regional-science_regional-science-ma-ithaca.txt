Students master techniques of analysis of urban-regional systems as they relate to public and private decision making, with heavy emphasis on mathematical models and quantitative methods. Students are fully exposed to the existing and newly developing social science theory that directly relates to the multidisciplinary approach of regional science. Course offerings focus on the socioeconomic aspects of the physical environment and on the spatial and conflict aspects of socioeconomic systems. Students may ask any member of the Graduate Faculty to serve on their Special Committee. The chairperson must be a member of the Field of Regional Science. Applicants to the master's degree program who have appropriate and strong background in quantitative methods and economics may, with a very focused program of study, be able to complete their course work in the minimum two semesters. Applicants lacking this background, or those seeking a more broadly based education in regional science, should expect to spend up to four semesters in residence for the master's degree.

Applicants are expected to have substantial preparation prior to entrance, which may be supplemented by work at Cornell. all Graduate School Requirements two recommendations GRE general test is optional for 2021 admission TOEFL or IELTS English proficiency test Learning Outcomes Cornell’s graduate programs in Regional Science are intended to help students synthesize knowledge from different cognate areas, make plausible inferences about phenomena they study, and exploit course-based knowledge to address problems at the frontiers of the field. Graduate training in Regional Science should prepare students to be professional applied social scientists. Hence, as part of their graduate training, students in Regional Science should become skilled at communicating in writing, orally, and with presentation media at a professionally acceptable level and they should be made aware of ethical issues associated with the responsible conduct of research and service to the field. In terms of substantive content, students are expected to gain a command of leading theories of micro- and macro-economic behavior, industrial location, the spatial aggregation and fragmentation of activities, trade, transportation, land use, and migration. They are also expected to have mastery of methods for modeling behaviors in space and their impacts and to frame and test theoretical propositions appropriately. Such methods include but are not limited to mathematical economics, operations research, network analysis, econometrics, spatial statistics, geographical informatics, remote sensing, input-output analysis, social accounting, computable general equilibrium analysis, and agent-based modeling techniques. Proficiencies in theoretical and applied knowledge are demonstrated through the presentation and publication of original contributions in suitable venues, active pursuit of an advanced scholarly research agenda, and ethical comportment in giving and receiving feedback on scholarship and in service to the broader community.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
