Brown University's Department of Theatre Arts and Performance Studies is internationally recognized for the quality of its faculty and instruction. Trinity Rep, with its deep tradition of resident artists, provides powerful artistic assets and creates a firm foundation of real-world experience. Together, the two organizations have produced a model of theatre training that is rigorous and technically demanding, without intellectual or creative limitations. Brown/Trinity includes the MFA programs in Acting and Directing. Students in each of the disciplines have many opportunities to study and work with fellow students from other areas, including the MFA Playwrighting students and the PhD students in Brown's Department of Theatre Arts and Performance Studies. Through directly experiencing the techniques and processes involved in each discipline, students are encouraged to become true collaborators, and to break down the often artificial barriers that have traditionally separated actors, directors, and playwrights. The primary focus in the acting training is in developing technically skilled, versatile actors capable of working in the variety of styles demanded by contemporary theatre. Directors are given the opportunity to develop their own vision, working in collaboration with actors, creating new work and rediscovering existing texts. The MFA curriculum provides a rigorous training program taught by a resident faculty, supplemented by guest artists from the professional and academic arenas.
