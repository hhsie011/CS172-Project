These run from roughly 30-90 seconds in duration. They seem to mostly be recordings of Abzug or others discussing recent news items to be played for her telephone hotline. There are often multiple tapes within each item. These multiples generally have the same content, but they're not exact duplicates, they're probably multiple takes or different versions. As a result, we've kept all of the files. There are also a number of tapes that could only be partially transferred, so the files are just a short fragment of the original.
