On October 22, 1963, at least 224,770 students boycotted the Chicago Public Schools and 10,000 people marched on City Hall. In this presentation, we will examine the factors contributing to the school boycott movement, what happened on the days of the boycott, the response from Mayor Richard J. Daley, and social and political outcomes. To conclude, we will discuss the boycott’s historical legacy. Was it “a pivotal moment in the movement for racial and social justice in this country” as community organizer Jay Travis claimed or was it “useless and ineffective in forcing change” as Chicago historians Anderson and Pickering concluded?
