Bollinger to provide a forum for faculty and students to rethink and reconceptualize the ways in which the University confronts the challenges stemming from globalization. The establishment of CGT evolved from the recommendations of the Task Force on the University and Globalization, chaired by Bollinger, which drew from a wide membership from within the University. Since its inception, membership of CGT has expanded from six founding members to over thirty, who are appointed by President Bollinger. Professor Joseph E. Stiglitz served as Chair from 2006 to 2010. Professor Saskia Sassen was named Co-chair with Professor Stiglitz in Fall 2010, and then served as Chair from 2013 to 2015. Professor Carol Gluck served as Committee Chair from 2015 to 2020. Professor Vishakha N. Desai was appointed Committee Chair in 2020. Members of the Committee come from diverse backgrounds, from finance to epidemiology to East Asian history, and draw from a diverse range of the University’s schools. Their collaboration as members of the CGT affirm the importance of drawing on multiple perspectives and methodological approaches for advancing the scholarly understanding of global issues. In Spring 2013, CGT’s formal administrative home transitioned from the Office of the President to the Office of the Provost, signifying the next step in its institutionalization at the University. The Planning and Budget Subcommittee was established soon after. Comprised of nine members, one Chair and the Director, the Planning and Budget Subcommittee is charged with coordinating and facilitating program and budgeting in order to foster the committee’s contribution to intellectual innovation, institutional contribution, and global impact.
