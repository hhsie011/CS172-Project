Once selected, students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the requirements of the program and meeting all deadlines, including registration, insurance (as needed) and other requirements. Typically, a maximum of thirty (30) students are admitted into the program each semester. To be eligible for participation in the Professional Residency Program, students must be a student in good standing enrolled in the Bachelor of Architecture or Master of Architecture degrees at The University of Texas School of Architecture during the application semester and while on Residency, and: UNDERGRADUATE Have successfully completed at least one Advanced Architectural Design Studio before the start of Residency (ARC 561R); Need one Advanced Architectural Design Studio (ARC 561R) remaining to be completed at the School of Architecture after returning from a program session; Have a 3.0 grade point average in all course work. If the student participated in a study abroad program (semester-long), there is an additional minimum of 3.5 GPA in studio courses; Must be on campus during the application semester. Students cannot apply while away on a Study Abroad Program; Have no incomplete grades or other deficiencies at the point of application; Be cleared to participate by Student Conduct and Academic Integrity and the Office of the Dean of Students in consultation with the School of Architecture; Have a completed digital and printed portfolio; Have confirmation of acceptance after the PRP Application Review. GRADUATE Have successfully completed at least one Advanced Architectural Design Studio before the start of Residency (ARC 696); Have one Advanced Architectural Design Studio (ARC 696) remaining to be completed at the School of Architecture after returning from a program session; Have a 3.33 grade point average in all course work; Must be on campus during the application semester. Students cannot apply while away on a Study Abroad Program; Have no incomplete grades or other deficiencies at the point of application; Be cleared to participate by Student Conduct and Academic Integrity and the Office of the Dean of Students in consultation with the School of Architecture; Have a completed digital and printed portfolio; Have confirmation of acceptance after the PRP Application Review. APPLICATION PROCESS After attending an Information Session, interested students must complete an Application Form. On the form, the applicant is asked to list three firm choices. In addition, students submit a portfolio of student work (digital and printed) and the non-refundable two hundred dollar ($200.00 USD) Application Fee. Since a strong portfolio is essential to successful placement, it is recommended that students begin portfolio and image preparation early, at least the semester before the expected application. Please review the Portfolio Guide. During the application process, the PRP Administration works closely with students to develop their portfolios, assist them in selecting sponsoring firms, and then support them in making contact with the firms. Firms are often chosen by considering several criteria, which may include: (1) type of architecture (housing, public work, skyscrapers, etc.), (2) location of firm, (3) work environment and/or (4) the notoriety of the firm. In many cases students choose a firm that has a long-standing relationship with the Professional Residency Program, however, new contacts and relationships are also established every session. Final firm placements are made by the PRP Director. Prior to a student's portfolio being sent to the first firm for consideration, a three hundred dollar ($300.00 USD) Contact Fee is due. We will contact up to three firms on behalf of each student until the last class day of the application semester. Once accepted by the sponsoring firm, a PRP Agreement is signed that states the responsibilities of the student and firm. Students are expected to exemplify professional standards as well as meet the particular expectations of sponsoring firm, such as, dress code, punctuality, and confidentiality. In addition, students are expected to adhere to all standards and regulations contained in The University of Texas at Austin General Information Catalog. Prior conduct or disciplinary history with the Office of the Dean of Students or the School of Architecture may make a student ineligible to participate in the Professional Residency Program. The School of Architecture reserves the right to deny participation. Acceptance is provisionary until the student has been cleared by Student Conduct and Academic Integrity and the Office of the Dean of Students. This applies to both disciplinary and academic dishonesty rulings. In some cases, students are not able to find a placement by the last day of class of the application semester or after the PRP Administration contacts three firms. When this happens there are two options: (1) students may withdraw from the program and the Contact Fee ($300.00 USD) will be reimbursed; or (2) students may wait until the next session and reapply to the program adhering to all application requirements and deadlines. Note: All checks should be made payable to "The University of Texas at Austin" and submitted to the receptionist at GOL 2.308 who will issue a receipt. Please make a digital copy of the receipts. INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS International Students need to be authorized for employment by the International Office prior to beginning the internship.
