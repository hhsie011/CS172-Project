CARES Act Frequently Asked Questions What is the CARES Act? The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is federal legislation that provides a variety of financial support to individuals and organizations affected by the COVID-19 (novel coronavirus) pandemic. The CARES Act includes a Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) that provides more than $14 billion in emergency funding to higher education. Of those funds, more than $6 billion must go directly to students in the form of emergency financial aid grants (HEERF-student share) for expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to the COVID-19 crisis. Texas Tech University will receive funds that will be provided directly to students for their expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to coronavirus, such as food, housing, course materials, technology, health care, and child-care. The other half may be used by the university to cover costs associated with significant changes to the delivery of instruction due to the coronavirus. How much will I receive? We are committed to assisting all eligible students that may have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic to the greatest extent possible with the CARES Act funds available. The actual amount each student will receive is based on the number of applications received and the funds available. How will I receive this money? Students will receive direct payment by check or direct deposit. To expedite your request, please enroll in direct deposit. Te set up direct deposit, visit Raiderlink (raiderlink.ttu.edu) and go to My Direct Deposit to receive funds electronically (ACH) instead of check by mail. Students must have an active local or mailing address in the TTU system for any refund (ACH or check) to be issued. It is the student's responsibility to maintain a correct active address with TTU to ensure receipt of payment from TTU. Do I need to repay the money? No, you will not need to repay any money received through this fund. Can I apply for funding more than once? You may fill out the application for the 2020 spring semester only once. New grant applications can be submitted in June and July for expenses related to Summer I and II. Does this funding affect my other financial aid? No. This is an emergency grant to help you manage unexpected expenses related to the coronavirus, and it will not have any impact on other financial aid you may be eligible to receive. What if I still have an account balance? Any CARES Act funding awarded to you will be paid to you directly, and it will not cover any outstanding balances owed to TTU. Any outstanding balance owed to TTU will remain the responsibility of the student. Are the Emergency Grants taxable? No. The IRS has confirmed that the payments are not taxable.
