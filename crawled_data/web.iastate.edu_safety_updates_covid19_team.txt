Faculty and staff may call the Response Team central number to request assistance, report a problem, or share an idea of a creative, innovative approach to a recent challenge. The Response Teams coordinate closely with the Emergency Operations Center and Moving Forward Executive Committee and supplement the existing response structures of Facilities Planning and Management, Department of Public Safety, Information Technology Services, and other service units.
