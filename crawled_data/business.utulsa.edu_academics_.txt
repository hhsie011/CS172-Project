Academic Approach In our business programs, we emphasize teamwork and technology, and we help our students develop expertise in a wide range of business software applications. An international perspective is blended throughout the curriculum, preparing students to conduct business wherever their career takes them. Technology is essential in business today. We give each student numerous opportunities for hands-on experience with the latest business software and technology. Students have access to three computer labs in addition to multimedia classrooms for use in student team meetings, presentations and projects.With low student-to-faculty ratios and classes taught by full-time college faculty, our environment encourages personal success. Through additional unique classroom experiences, valuable internships and community service business projects, our students receive a well-rounded education, which prepares them to meet the challenges of a changing world. 800 S.
