On Monday, Texas Tech launched a campus COVID-19 reporting dashboard. This dashboard will provide the total number of active cases of COVID-19 and a breakdown of positive cases amongst students and faculty/staff. Through this dashboard, you will also find information regarding the self-reporting procedures if you receive a positive diagnosis. The University has created an app that acts as a symptom checker for faculty, staff and students. This will give each person the ability to daily self-report, with an option for instructors or supervisors to receive feedback when someone is not feeling well. We are in the final stages of integrating the app with other resources and areas. We look forward to sharing this new technology with you soon. Finally, we are offering free COVID-19 testing through August 24th for all faculty, staff, and students at a drive-thru location at the Texas Tech University Museum. This clinic is being organized by the Texas Department of Emergency Management and pre-registration is required. Through the pre-registration link, you can sign up for a testing time in one-week increments, with dates and times coming online each Saturday for the upcoming week. Your health and safety are important, and we encourage you to review the updated health and safety information provided through the Texas Tech Commitment. If you have a COVID-19 related question, you are encouraged to call 806-742-5929 or email covid19@ttu.edu.
