During the semester, please submit lists and materials at least two weeks before the readings are assigned. Course Reserves requests are processed in the order they are received. Submitting all lists and materials at once is very helpful in terms of making materials available in a timely manner. Where to submit Course Reserves lists Faculty can request items be placed on Course Reserves in person or by using the online request form. To identity which library handles your course reserves, please select from the dropdown list provided above. Questions can be directed to the Reserves Supervisor at the library where you submit your list. How to re-activate Reserves lists from previous semesters The libraries will reactivate the linked items on reading lists, but will not reactivate scanned materials. Any print reserves, as well as ebooks and electronic journal articles will be reactivated when you submit your reactivation request. If we do not have licensed content to link to, we will notify you so that you can decide whether or not to scan the materials for upload into the University's course management systems. Please review the list via your CourseWorks page, and using the online request form, submit a re-activation request. Please note: Course Reserves lists are not re-activated automatically. How to submit materials to Course Reserves You may deposit your course pack or personal copies of books directly to the appropriate reserves desk between the hours of 9 AM and 5 PM Monday through Friday. Submitting all materials at once is very helpful in terms of making materials available in a timely manner. For more information on particular Course Reserves material types: books course packs films Restrictions on Course Reserves materials Course Reserves requests must be in compliance with the United States Copyright Act of 1976, Section 107. Please consult the Columbia University Libraries Copyright Policy for full guidelines. Questions can be directed to the Reserves Supervisor at the library location handling your Course Reserves list. The libraries place on reserves only items that are required reading; recommended readings should not be requested for reserves. Textbooks will not be purchased for reserves use by some library locations - check with the Reserves Supervisor at the library where your list is processed. Most reserves units will accept up to 25 items per list. Contact the reserves unit at the library where you submit your list for specific limits. Bound journals, reference materials and Butler Media Center materials will not be placed on reserves.
