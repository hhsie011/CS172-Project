WHAT IS CHICANA AND CHICANO STUDIES? Chicana and Chicano Studies was born out of the student movements of the 1960s and 1970s and created as a space where scholars could see themselves represented in the curriculum and amongst the faculty. As an interdisciplinary field, the discipline draws from history, art, literature, education, sociology, theory, and many more, to examine Chicana/o and Latina/o histories, contributions, and experiences. Through Chicana and Chicano Studies, our goal is to expand critical thinking, communication, and civic-mindedness through an engaging and interdisciplinary curriculum focusing on the arts, humanities, and social sciences. We prepare our scholars for future academic and employment endeavors to be successful leaders in their communities. "A major benefit of joining the Chicana/o Studies Department is that you are welcomed into a family. For many first time college students, a four-year university becomes a strange place to navigate without guidance. For me, the Chicana/o Studies Department became a place I felt at home and a place where many mentors guided me towards the right direction." - Jose Macias, Class of 2011 "Chicana/o Studies expanded my critical reading, critical thinking, and critical writing skills through its amazing interdisciplinary program. As a double major, Child and Adolescent Studies and Chicana/o Studies, this program has provided me great insight and an edge in my career as a future teacher. Rooted in social justice this program has inspired me to be a teacher who is committed to serving her students, their families, and community." - Alma Lorenzo, Class of 2014 WHY MAJOR IN CHICANA AND CHICANO STUDIES?
