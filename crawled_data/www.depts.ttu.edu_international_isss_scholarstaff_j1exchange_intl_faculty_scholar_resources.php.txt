The certification that a translation is accurate, in most cases, can be done by anyone who speaks both languages. In some cases, in order to be sure a document is accurate, the entity that requires the translated document may require that a professional translator or translating service be utilized. These companies can be found easily through a search on the internet. Note: Most US government agencies, including the Department of State and the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, do not require that a translation be done by a professional translator or translating service. While it is not required, you may chose to have a translation notarized. However, you must understand that a notary can only acknowledge/notarize a statement by the translator that he/she has accurately translated a document from the original language into English. A notary cannot/does not confirm that the translation is accurate. Faculty at TTU that speak other languages English Classes Lubbock literacy, a community program, provides free English as a Second Language (ESL) classes for international students, scholars, and their dependents.
