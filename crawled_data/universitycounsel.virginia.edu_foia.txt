A public record is any writing or recording — regardless of whether it is a paper record, an electronic file, an audio or video recording or any other format — that is prepared or owned by, or in the possession of a public body or its officers, employees, or agents in the transaction of public business. Va. Code § 2.2-3701. All public records are presumed to be open and may be withheld only if a statutory exemption applies. The purpose of FOIA is to promote an increased awareness by all persons of governmental activities. FOIA requires the law to be interpreted liberally, in favor of access, and that any exemption from public access must be interpreted narrowly.
