The faculty at Baylor are instrumental in providing an encouraging and challenging learning environment where a Christian perspective is integrated into the students’ field of study. Baylor provides a solid academic foundation and supportive research and discovery platform for students to pursue intellectual challenges within a framework of Christian faith. It is a privilege to help lead and support faculty who are caring, compassionate and desire to explore new learning to better the world around them. Faculty/Staff Faculty Directory W.
