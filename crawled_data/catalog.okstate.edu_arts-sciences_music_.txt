Michael and Anne Greenwood School of Music at OSU serves students who plan careers in the field of music as well as those who desire to participate in any element of a comprehensive music program. Professional instruction prepares students for careers in performance, teaching, and the music industry. The OSU undergraduate degrees are also excellent preparation for graduate school and for careers in arts management, recording technology, music composition and arranging, church music, and music academia, among other paths. Students planning to major in music at the university level should have a strong interest in music and/or a talent for performance in vocal or instrumental music. Individual lessons, fundamental theory knowledge, and basic piano ability also supports success at the university level. The music major may choose from the following degrees: Bachelor of Music (BM) in performance, BM in instrumental or vocal music education, Bachelor of Arts (BA) in music, and Bachelor of Science (BS) in music industry. The student majoring in a discipline other than music may participate with music majors in all ensembles (choirs, opera, orchestra, concert bands, marching band, basketball band, jazz bands, popular and new music ensembles, and chamber ensembles) and courses, as well as individual lessons for academic credit. Students may also pursue a minor in music. The Greenwood School of Music offers a music minor, jazz minor, and music theory/composition minor. An active scholarship program provides assistance to music majors and non-music majors. Students are invited to write, call 405.744.8997, or visit our website (music.okstate.edu) for audition information. Faculty members, students, and ensembles present over 150 concerts and recitals annually. The school also supports a robust program of extension and outreach opportunities. The Michael and Anne Greenwood School of Music is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music and is an All-Steinway School. Admission Requirements Students wishing to major in music should contact the Michael and Anne Greenwood School of Music to arrange for an entrance audition and interview. Students are expected to maintain an overall GPA of at least 2.0 while enrolled as music majors at OSU. Any student whose GPA falls below 2.0 will be placed on departmental probation. To be removed from departmental probation, students must increase the overall GPA to at least 2.0. Any student who fails to meet the minimum GPA requirement in two consecutive semesters will be suspended from the OSU music program. For the purpose of determining probationary status, the number of ensemble credits that apply toward the GPA cannot exceed the total number of ensemble credits required for completion of the degree. Though a student must maintain an overall GPA of at least 2.0 in order to avoid departmental probation from semester to semester, all music students must have a minimum GPA of at least 2.5 in the required major courses in order to graduate. In addition to maintaining a 2.0 overall GPA, students must earn grades no lower than a C in any music class. Students who fail to pass a required music course with a grade of at least a C after two attempts will be suspended from the music major. Applied Juries Students are expected to pass a performance jury at the conclusion of each semester of applied study. Any students who fail to pass this jury will be placed on departmental probation. Students must also pass an upper-division barrier jury prior to enrolling in upper-division applied lessons if required by the degree program. Any students who do not pass this jury will be placed on departmental probation. Those students must retake this performance barrier jury at the conclusion of the following semester. Any students who fail a performance barrier jury for two consecutive semesters will be suspended from the music program. Any student suspended from the music program may re-audition for acceptance into the program but must wait at least one year before continuing as a music major. Students who are initially suspended from the music program but are later accepted after the re-audition process will remain on probationary status for one semester. Any re-admitted student who does not meet all of the necessary minimum requirements at the conclusion of their first semester of re-admittance will be suspended from the program. Further details of the departmental academic progress policy are published in the Undergraduate Music Student Handbook at music.okstate.edu.

For the student pursuing the conducting option, we stress challenging studies in conducting skills, repertoire and rehearsal techniques. Degree candidates will focus on their particular area of specialty and will have numerous opportunities to conduct appropriate choirs, wind bands, orchestras and string groups, and chamber ensembles. As a part of specializing on their instruments, students who choose the applied music option will develop a refined knowledge of the literature composed for that instrument and will also learn the teaching and technical approaches that have been developed for that musical medium. Performing opportunities, both solo and collaborative, are an important component of the degree candidate's studies. The Master of Music is a 32-hour degree. Each option includes courses in music research and bibliography, music theory, and music history. Elective credits that are built into each degree option permit the student to explore additional interests. Each degree candidate will complete a final project designed in collaboration with their primary professor. A final oral examination is also part of the degree requirements. Admission Requirements Prospective students must have earned a bachelor's degree or the equivalent. Students interested in the conducting option must audition on campus, or submit a video recording of their conducting. Students interested in the applied music option must audition on campus or submit an audio or video recording of a recent performance (minimum of 20 minutes of music). Financial Assistance The Michael and Anne Greenwood School of Music offers a variety of assistantships with areas of specialization including music appreciation, class piano, instrumental techniques, accompanying, conducting, and music technology, among others.
