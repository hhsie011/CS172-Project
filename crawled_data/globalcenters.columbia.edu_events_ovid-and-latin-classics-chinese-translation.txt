This week-long colloquium features a collaborative project that will bring together scholars from China, the United States, and Europe to strategize about certain shared research goals in the areas of Greco-Roman classical study, modern translation theory and practice, and cross-cultural analysis of the psychology of exilic experience. In 2017, as a part of the National Social Science Fund of China "the Ovid in Chinese Project", an international conference entitled Globalizing Ovid, took place at Shanghai Normal University, attracting more than 60 scholars from across the globe. This colloquium in Beijing aims to build on the Shanghai conference in 2017, and also on the strong relationship that personnel from Columbia and Dickinson College have already established with key players in the Chinese translation project. The symposium will be open to the public on May 20, 21, 23, and 24. Agenda Notice The event will be in Chinese and English.
