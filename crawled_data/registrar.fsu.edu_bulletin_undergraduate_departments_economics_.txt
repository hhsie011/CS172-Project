The program strives to make undergraduates aware of the critical issues in economic science and policy, to provide them with a basic understanding of the tools needed to analyze those issues, and to prepare them for academic or professional opportunities beyond the baccalaureate degree. The Department of Economics cooperates in the following interdivisional programs: international affairs, the interdisciplinary program in social science, Asian studies, Russian and East European studies, African American studies, demography, financial mathematics, public health, and social science education. Computer Skills Competency All undergraduates at Florida State University must demonstrate basic computer skills competency prior to graduation. As necessary computer competency skills vary from discipline to discipline, each major determines the courses needed to satisfy this requirement. Undergraduate majors in economics satisfy this requirement by earning a grade of “C–” or higher in ECO 4421. State of Florida Common Program Prerequisites The state of Florida has identified common program prerequisites for this University degree program. Specific prerequisites are required for admission into the upper-division program and must be completed by the student at either a community college or a state university prior to being admitted to this program. Students may be admitted into the University without completing the prerequisites, but may not be admitted into the program. At the time this document was published, some common program prerequisites were being reviewed by the state of Florida and may have been revised. Please visit https://dlss.flvc.org/admin-tools/common-prerequisites-manuals for a current list of state-approved prerequisites. The following lists the common program prerequisites or their substitutions, necessary for admission into this upper-division degree program: Economics – Social Sciences ECO X013 and ECO X023, or ECO XXXX and ECO XXXX: two economics courses for three credit hours each Requirements Admission Admission to the undergraduate program is based upon the availability of faculty and space and upon academic performance. Students with fifty-two or more acceptable semester hours, both ECO 2013 and 2023 completed with a grade of “C” (2.0) or better, an overall GPA of 2.5 or better on all attempted coursework at the college level, and in good standing with the University will receive priority consideration but are not guaranteed admission to the program. Upper-division transfer students are evaluated for formal admission to the major after completing their first semester at FSU as a full-time student. All students must meet “mapping” requirements to be admitted to and remain in the upper-division major. Consult https://www.academic-guide.fsu.edu/ for more information. Major in Economics Beyond ECO 2013 and ECO 2023, the economics major requires ECO 3101, 3203, 3431, 4421 and an additional fifteen semester hours of upper-division economics electives. Majors must complete the supporting courses: STA 2023, 2122, or 4321 (choose one); and MAC 1105, 1140, 2233, or 2311 (choose one). Pre-calculus algebra (MAC 1140) is recommended, and calculus is recommended for students contemplating graduate study in economics. A total of three economics internship (ECO 4941) hours and six honors thesis (ECO 4934) hours may count toward elective requirements for the economics major. Students must maintain an overall average grade of “C” in economics and supporting courses. Majors will not receive credit toward the major requirements for economics courses in which a grade of less than “C–” has been earned. A minimum of eighteen semester hours in economics must be taken at Florida State University. No more than twelve hours of upper-division economics transfer credit will be accepted toward major requirements by the department. Transfer credit intended to satisfy major requirements is subject to the approval of the Undergraduate Director for Economics. If more than six years has elapsed between the last active term of enrollment at FSU and the term of readmission, students seeking readmission to FSU will be subject to the economics major requirements in effect at the time of readmission. A student majoring in economics must complete the minor requirements specified by a supporting academic department. Recommended minors include business, business analytics, entrepreneurship, mathematics, statistics, computer science, history, psychology, and any of the minors available in the College of Social Sciences. In accordance with University mapping milestones, undergraduate students who intend to major in economics should take ECO 2013, 2023, and the supporting courses in mathematics and statistics before completing liberal studies. The principles courses (ECO 2013, 2023) may be taken in either order. The department allows students to take the courses in the same semester, but neither recommends nor encourages it. Academic Performance No required course in which a student has earned a grade below “C–” may be applied toward any of the degrees in economics. Students must also make a “C” or better in ECO 2013 and ECO 2023. A student who has received more than two unsatisfactory grades (U, F, D–, D, D+) in the following courses will not be permitted to graduate with a degree offered by the Department of Economics: ECO 2013, MAC 1105, MAC 1114, MAC 1140, MAC 2311, MAC 2233, STA 2023, STA 2122, STA 4321. This rule applies whether these courses are taken at Florida State University or elsewhere, and it includes repeated unsatisfactory grades in the same course. A student who has received more than four unsatisfactory grades (U, F, D–, D, D+) total in economics or mathematics or statistics courses (and their prerequisites) required for any major offered by the Department of Economics, taken at Florida State University or elsewhere, including repeated unsatisfactory grades in the same required course, will not be permitted to graduate with a degree in that major. Degrees Majors in economics may be awarded either the Bachelor of Science (BS) or the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree upon completion of all University requirements for those degrees. Honors in the Major Honors-only sections of ECO 2013 and ECO 2023 are offered each Fall and Spring for lower-division Honors students. The Department of Economics offers honors in the major to encourage talented juniors and seniors to undertake independent and original research as part of the undergraduate experience. For requirements and other information, see the “University Honors Office and Honor Societies” chapter of this General Bulletin. Minor in Economics A minor requires fifteen semester hours in departmental courses, including ECO 2013 and 2023, each with a grade of “C” or better and at least one course selected from ECO 3101, 3203, 3431, or 4421. Students will not receive credit toward the minor for courses in which a grade less than “C–” has been earned. Economics minors must have at least a “C” (2.0) grade point average in their economics coursework. ECO 2000 will not count toward the minor. No more than six semester hours of transfer credit will be accepted toward the minor.
