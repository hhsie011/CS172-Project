Neeraj Kaushal, an economist and professor of social work, investigates the rising anxiety and common complaints, such as whether immigrants replace host-country workers and whether they are a net gain or a net drag on host countries. She finds that immigration, on balance, is beneficial to host countries and shows that today’s global mobility is historically typical; that most immigration occurs through legal frameworks; the U.S. system works quite well most of the time and its features are replicated by many countries; and proposed anti-immigrant measures are likely to cause suffering without deterring potential immigrants. 212-854-5573 [email protected] Genre Nonfiction Topic Economics Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
