The Quick Search tool creates an easy way to search across the Texas A&M University Libraries' popular resources. Search for books, journal articles, newspapers, movies, music, digital collections, and more all in one place. Quick Search allows users the ability to: See a variety of sources, such as books, movies, and articles all in a single results page Limit results in a variety of ways to get exactly what is need, including peer-reviewed journals Search across the Libraries' catalogs (LibCat and MSL), Texas A&M's OAK Trust institutional repository, and hundreds of scholarly databases like JSTOR, Academic Search Complete, and ScienceDirect Quick Search is not intended to be a comprehensive search tool, as it does not include some important databases.
