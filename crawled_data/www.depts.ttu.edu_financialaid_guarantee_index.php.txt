Eligible students must apply, be accepted for admission and have a complete financial aid file before the state priority deadline of January 15 of the academic year in which you submit your FAFSA to be considered for Red Raider Guarantee. (For example - for academic year 2022-2023, the deadline is January 15, 2022.) Students may qualify for the program for up to eight (8) semesters of full-time enrollment for incoming freshmen, and up to four (4) semesters for transfer students with an associate's degree. Red Raider Guarantee ensures tuition and mandatory fees up to 30 credit hours per year, will be paid by a combination of federal, state, and institutional funds (state and institutional for TASFA students). Examples of funds include, but are not limited to: PELL Grant, SEOG, TEXAS Grant, Texas Public Education Grant, Texas Tech Grant, scholarships (external and/or internal) etc. This guarantee is subject to change without notice based on the annual funding levels provided to the university by the federal and state education agencies.

No. Once the student files the FAFSA/TASFA, the Financial Aid Office will identify all eligible students. If I am eligible for the RRG, will I continue to receive the RRG for the remaining semesters? The Financial Aid Office will identify all eligible recipients. Eligible recipients need only complete the FAFSA/TASFA for each academic year and meet program guidelines Do courses taken in high school or CLEP courses affect my eligibility for RRG? No. Credits taken as a non-regular college student will not count against the first-time student designation. Are there academic requirements to remain eligible for RRG? Yes. Students must meet the institution's satisfactory academic progress (SAP) requirements. The SAP requirements are the same for most other financial aid programs (excluding TEXAS Grant and B-On Time Loan). Is the RRG available to dependent and independent students? RRG is based on eligibility not on dependency status.
