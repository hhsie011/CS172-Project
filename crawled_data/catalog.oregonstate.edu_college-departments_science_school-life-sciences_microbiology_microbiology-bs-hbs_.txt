The undergraduate BS degree in Microbiology (MB) is designed for students seeking a focused education in the field of microbiology. The major consists of a comprehensive core with a strong biological and physical science foundation combined with select fundamental courses in microbiology, followed by the completion of a number of upper division microbiology courses selected by each student based on their specific interests. The Microbiology major integrates a number of laboratory classes, providing students with a wide variety of hands-on experiences. Students can also choose to do microbiology research in a number of laboratories on campus. Microbiology majors receive excellent training for a variety of professional programs, such as medical, dental, and pharmacy programs, as well as graduate school. The Microbiology major has a built-in Chemistry minor. Students may also elect to complete one transcript-visible option in Pre-Medicine or Aquatic Microbiology. An option is not required. Options in the MB major require additional credits beyond the basic MB major, although most students can complete the MB degree requirements plus the additional course work for either option in four years. The Pre-Medicine option will help prepare a student for taking the standardized test required for medical school application (MCAT), as well as provide an additional perspective in the humanities that is valued by medical programs. The Aquatic Microbiology option takes advantage of an area of expertise by various researchers at OSU, exposing students to both fundamental concepts as well as unique perspectives related to microbiology in both freshwater and ocean systems. For more information, write to the Head of the Department of Microbiology, 226 Nash Hall, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97331-3804 or visit the departmental website for specific contact information. Major Code: 570 Apply specialized microbiology knowledge from multiple fields to critically analyze and evaluate microbiological, environmental, and health-related problems. Demonstrate competency in routine and specialized microbiological laboratory skills applicable to microbiological research or clinical methods, including laboratory safety and accurately reporting observations and analysis. Communicate scientific concepts, experimental results and analytical arguments clearly and concisely, both verbally and in writing. Practice flexible professional skills needed for careers in microbiology and related scientific and professional fields. Students majoring in Microbiology cannot seek a dual or double major in Biochemistry & Biophysics, Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, BioHealth Sciences, Biology or Zoology. To receive the BS degree in Microbiology, a student must complete all university baccalaureate core requirements plus departmental requirements listed below. All departmental requirements must be taken for a grade, with the exception of CH 324, which may be taken S/U; however, if taken S/U the student will not receive the chemistry minor. Microbiology majors planning advanced professional training in medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, etc should consult an appropriate advisor.
