The ceremony began with the traditional procession of students from each of the University's schools and colleges, followed by the academic procession of administrators, deans and other dignitaries. The ceremony featured remarks from Chancellor Kent Syverud, who praised grads for doing "wondrous things here in the most challenging of times." Student speaker Ghael Fobes Mora '22, a broadcast and digital journalism major from Newhouse, shared highlights from the past four years and emphasized that each graduate has a unique story. The Commencement address was delivered by Syracuse native David Muir (photo left), anchor and managing editor of "ABC World News Tonight with David Muir." Muir, who said he was humbled to be inside the Dome in his hometown, recalled the doors that opened in Syracuse that allowed him to begin his journalism career and encouraged graduates to find their own doors.
