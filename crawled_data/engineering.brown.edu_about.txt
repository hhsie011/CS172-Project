Sub Navigation In This Section Diversity and Inclusion Engineering Research Center Fast Facts History Mission Staff Awards About Us Brown Engineering emphasizes the power of interdisciplinary thought and recognizes that engineering is intertwined with every aspect of our lives. Our historical roots are truly interdisciplinary. The School is organized without the traditional departments or boundaries found at most schools; our model is focused on making unique connections between the various engineering disciplines. Along with our associations with the other scholarly disciplines – biology, medicine, physics, chemistry, computer science, the humanities and the social sciences – our co-operations bring unique solutions to challenging problems. The School focuses on unique and innovative clustering of faculty; in terms of research groups, engineers of all types team together with non-engineers to tackle some of the biggest problems facing engineering and science today. Our talents and expertise lie in the interdisciplinary domain where the seemingly diverse disciplines converge.
