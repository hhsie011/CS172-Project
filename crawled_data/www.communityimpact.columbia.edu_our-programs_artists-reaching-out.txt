Learn more About After-Hours Tutoring About Artists Reaching Out Artists Reaching Out (ARO) is a volunteer program that brings arts education to kids who have limited opportunities for enrichment in the arts. We serve the Morningside Heights/Harlem community, teaching art to students in pre-school through middle school. Volunteers foster positive mentoring relationships and cultivate young talent in the areas of drama, music, visual art, creative writing, and dance. In addition to our volunteer activities, ARO seeks to bring together a community of Columbia students who are passionate about education, art, and everything in between, as well as to foster awareness about diversity and inclusion in the arts, both inside and outside of the classroom. There is no need to be an artist or to have teaching experience in order to join us. Everyone is welcome!
