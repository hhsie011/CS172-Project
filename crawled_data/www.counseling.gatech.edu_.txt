GTCC Statement on Racial Injustice, Political Change, and the Global Pandemic The Counseling Center extends our empathy and support to all that are affected by recent distressing events. Threatening and violent acts, the contentious political environment, racial injustice, and the unremitting stresses of a global pandemic are deeply disturbing. We all share in the responsibility to speak out against hatred and racism and to speak for justice. Moreover, we understand the impact of social disconnection, and increased morbidity and mortality caused by the global pandemic. The Counseling Center recognizes that both the singular and cumulative effect on our students, especially BIPOC populations, can be directly and indirectly emotionally impactful and possibly traumatizing. The Counseling Center continues to stand with our students against racial injustice and foster a space of hope and healing as we work through these issues together. Managing stress related to political change (apa.org) We also encourage you to connect with your campus community and student cultural organizations for support: Organizations - Georgia Institute of Technology (campuslabs.com) Get Help Now Students experiencing a crisis that requires immediate attention may speak with a counselor at any time 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
