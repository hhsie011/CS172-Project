Load More Follow on Instagram Featured news See More News NLI Director Joins 80 Researchers Worldwide to Create Parameters for Healthy and Sustainable Cities Director of the Natural Learning Initiative Dr. Deepti Adlakha‚Äôs latest research work was published as part of The Lancet Global Health Series on Urban Design, Transport and Health. Urban design and city planning influence how we can travel, the quality of the air we breathe, our access to essential facilities and services, our participation in social events, and our enjoyment of green spaces. All this is vital to our physical and mental health. In 2016, a series of papers in The Lancet highlighted the myriad links between cities and health and proposed a set of city planning indicators. In this follow-up series published in The Lancet Global Health, authors show how the indicators can benchmark and monitor progress to guide urban policy to achieve population health and sustainability targets. They provide tools that other cities can use to replicate the indicators and explore ‚Äúwhere to next‚Äù to create healthy and sustainable cities, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change. Congratulations, Class of 2022! We asked our spring graduates for some thoughts on their time in the College of Design. Below, hear from them in their own words. A New Way To Measure: Bringing Drone Technology to Landscape Architecture With the help of NC State‚Äôs Institute for Transportation, Research and Education (ITRE), Emily McCoy, associate professor of practice in landscape architecture and environmental planning, has been flying drones across campus for the past five years. But she‚Äôs capturing more than the beauty of the landscape. McCoy and the students in her landscape performance class have been using tools such as drones with thermal cameras to evaluate how different landscapes across campus perform from a sustainability standpoint. As supporters of the New Landscape Declaration, we emphasize evidence-based inquiry and design thinking that positions students and graduates to engage with and propel the landscape architecture profession into the future as it evolves in response to environmental and societal imperatives. New Landscape Declaration Department Head of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning Meg Calkins, FASLA Email Meg Our mission is to teach, learn, research, and apply state-of-the-art practices that create innovative and resilient landscapes focused on human and ecosystem health, safety, well-being, social equity, and quality of life. We prepare the next generation of landscape architects to engage challenges and opportunities focused on: Landscape dynamics and resilient design; Community planning and design; Design for children and families; Research and evidence-based design strategies; Emerging digital design tools for representation, simulation, and evaluation. Graduate Landscape Architecture The Master of Landscape Architecture (MLA) is a STEM-designated degree and LAAB accredited program that prepares graduate students for the rigors of professional practice, research, leadership, and community engagement. Our students, faculty, and local design community seek to understand the impact of human actions on the land and to respond with community-based design strategies. We are dedicated to teaching, researching, and practicing design processes that acknowledge the interdependence of built landscapes and ecological, social, and economic systems. The department offers three main academic curriculum tracks: First Professional Masters of Landscape Architecture (Track III) First Professional Masters of Landscape Architecture, Advanced Standing (Track II) Post-Professional Degree (Track I) The first half of the academic program prepares students for the current practice and discipline of landscape architecture. It equips them with the core knowledge base, tools, processes, and skills in design, site works, history and theory, planning, research and the culture of professional practice. The second half of the academic program propels students into the profession and discipline of the future that they will help evolve and lead. It positions students to pursue substantive inquiry into their own, those of the faculty, and those of the larger extended community. Students master bodies of knowledge, pursue evidence-based research, and hone verbal, written, and graphic communication skills. Throughout their program of study, students combine critical design thinking talents with their intelligence, creativity, and passions to frame, engage and challenge the questions, problems, and situations of landscape that involve health, safety, wellbeing, and quality of life. The department also offers the following certificates and programs: Graduate Minors and Certificate Programs Graduate minors are available to all students and consist of nine credit hours of courses, in another graduate degree granting discipline, listed as 400-level or above. A member of that degree‚Äôs faculty may serve as a third member of the student‚Äôs final project committee. Certificates offered in GIS, Public Policy and Horticultural Science may be of particular interest. Please visit the Graduate Minors and Certificate Page for more information. Graduate Certificate in City Design The Graduate Certificate in City Design focuses on design at the scale of the city, and within neighborhoods and urban districts. Studios and seminars focus on the challenges, and opportunities facing communities and cities in the 21st century, with a particular emphasis upon principles of sustainability and urban ecology. Learn more Disaster Resilient Policy, Engineering and Design Certificate The imperative motivating the Graduate Certificate in Disaster Resilient Policy, Engineering and Design is to educate the next generation of practitioners and scholars to apply knowledge gained in the classroom and in the field to reduce the rise in disaster losses and assist communities to adapt to a changing climate. Learn more Inter-Institutional Study Students at NC State University may also register for courses at local universities (UNC‚ÄìChapel Hill, UNC-Greensboro, and Duke University) paying NC State University credit fees. Our students have an exceptional range of courses and programs open to them through these inter-institutional study opportunities. Students may also take courses at the other Raleigh colleges that are members of the Cooperating Raleigh Colleges organization. Please visit the Inter-Institutional Study Page for more information.

Well, kind of. Graphic design students at the College of Design partnered with @redhatinc to create solutions for a world dominated by driverless vehicles. Throughout the studio, students had to imagine a future in which the public no longer had access to personal vehicles. Then, they had to ideate how autonomous vehicles can fit into various human factors such as family needs, career specializations and security concerns.
