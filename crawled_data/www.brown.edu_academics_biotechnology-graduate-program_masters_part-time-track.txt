Students in the part-time track have the same degree (credit and thesis) requirements and receive the same degree as the full-time program. Students in the part-time option must maintain continuous enrollment in the program. Students who have selected this option have the flexibility to go between part-time (1 course and thesis) and full-time (2+ courses and thesis) to suit their circumstance. Students in the part-time track work with the Master’s Program Director and Graduate School to design a suitable course of study.
