Our current research focus spans across pattern specification, software architecture, microservice-based enterprise application design, code analysis, security assessment, model-driven analysis and testing. Faculty Involved Dr. Eunjee Song Dr. Song's research is in software engineering that covers pattern specification, model-driven engineering, model analysis and design for complex systems, and model-driven test generation. Dr. Tomas Cerny Dr. Cerny's research focuses on software engineering and cybersecurity, covering aspect-oriented software development, internet of things (IoT) security, microservice architecture design, context-aware user interface design, enterprise software development, and code analysis. Buoyed by a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF), Dr. Tomas Cerny, set up a study abroad experience unlike any past opportunity in Baylor’s School of Engineering and Computer Science: two months of engaging undergraduate computer science students in research on software testing and quality assurance in the Czech Republic’s two largest cities. Read more about the experience from the students' perspectives.
