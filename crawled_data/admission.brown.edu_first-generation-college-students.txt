First Generation College Students While Brown defines the term "first-generation college student" as a student whose parents did not complete a four-year college degree, the first-generation community at Brown is welcoming to any student who self-identifies as having had limited exposure to the college application process and the college-going experience. Our Commitment Applying to college can feel like a daunting process, especially for students who come from first-generation backgrounds. Brown is committed to empowering first-generation students with the information they need as they approach their college application process and to support them once they enroll. U-FLi Center and Other Resources Once on campus, first-generation college students are encouraged to make the most of their experience at Brown by exploring broadly through the Open Curriculum and joining any of the 400+ student organizations. The Undocumented, First-Generation College, Low-Income (U-FLi) Student Center is the main hub for members of the Brown community who identify with the undocumented, first-generation college, and/or low-income student experience to meet other students, staff, and faculty that share these aspects of their background. The U-FLi Center staff hosts events throughout the year and collaborates with staff at the Brown Center for Students of Color (BCSC), Global Center for International Students, LGBTQ Center, and Sarah Doyle Center for Women and Gender to host intersectional programs throughout the year.
