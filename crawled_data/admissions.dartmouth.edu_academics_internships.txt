Areas of Study Scholars Who Teach Academic Resources Custom Majors Flexible Study Plan Internships Research Study Around the World A Competitive Edge in Experiential Learning Timing can be everything when it comes to landing the right internship experience. At Dartmouth, our 10-week terms offer you the flexibility to pursue internships during any season of the year—giving you a significant advantage over students from schools that funnel internships into summer breaks. Networking by the Thousands We operate dozens of offices, centers, and programs that connect you to thousands of domestic and international internship opportunities in business, information technology, research, service, activism, social innovation, and public policy. Here's a sample of who's doing what on campus. Dartmouth Center for Professional Development (CPD) The CPD provides one-on-one advising, social networking platforms, and databases that connect you to countless internship opportunities including many that are exclusive to Dartmouth students. Dartmouth Alumni Career Network Tap into the expertise and connections offered by the thousands of Dartmouth alumni who actively advise students about internship, career, and graduate school opportunities. Dartmouth Center for Social Impact Enrich your education through direct service, philanthropy, social innovation, activism, and social impact research. The Rockefeller Center Prepare for a public policy leave-term internship with leadership development and search advice. The center also runs the First-Year Fellows program, an alumni-mentored public policy internship in Washington, D.C. offered during the summer after your first year at Dartmouth. The ISTS – Neukom Institute The Institute for Security, Technology, and Society (ISTS) and the Neukom Institute team up to support leave-term experiences in information technology at nonprofit organizations. The Dickey Center for International Understanding The Dickey Center supports curricular programs, internships, fellowships, co-curricular activities, and engagement with experts in support of research initiatives that promote international understanding. Global Dartmouth As part of the provost's office, Global Dartmouth supports and facilitates international research collaborations and provides travel-related resources that enable you to work with partners around the world.
