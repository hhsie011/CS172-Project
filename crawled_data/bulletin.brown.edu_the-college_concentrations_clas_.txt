An undergraduate concentration in Classics furnishes students with a broad liberal education, and provides specialized training for those students intending to enter graduate school. Students may choose to study Ancient Greek, Latin, Sanskrit, and/or Modern Greek, and to explore courses in literature, mythology, history, philosophy, and religion. Students may either pursue the standard Classics concentration – the most popular choice – or one of several optional tracks: Greek, Latin, Greek and Latin, South Asian Classics, Sanskrit, Greek and Sanskrit, or Latin and Sanskrit. Concentrators who pursue an honors degree write a senior thesis, typically over the course of two semesters during their senior year. Beginning with declarations submitted after September 1, 2018, all tracks except "Greek and Latin," "Greek and Sanskrit," and "Latin and Sanskrit" require the satisfactory completion of nine courses as described below. The introductory courses in Greek and Latin may not usually be counted toward a concentration, but those in Sanskrit may be counted toward the concentration requirement in some of the tracks. Students should always consult with the Director of Undergraduate Studies regarding their path toward fulfilling requirements and choosing electives.
