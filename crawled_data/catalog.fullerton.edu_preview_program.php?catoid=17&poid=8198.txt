Students must have a “C” (2.0) or better in all geological sciences courses applied towards the requirement; in addition, students must have a 2.0 average in required courses in related fields. Proficiency in English composition is required. Undergraduate Thesis (3 units) In this capstone experience, majors work one-on-one with a faculty adviser on a research project. Students are encouraged to begin research during their junior year or earlier. GEOL 498 satisfies the university’s upper-division writing requirement. Minimum Course Requirements for the Major GEOL 101 - Introduction to Geology (3) or GEOL 110T - Topics in Earth Science (3) or GEOL 140 - Earth’s Atmosphere and Oceans (3) GEOL 101L - Introduction to Geology Laboratory (1) GEOL 201 - Earth History (3) GEOL 303A - Earth Materials (4) GEOL 303B - Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology (4) GEOL 321 - Sedimentation and Stratigraphy (4) GEOL 335 - Hydrology and Surface Processes (3) GEOL 360 - Structural Geology (4) GEOL 380 - Geologic Field Techniques (3) GEOL 406 - Geochemistry (3) or GEOL 456 - Geophysics (3) or GEOL 476 - Engineering Geology (3) GEOL 481A - Geology Field Camp I (4) GEOL 498 - Undergraduate Thesis (1-3) Upper-Division Geological Sciences Electives (8-9 units) Electives should be selected in consultation with an undergraduate adviser and/or the student’s thesis adviser. No more than 3 units from any combination of GEOL 493 , GEOL 495 , GEOL 496L and GEOL 499L can be counted toward meeting this eight- to nine-unit requirement. Note: GEOL 310T is not accepted as credit toward meeting requirements for the B.S. in Geology major. Related Fields (30 units minimum) At least one of the related field’s tracks must include a second semester lab course. If the selected related field’s courses total less than 30 units, additional units must be taken from other science-math-engineering departments (see list below). Courses not included on the list must be approved in writing by an undergraduate adviser. BIOL 101 - Elements of Biology (3) or BIOL 171 - Evolution and Biodiversity (4) or a life science course from another institution that is acceptable to CSUF and demonstrates treatment of whole-organism biology and concepts of evolution and ecology.
