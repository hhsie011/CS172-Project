Our holdings specialize in modern and contemporary architecture and design, the history and theory of architecture, urban studies, landscape architecture, preservation, and city planning. The collection constitutes approximately 35,000 volumes on-site with thousands more housed in the Research Collections and Preservation Consortium (ReCAP) facility. The library subscribes to more than 300 domestic and foreign periodicals, and has a growing collection of rare materials as well as a video collection. The video collection focuses broadly on productions relating to the built environment. We collect experimental videos, interviews, features, documentaries, and cult classics. The Video Library (formerly the Humanities Resource Center), located in Firestone Library, also offers a wide range of films listed in the library catalog.
