New Orleans Music Culture 10 Years Later Posted on October 1, 2015 by [email protected] In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent flooding from the failed levee system had a profound impact on New Orleans and its music culture. Almost a thousand people perished in the region and thousands more fled the city before, during and after the disaster. Although musicians and artists were some of the first to return in hopes of restoring their own lives and re-establishing the culture that defines the city, the past decade has been a struggle for many—personally, professionally, and communally. This exhibit hopes to highlight some of the successes and failures of this post-Katrina period. Dates: October 1, 2015 – April 2016 Time: Open to the public during Library hours Location: Lobby of Orwig Music Library This entry was posted in Exhibits & Events by [email protected].
