Students must purchase a permit at the beginning of each semester to park on campus. The cost of the permit parking is added to the student bill through Catalyst. The cost varies depending on the garage. Remote parking options are also available at a lower rate. If you arrive on campus and the sign for your permitted garage says FULL, space is still available for permit holders. The FULL sign is directed towards visitors to campus. Students have the option to pay the daily rate in campus garages with cash, Bearcat Card or credit card. If the FULL sign is lit, you will need to proceed to another facility. Use our convenient Visitor Tracker to find real-time availability.
