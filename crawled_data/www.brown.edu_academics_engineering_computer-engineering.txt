Bachelor of Arts Concentration Options Declaring a Concentration Computer Engineering Sc.B. in Computer Engineering Computer engineers specialize in applications which require a knowledge of both electrical engineering and computer science. They design and manufacture computer hardware (from chips to servers); they design and operate networks and communication systems; and have developed many of the 'smart' devices that continue to change the way we live and work. They are at the forefront of fields such as cybersecurity; machine intelligence; networking; and embedded systems. The computer engineering undergraduate program combines the best of the School of Engineering with Brown's world-class Department of Computer Science. Students take courses in both departments, gaining proficiency in both software and hardware. Their interdisciplinary foundation also prepares them to identify and implement innovative applications for hardware and software. Nearly all students in the computer engineering program engage in collaborative research with faculty through internships or independent study. These provide students access to state-of-the-art facilities in computer engineering and computer vision such as those of the Laboratory for Engineering Man/Machine Systems. The concentration has the following structure: The interdisciplinary core for computer engineering taken during the first two years. The C.E. core is similar to other engineering programs, but is structured to include more courses in computer science and a somewhat different emphasis in mathematics Specialized upper level courses A capstone design course Four approved humanities courses Sample course plan For complete requirements, please see the University Bulletin.
