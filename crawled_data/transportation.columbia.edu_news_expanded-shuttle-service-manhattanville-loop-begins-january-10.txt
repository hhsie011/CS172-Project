Starting January 10, 2022, the Manhattanville Loop shuttle, which runs between the Manhattanville and Morningside Heights campuses, will operate from 7:20 a.m. until 10:30 p.m. on weekdays throughout the academic year, including summer. Please note: in order to accommodate this expanded daily schedule, there may be some shifts to the previous timetable. For example, the Metro-North 8:23 a.m. departure was replaced with a 7:23 a.m. departure, but keep in mind riders can still utilize the 8:10 (Red Line) and 8:30 (Green Line) departures from Metro-North via the Intercampus Shuttle. See a preview of the updated schedule. The maps and timetables on the Manhattanville Loop page will be updated when the service launches on January 10.
