Once we’ve learned more about the water on our planet, participants will create artwork to be submitted to the Columbia Global Centers No Boundaries project. Selected art will be on display at Reid Hall in fall. Find out about last year’s exhibition in New York here. About No Boundaries: Columbia Global Centers, in partnership with the No-Boundaries Committee, have launched the No-Boundaries International Art Exhibitions to foster global awareness and social responsibility in young citizens around the world. The exhibitions aim to build an international art and educational platform by connecting young artists without boundaries of nationality, languages, or culture. Their art will be shown in galleries open to the public in the host cities Paris, Nairobi, New York and Rio de Janeiro. Each city will exhibit selected artwork of children locally and from the other sites, and display a digital representation of all the artwork from children worldwide. ATTENTION: This event will take place at The American Library in Paris (10, rue du Général Camou, 75007 Paris) This program does not require advance registration, however, each child attending must have their own Library card, or be covered by a family membership otherwise the non-member fee applies. Unless otherwise stated, all programs are free for library members and 10€ for non-members. Caregivers are expected to familiarize themselves with these guidelines so that we can provide a pleasant library environment for all patrons.
