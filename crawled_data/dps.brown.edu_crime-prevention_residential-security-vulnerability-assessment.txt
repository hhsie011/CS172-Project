The Department of Public Safety, Crime Prevention Unit provides free Residential Security Vulnerability Assessments for Brown students that live off-campus. This program proposes to: Reduce off-campus risks and hazards by providing students and home-owners with information and strategies that enhance personal safety and home security. Recommendations are not foolproof but will certainly maximize residential safety. Improve the quality of life for students and neighboring communities. Develop residential environments where crime cannot flourish. A check-list to assist our Crime Prevention personnel has been developed with CPTED (Crime Prevention through Environmental Design) principles in mind. The Officer(s), accompanied by the resident/owner, will conduct a comprehensive tour and assessment of the residence and furnish a security recommendation report within 10-days of the assessment. Residential Security Vulnerability Assessments can be requested by email submitted to campus_safety@brown.edu or by completing a registration form. Upon receiving a request, the Brown Crime Prevention Unit will schedule a vulnerability assessment with any Brown student or staff member living within the jurisdiction of Brown DPS shuttle route services.
