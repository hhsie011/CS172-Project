Do you not have the time or expertise to innovate? The Data Science Course Design Institute (DSCDI) is a great opportunity for you to begin to develop new, or enhance existing data science related content in your course. As a participant in the DSCDI you will become familiar with the literature on teaching data science content, create an inclusive learning experience for all learners, and share examples of data science teaching. Participants in the institute receive priority to collaborate with a Data Science Fellow in Fall 2021. The data science fellow is an undergraduate student with data science skills to assist with curricular development (while enrolled in DATA 1150). Data science fellow wages are compensated by the Sheridan Center and thus no cost to you or your department. Faculty successfully completing the institute also receive a $750.00 stipend. Past participants in the DSCDI find the implementation of their curricular innovations greatly advanced by the collaborative discussions and information in the DSCDI. Some examples of past projects include: Developing in-class tutorials on R and Python Enhancing data visualizations of challenging statistical principles Text mining literature corpus to identify key readings to align with learning outcomes Leveraging Python to study Arabic proper name roots and cultural connections Developing machine learning examples using domain specific data Exploring image segmentation to identify a process to categorize ancient images for classroom instruction Web scraping and text mining student survey responses to provide formative feedback for curricular content The next DSCDI will be delivered remotely over the weeks of August 2nd, 9th, and 16th, 2021. There will be one hour and a half synchronous session each Thursday, with the remaining work and discussions to be completed each week. Faculty interested in learning more about the DSCDI are asked to complete the interest form.
