Forbes ranked the University of Miami among the top employers in Florida this year. This is the third time the University has been included on the list, which is based on independent surveys of employees. “The recognition as one of America’s best employers is a reflection of our strong culture of belonging and the importance of fostering an environment where everyone can feel valued and add value,” said Mary Harper Hagan, vice president for Human Resources. “The contributions of faculty and staff continue to drive our mission and we are proud to receive this honor.” The acknowledgement, which has been awarded to both the University’s Coral Gables and Marine campuses and health system, is measured through an independent survey of 80,000 U.S. employees across 25 industry sectors and considers every aspect of the employee experience. “Our employees are the reason that we are able to provide preeminent health care to our community and patients,” said Bri Neuburger, interim chief human resources officer, University of Miami Health System. “We are proud of the incredible work being done every day and this recognition reflects our commitment to our collective success.” To compile the rankings, Forbes partnered with Statista, an online statistics provider, to conduct an independent survey. Participation in the survey was voluntary, and respondents were recruited from thousands of sources to maximize reach and representation. topics: University Announcements University of Miami Coral Gables, FL 33124 305-284-2211 University of Miami News Sub Coral Gables, FL 33124 305-284-2211 305-284-2211 UM Network About UM UM News and Events Admissions Alumni Association UHealth Hurricane Sports University Hotline UM Culture Tools and Resources Academic Calendar People Search Department Search MyUM CaneLink Blackboard Workday Employment Visit Campus Map Parking & Transportation Connect social-facebook social-twitter social-youtube social-instagram Copyright: 2022 University of Miami.
