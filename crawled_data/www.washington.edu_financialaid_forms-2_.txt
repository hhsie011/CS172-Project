We encourage the completion of the DocuSign form if possible. DocuSign forms are submitted through an online process. DocuSign forms require you to log in with your NetID and password. PDF forms may be returned to the campus you are attending Seattle, Bothell, or Tacoma by mail, fax, or in-person. If a form is available in both DocuSign/online and pdf versions, please submit only one form. We encourage documents be sent electronically via DocuSign. Students may use the Document Upload – Student link to submit documents for the student, their spouse (if married) and/or their parent. If a parent or third party wants to submit documents electronically via DocuSign on behalf of the student, the student will initiate the Document Upload – Parent/Third Party link to allow them to do so. You can see what documents have been requested and their processing status on MyUW Financial Aid Status – Document Tracker. FAFSA® Privacy Act Statement Authority: Sections 483 and 484 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, give us the authority to ask these questions, and to collect Social Security numbers (SSN), from both you and your parents. Purpose: We use the information provided on your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form to determine if you are eligible to receive federal student aid and the amount that you are eligible to receive. Your SSN is used to verify your identity and retrieve your records. We may request your SSN again for these purposes. State and institutional student financial aid programs also may use the information provided on your FAFSA form to determine if you are eligible to receive state and institutional aid and the financial need that you have for such aid.
