The exhibition encompasses our best graphic design, motion graphics, branding, web and cross-disciplinary collaboration, which we showcase to the design industry with a safe and sensational event. The graduating class of 2022 proudly presents: RENDER. To render is to iterate, generate, and progress. Our lives as designers—the challenges, connections, and works— are not defined by a picture, but by the process. We are the designers rendered by UHGD, and our next iteration begins now.
