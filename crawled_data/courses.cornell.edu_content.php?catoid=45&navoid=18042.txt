To ensure that students have adequate insurance, annually, full-time registered students must either confirm enrollment in SHP or, if eligible, waive. Students who do not enroll or waive are automatically enrolled in Cornell’s Student Health Plan (SHP). SHP, which provides excellent coverage on campus, in the Ithaca community, and anywhere in the world. (Exception: some NY State Medicaid-eligible students may enroll in SHP Plus.) Eligible domestic students who can demonstrate that they have alternate health insurance that meets Cornell’s requirements may apply to waive their enrollment in SHP (Fall 2021 waiver application deadline: July 31). For more information about SHP, Cornell’s requirements, and the waiver application process, please visit studenthealthbenefits.cornell.edu.
