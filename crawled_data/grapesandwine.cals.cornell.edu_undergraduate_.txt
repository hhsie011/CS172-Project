Our students don't just hear about science, they practice it every day. Graduates leave Cornell with the ability to enter the wine industry, apply their scientific knowledge to another industry or career path, or enter graduate school in a number of science fields. Program tailored to comparing New York with other winemaking regions Cornell’s V&E major addresses the New York region’s unique challenges—the cool climate, soils, grape varieties, pests, and markets—while also providing an excellent grounding in other regions’ growing and winemaking techniques. Students work with a broad variety of grapes and vinification techniques to produce wines in a region with large variability between growing seasons. If you can make good wine here, you can produce it anywhere! Personalize your major and broaden your education All V&E students learn about the science and practices of growing grapes and making wines. Whether focusing on viticulture or enology, you can choose the electives that target your particular interests. For example, students can concentrate on business and management by taking electives in the college’s Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management and throughout the university. Cornell offers a diversity of courses taught by leaders in their fields, and V&E students are able to take courses in all colleges to follow interests outside of their major. Focus on experiential learning Internships are an integral part of the program, and with New York’s nearly 1,400 vineyards and wineries, there’s no end to interesting opportunities nearby. Students may also choose to study or intern in other U.S. wine regions or abroad. Many of our students have completed two or three internships by the time they graduate, gaining valuable skills and industry contacts. Ample opportunities also exist for undergraduate research at Cornell. Learn in other wine regions and countries The opportunities and connections offered through Cornell’s exchange and study abroad programs are exciting. The chance to study at many institutions throughout the world allows our students to increase their breadth of knowledge about growing grapes and producing wines, while improving language skills and understanding of other cultures.
