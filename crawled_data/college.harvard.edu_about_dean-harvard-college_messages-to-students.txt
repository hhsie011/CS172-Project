COVID Update – January Remote Status December 18th, 2021 Wishing you a wonderful winter break December 17th, 2021 As our first semester back together comes to a close, I feel both invigorated by our return to campus life and ready for the holiday break. As thrilled as I have been to return to campus, I have also been in a state of unrelenting alertness for many months now, ready to respond to new information and ensure our community's well-being. Gratitude November 23rd, 2021 As the days become shorter, I am reminded of the importance of looking for light in the winter months. Ever since our full community returned to campus this fall, I have been grateful for each opportunity to see you and speak with you Welcome Home August 19th, 2021 I am looking forward to seeing you back on campus next week. I have so missed looking out my office window and seeing the Yard alive with activity, stopping to chat with you across our campus, and having the opportunity to recite the College’s mission of educating citizens and citizen-leaders for society in person. Congratulations and Looking Ahead May 27th, 2021 I write to share my heartfelt congratulations to all of you for finishing this very challenging academic year. Yesterday's Verdict and the Path Ahead April 21st, 2021 Writing to you in the aftermath of the news that the jury has found Derek Chauvin guilty of murder, I continue to process everything that has brought our country to this point—and all that still lies ahead. FAS Fall 2021 Planning Update March 22nd, 2021 I am writing to follow up on Dean Gay's message announcing that Harvard College expects a full return to campus for the Fall 2021 semester. Hate has no place here March 18th, 2021 Following President Bacow and Dean Gay’s messages, I write to share my outrage and frustration about the recent acts of violence against Asian, Asian American, and Pacific Islander communities, including the senseless murders in Atlanta that included at least six women of Asian descent. Beginning the Spring Together January 26th, 2021 It is a pleasure to welcome you back for the spring semester, whether you have returned to campus or are learning remotely. When I wrote to you last August, I encouraged you to embrace the idea that Harvard exists everywhere that you are despite the distances between us.
