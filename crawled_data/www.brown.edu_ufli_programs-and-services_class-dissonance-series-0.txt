The series affirms the cultural wealth found within working class communities as a means to better understand the cultural dissonance experienced by working class students as they move through elite spaces. Through public lectures, performances, and workshops, the series explores the complexities of class identity and struggle, while examining the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, education, and migration.
