There are courses targeted at students with strongly developed interests in biology, and courses for non-majors interested in learning more about biology or meeting their science distribution requirements. The biology department has prepared a two-year schedule of courses. Please understand that this schedule will change and the department will post new versions as changes happen. Please be sure you are working from the most current version. The most current version was posted on May 8, 2022. To download the May 18, 2022 version, please click here. For information on current course offerings, please visit the Biological Sciences ORC listing on the Registrar's webpage. Course Progression For many students, Biology 11, The Science of Life, will be the entrance course to the major. Students who perform well on the Biology Placement test (available in Canvas) may decide to start the major by enrolling in courses at the Foundation Level. Foundation Level courses are prerequisites for Intermediate Level and Advanced Level courses. For more detailed information about the major, please visit our Majors and Minors page. Course Syllabi We have posted these syllabi to give students general information about course content. Course content is often revised from term to term. Some courses are taught more than once a year and by multiple faculty.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Biological Sciences Undergraduate Overview Welcome Class of 2026 Welcome Back Classes of 2023, 2024, 2025 Major & Minor Course Schedules & Syllabi Current and Upcoming Bio 11 and Foundation Classes First Year Writing Seminars - Biology 7 Biology 11 Foundation Course Offerings Foundation Level Course Syllabi Intermediate Level Course Syllabi Advanced Level Course Syllabi Non-Major Course Syllabi Foreign Study Program Faculty Advisors Teaching Science Fellows Independent Study & the Honors Program Research Opportunities Dartmouth-sponsored Research Programs Funding and Finding an Advisor Transfer Credits Graduate Overview Ecology, Evolution, Environment & Society Molecular and Cellular Biology Research Overview Resources & Research Facilities Life Sciences Light Microscopy Facility Faculty Publications Neukom Postdoctoral Fellowship Foreign Study Program Seminars, News & Events News & Events Cramer Seminar Series Chris Reed Memorial Lecture Past Symposia and Conferences Travel People SEPA My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
