One of the world’s most distinguished violinists, Stern was also known for his lifelong commitment to musical activism. He mentored young artists such as Yo-Yo Ma and Pinchas Zukerman, promoted musical education on three continents, saved Carnegie Hall from destruction and was a dedicated and strong advocate for the role of the arts in today’s society. Among his numerous honors, he was Officier de la Légion d’honneur, a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors, the Wolf Prize in Israel, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States’ highest civilian award. As part of the celebration of Isaac Stern’s centenary, his son, conductor David Stern, founder of Opera Fuoco, will speak and present the Academy Award-winning film From Mao to Mozart: Isaac Stern in China, recounting the violinist’s historic trip a few years after the Cultural Revolution. This event is in conjunction with “Stern Filiations,” a tribute to Isaac Stern at the Philharmonie de Paris on October 1, when David Stern will conduct pieces from Bach to Mendelssohn.
