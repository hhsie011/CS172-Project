IDIF Focus: Inspired Living The United States is on the brink of a housing crisis for adults with cognitive disabilities with the unfortunate alternative of homelessness for those without a safety net. As both family caregivers and adults with autism age, there is a need to transition adults to semi-independent living situations before family members pass away. Inspired Living is a technology-based network to aggregate and match housing demand; it has a premium consultancy feature to increase available residential units for adults with cognitive disabilities. Image Edward Silva Edward Silva grew up in a big family on a small farm in California’s Central Valley.

Over the last six years, he worked in multiple aspects of commercialization of agricultural technology, from launching a company to helping researchers spin out innovations. His calling is to apply advanced technology appropriately to solve major challenges in agriculture. IDIF Focus: AgAi AgAi is focused on helping specialty farmers know more about what they grow using plant-level computer vision and AI to count, size, and detect irregularities in crops. This actionable data will allow farmers to optimize produce shipping, pricing, harvesting, and ultimately be more precise with the amount of inputs applied to their crop, with the goal of reducing pesticide and fertilizer applications from crops and the environment.

Image Sami Tellatin Prior to attending Stanford Graduate School of Business, Sami earned a BS in biological engineering from the University of Missouri, where she discovered a passion for land management that led her to work on farms in Missouri and Costa Rica. Afterward, she worked as a project manager for the USDA’s Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education program looking at the ecosystem impacts of agricultural practices. Today, Sami is exploring the intersection of profitability and environmental stewardship and looks forward to applying this lens to agriculture. IDIF Focus The United States has lost half of its productive topsoil in the last two centuries, yet only a fraction of U.S. cropland is engaged in soil conservation efforts. This project will enhance our understanding of business-driven solutions to the erosion challenge and will specifically examine farmer experiences and needs regarding the practice of cover cropping on Midwestern farms. Through this work, possible business models that meet farmer needs will be explored. 655 Knight Way Stanford, CA 94305 USA Footer contact links Contact Us Visit Us Stay In Touch Follow Us Twitter Facebook Instagram YouTube LinkedIn Footer 1 Companies, Organizations & Recruiters Stanford Community Newsroom Footer 2 Library Jobs MyGSB © Stanford Graduate School of Business Footer legal links Accessibility Non-Discrimination Policy Privacy Policy Terms of Use Stanford University The Experience Overview of The Experience About Us Overview of Stanford GSB COVID-19 Information Overview of COVID-19 Information Virtual Meeting Backgrounds The Leadership Overview of The Leadership Updates Advisory Council Overview of Advisory Council Members Centers & Institutes Overview of Centers & Institutes Center for Entrepreneurial Studies Overview of Center for Entrepreneurial Studies Research Overview of Research Search Funds Overview of Search Funds Search Fund Primer Teaching & Curriculum Faculty & Staff Affiliated Faculty Overview of Faculty & Staff Faculty Advisors Contact View Contact Information Louis W.
