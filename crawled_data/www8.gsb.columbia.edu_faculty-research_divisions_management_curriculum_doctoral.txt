Many research topics span subfield boundaries and most faculty members teach and conduct research in more than one subfield. All PhD candidates develop basic skills to conduct research on organizations and then prepare individually tailored programs of study. Micro Organizational Behavior is the study of how individuals and groups affect and are affected by organizations. Drawing primarily on social and cognitive psychology, this area includes such topics as decision-making, learning, work motivation and satisfaction, negotiation and bargaining, communication, cooperation and altruism, organizational culture, emotions, group processes, stereotyping, and injustice and power and influence. Macro Organizational Theory and Strategic Management is the study of organizations as systems, relationships among organizations, and organizational environments. Drawing primarily on organizational and economic sociology, as well as economics, this area explores topics such as organizational structure and demography, organizational change, employment relations, technology and innovation, inter-organizational networks, and organizational performance and survival.
