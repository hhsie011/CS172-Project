Our three programs prepare students to be responsible citizens and effective communicators in a global society, armed with the knowledge and skills to interpret, understand, and improve the human condition. Sociology includes all aspects of people's social behavior in many different types of settings. Its goal is to advance our understanding of the interrelations of culture, community, organizational and socioeconomic structures, personal relations, and individual identities in our rapidly changing and increasingly globalized social world. Anthropology studies all aspects of culture across time and space, taking an integrated view of humanity from its deep past to diverse modernity. It is committed to investigating and explaining the diversity of ancient and modern human cultures and societies. Social Work is dedicated to partnering with people to create change. It trains its students to use self-awareness and sensitivity to the plight of humankind to promote social justice within our interdependent global community. Our Programs Our department offers Master of Arts (MA) degrees in sociology and anthropology and a Master of Social Work (MSW) degree. At the undergraduate level, we offer Bachelor of Arts (BA) degrees in all three programs. Sociology BA students have the option of concentrating in criminology, and anthropology BA students can choose a concentration in forensic anthropology. We also have minors in all three programs. We invite you to explore our website and learn more about our degree programs, our faculty, our research, and the opportunities we offer students at home and abroad.
