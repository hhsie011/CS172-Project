Although Habermas places satirists like Swift and Pope in the public sphere, this book investigates their participation in clandestine strategies of attack in a world understood to be harboring dangerous secrets. Authors of anonymous pamphlets as well as major figures including Behn, Dryden, Manley, Swift, and Pope, share at times what Swift called the writer’s “life by stealth.” Reviews "The significance of Satire and Secrecy would be in its suggestion of an explanatory/critical model for reading post-Augustan satire that brings a conception of secrecy (with its various employment of gossip, slander, secret history, and so on) into the picture as a key satiric strategy. Rabb's view of satiric secrecy would open up doors of understanding for numerous texts. Her study, provocatively and broadly contemplates a conceptual revision of the public/private divide."--Ruben Quintero, California State University, Los Angeles ISBN: 978-1-4039-8434-0 Home Faculty Office Hours Undergraduate Graduate Nonfiction Writing Program Courses Contact Us Media Events Print this Page Share this Page Brown University Box 1852 70 Brown St. Providence, RI 02912 Phone 401-863-2393 Fax 401-863-7412 English Events There are currently no events to display.
