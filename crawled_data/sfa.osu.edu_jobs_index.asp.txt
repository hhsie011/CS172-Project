The program encourages community service work and employment related to their course of study. FWS is a form of federal financial aid, and eligibility is determined when you file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) each year. Once offered, you must accept FWS from the Financial Aid Summary in My Buckeye Link. Unlike other forms of financial aid (such as scholarships, grants and loans) FWS does not pay your tuition or housing charges directly. Rather, you will search for a job listed as work-study eligible and apply for that job. Once hired, you receive a paycheck bi-weekly that is subtracted from your total FWS offer over the course of the year. You can monitor the reduction from your Financial Aid Summary tab as you work. Note: Your FWS earnings are FICA exempt and not counted against your income eligibility on next year's FAFSA, but they are taxable by the IRS.
