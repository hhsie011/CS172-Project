We offer therapy, groups, workshops and medication to assist students in maintaining emotional and mental health. We support the College’s commitment to diversity, raising awareness of systems of oppression and unequal access to resources, and work to promote social justice. Health Care setting still requires masking. Because psychotherapy with masks is difficult and limited, we will continue to provide mostly tele therapy sessions. However, in –person sessions will be available, in consultation with the therapists.
