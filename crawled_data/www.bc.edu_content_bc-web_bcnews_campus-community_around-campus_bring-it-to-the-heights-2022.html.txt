Bastien’s singing ability also led to her first-place finish in the 2020 edition. 2022 Bring It to the Heights winner Stencia Bastien '23 The “American Idol”-inspired competition— formerly called Sing it to the Heights, but renamed to emphasize its new inclusion of a variety of talent performances, such as card tricks—raised $1,712 to support afterschool programs and student tuition at Saint Columbkille Partnership School, a Catholic elementary school in Brighton operated by the Saint Columbkille Parish, the Archdiocese of Boston, and Boston College. The event, which features a judges panel of Boston College Jesuits—Donald MacMillan, S.J., and School of Theology and Ministry students Sean Hagerty, S.J., and Damian Torres-Botello, S.J., served this year—has the dual aim of providing support for Saint Columbkille and showcasing the talents of Boston College students. “The Emerging Leader Program and Saint Columbkille Partnership School has a long history of a positive relationship and bond,” said Dylan Gay, a graduate assistant in the Office of Student Involvement who co-organized the event, who added that ELP students serve Saint Columbkille by supporting their afterschool programs.
