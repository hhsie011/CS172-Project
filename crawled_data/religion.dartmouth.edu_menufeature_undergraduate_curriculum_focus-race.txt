We will look at women's experiences of social change in African religions, the encounter with Islam, slavery, Christianity, and colonialism. We will analyze the articulations of economic and political power or lack of power in religious ideas as we ask questions such as: What are the different antecedents and circumstances in which women exercise or are denied agency, leadership, power and happiness in their communities? Texts will include nonfiction, fiction, and film narratives. Open to all students. 2022 Fall Term Courses REL 1.06 Getting Religion This introductory course invites students to "get religion" as a historical and lived reality in the modern world by engaging religious belief, belonging, and behavior in the unfolding spiritual landscape of the Atlantic world, from the beginning of colonial encounters to the present era. Exploring how individuals, families, and groups of people "get religion" under free, un-free, and secretive conditions, students will examine key historical episodes of modern religious encounter, embrace, and exchange. 2023 Winter Term Courses REL 7.09 Living with the Dead: Religion and Spirituality in American History This First-Year Seminar introduces students to American religious history and spirituality by focusing on how humans deal with death and the dead. Encounters with immaterial human subjects in North American history are somewhat distinct from communing and communicating with deities in a religion's pantheon. They involve religious subjects performing ritual engagement with human beings across time and space—those who have "passed on"—for familial, social, and even political purposes. Religious uses of the language of ancestors, "mystical persons," and concepts of martyrdom and "mortuary politics" invite reflection on the material impacts of spiritual subjects in this world for various groups. This course will familiarize students with various "Spiritual" traditions in North American religious history, paying attention to the complex categories and identities of race and gender in living religious subjects as well as the deceased subjects they engage—the dead who "talk back." As a First-Year Seminar, this course will prepare students to analyze American religion as thoughtful writers. For each evening meeting of the course, we will gather to focus on historical or ethnographic monographs, spanning the period of colonial encounters in America to the present. A variety of course media, including documentaries, interviews, films, podcasts, websites, and material/visual archives will supplement our learning experience. To develop analysis as writers over the term, students will produce 5 (five) 1-page response papers to religious documentaries and films, one short essay on an extended poem about communicating with the dead, and one culminating research paper. Dist: TMV. REL 61 Religion and the Civil Rights Movement (Identical to AAAS 22) This course presents the religious dimensions of civil rights activism in twentieth-century United States history. Students will explore the theologies of African American Protestants, liberal religious thinkers, and adherents to Gandhian philosophy as they waged nonviolent struggle against Jim Crow oppression in the United States. In-class discussions and exercises will examine the religious rhetoric and creative protest strategies of movement activists. Open to all.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Religion Undergraduate Overview Major and Minor Curriculum Course Schedule Dickinson Seminar Focus on Race Non-Western Courses Honors Program Sperry Fellows Program Past Honors Theses Career Information Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Awards and Prizes The Charles Howard Dudley Prize The Dickinson Senior Writing Prize in Religion The Hans Penner Prize The Religion Department Faculty Award The Sperry Writing Prize in Religion Foreign Study Program News & Events Overview Dickinson Distinguished Lecture Forum on Race & Religion Hardigg Family Fund Lecture Past Fellows Orr Lecture on Culture & Religion Past Lectures People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
