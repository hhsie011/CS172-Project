of Management College of Natural Resources College of Sciences Wilson College of Textiles CODA Application CODA Application Deadlines Add a Minor Drop a Major or Minor College of Sciences To transfer into specific College of Sciences majors (as a current NC State student) see requirements and preferred qualifications listed below. This includes students who wish to change their major, as well as those who want to add a major in the College of Sciences. Students must meet the listed “Minimum Requirements” in order to submit an online CODA application to transfer (see CODA Application). These Minimum requirements must be complete at the time the application is submitted. Candidates who meet the preferred qualifications outlined below have a higher probability of being approved for transfer. Preferred Qualifications can be completed after the application is submitted up until the application deadline date. All admission is competitive and based on space availability in the specific program. Meeting the preferred qualifications does not guarantee admission to the desired major. If you have questions about transferring to programs in the College of Sciences, contact the departmental Advising Coordinator for your program of interest here. Biological Sciences Degree Programs BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES (BA) Minimum to apply and be considered: Completion of 12 or more NC State graded credit hours Cumulative GPA must be 2.0 or better Completion of CH 101 with a C- or better Completion of BIO 181 or BIO 183 with a C- or better Preference will be given to students who meet the following: Completion of BIO 181, BIO 183, and CH 101 with a combined GPA of 3.0 or better, and Completion of MA 121/131/141 with a grade of C- or better BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES (BS) BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES (BS): ECOLOGY, EVOLUTION, AND CONSERVATION BIOLOGY BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES (BS): HUMAN BIOLOGY BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES (BS): INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY AND NEUROBIOLOGY BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES (BS): MOLECULAR, CELLULAR, AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY Minimum to apply and be considered: Completion of 12 or more NC State graded credit hours Cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher A grade of C or higher in CH 101 Completion of BIO 181 or BIO 183 with a C or higher Students with lower grades in introductory courses that keep them from applying, but who have significantly stronger grades in higher level CH and BIO courses, are encouraged to reach out to the Coordinator of Advising (Dana Thomas, dcthoma4@ncsu.edu).
