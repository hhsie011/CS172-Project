We have been engaged in a University-wide project of creating Diversity and Inclusion Action Plans (DIAP) that address issues of diversity and inclusion in relation to our faculty, staff, students, and curriculum. As part of our DIAP, the Chair, in partnership with the Administrative Team, has established a Department Committee for Diversity, Inclusivity, and Outreach, that is composed of Faculty, staff, graduate, and undergraduate students. We have also instituted regular training and awareness opportunities for all department members.
