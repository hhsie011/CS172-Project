Students choose to major in film if they want to learn more about the art form, from technology to cultural significance; want to work in the film industry; or are interested in a major that combines arts and humanities. Students usually declare the major toward the end of the second year by meeting with the departmental adviser; together, they create a program of twelve required courses within the major, often supplemented by courses outside the department. In the lecture classes and seminars, there tends to be a mixed population of undergraduate majors and graduate film students. Students have the opportunity to gain additional experience by taking advantage of internship opportunities with film companies, working on graduate student films, and participating in the Columbia Undergraduate Film Productions (CUFP), an active, student-run organization that provides film-making experience to Columbia undergraduate producers and directors. In addition to careers in screenwriting, directing, and producing, alumni have gone on to work in film distribution, publicity, archives, and festivals, and to attend graduate school to become teachers and scholars. The trajectory of the major is from introductory-level courses (three are required), to intermediate and advanced-level courses (two are required, plus seven electives). While film studies majors take workshops in screenwriting and film-making, the course of study is rooted in film history, theory, and culture. The prerequisite for all classes is Introduction to Film and Media Studies (FILM UN1000) offered each term at Columbia as well as at Barnard, and open to first-year students. Subsequently, majors take a combination of history survey courses; workshops ("Labs"); and advanced classes in theory, genre study, national cinemas, auteur study, and screenwriting. The educational goal is to provide film majors with a solid grounding in the history and theory of film; its relation to other forms of art; and its synthesis of visual storytelling, technology, economics, and sociopolitical context, as well as the means to begin writing a script and making a short film. Students who wish to graduate with honors must take the Senior Seminar in Film Studies (FILM UN3900), writing a thesis that reflects mastery of cinematic criticism. The essay is submitted after the winter break. Students decide upon the topic with the professor and develop the essay during the fall semester. Since film courses tend to be popular, it is imperative that students attend the first class. Registration priority is usually given to film majors and seniors. Departmental Honors In order to qualify for departmental honors, students must have a GPA of 3.75 in the major and distinction in their overall achievements in film study. Students who take FILM UN3900 Senior Seminar in Film Studies automatically enter consideration for honors; however, the class is not a requirement for honors.

Building on the fundamentals established in the Labs for Fiction and Non-Fiction Filmmaking, this seminar further develops each student’s grasp of the concepts involved in filmmaking through advanced analytical and practical work to prepare Thesis film materials. Short films are the gateway for any writer/director or producer seeking a career in film. From pitch to script to final film, students learn the importance of identifying and developing producible ideas and scripts that feature a strong directorial “voice.” Starting with a close analysis of successful short films, students then apply those principles in writing, directing and producing their own Thesis short film. A study of the marketplace for short films (festivals and distribution) and the industry and academic options available to emerging filmmakers, enables students to develop an action plan for the completed Thesis short film.

Study of major films in the seven-decade career of Jeanne Moreau (1928-2017), the performing artist who is widely recognized as France’s greatest actress of the post-World War II era and who has also been a pioneering female director. Topics include: the value for film criticism and history of conceptualizing the performer as a creative auteur; Moreau’s manner(s) of film acting and role realization; the risks and the productive consequences of her serving as “muse” to such male directors as Louis Malle, François Truffaut, Orson Welles, Joseph Losey, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, and Paul Mazursky, and as a creative partner to such female directors as Marguerite Duras and Josée Dayan; her embodiments and projections of sexuality and sensuality and how they differ from those of other so-called “screen love goddesses” (Brigitte Bardot, Elizabeth Taylor, Sophia Loren, Simone Signoret, Catherine Deneuve); Moreau’s own work as a director of feature-length films; the rewards and burdens of international stardom and the challenge of being expected to “represent” France and its cinema; growing old in the public eye and life-long strategies for career renewal and sustainability FILM UN3950 Seminar in Media: Seriality. 3 points. From streaming to binge-viewing, Serial to Breaking Bad, seriality is a preeminent framework for the orchestration of contemporary media production and consumption. This course explores histories and theories of seriality as a recurrent trope of media cultures over the last century and more. To this end, the course adopts a comparative media perspective, exploring seriality in its varied textual manifestations across diverse media forms (the penny press, early cinema, television, podcasts, and social media). It also focuses on the range of functions that seriality has performed, as, e.g., a mode for the systematization of mass cultural reproduction, as a framework for the integration of fan networks and media systems, even as a vehicle for the creation of national and political communities. FILM UN3960 Intro to Experimental Film & Video. 3 points. This course provides an overview of experimental film and video since the early 20th century European art movements (abstract, Dada, Surrealism), including the emergence of American experimental film in the 1940s, post-World War II underground experimental films, structuralist films and early video art in the 1960s and 70s, post-1960s identitarian experimental work, the emergence of digital video in museums and online in the 1990s to the present. The course surveys and analyses a wide range of experimental work, including the artists Hans Richter, Luis Bunuel, Salvador Dali, Joseph Cornell, Maya Deren, Andy Warhol, Stan Brakhage, Michael Snow, Martha Rosler, Vito Acconci, Barbara Hammer, Su Friedrich, Julie Dash, Isaac Julien, Matthew Barney, Ryan Trecartin, and others. The course will study the structural, aesthetic and thematic links between mainstream and avant-garde cinema, theater, and art movements, and will place the films in their economic, social, and political contexts. FILM GU4000 Film and Media Theory. 3 points. Fee: $50. An introduction to some of the major texts in film theory, with particular attention to film theory's evolving relations to a number of philosophical issues: the nature of the aesthetic; the relation of symbolic forms to the construction of human subjectivities; narrative and the structure of experience; modernity, technology, popular culture, and the rise of mass political formations; and meaning, intention, and authorship.

This course provides an overview of experimental moving images from the European "city symphonies" and abstract films of the 1920s to the flowering of the American postwar avant-garde; from the advent of video art in the 1960s to the online viral videos and digital gallery installations of today. The class thus surveys the artists, institutions, and viewers that have fostered moving image art throughout the history of film, and asks students to consider the historical, social, and institutional forces that have engendered oppositional, political, and aesthetically radical cinemas. A central premise of the course is that technological developments such as video and new media are not historical ruptures, but part of an ongoing tradition of moving-image art making. Other core topics include the consideration of the meaning and use-value of the avant-garde, the issue of “artists’ film and video” as opposed to “experimental film,” and the thorny relationship between avant-garde and commercial filmmaking. FILM GU4320 New Directions in Film and Philosophy. 0 points. FILM GU4910 Seeing Narrative. 3 points. Prerequisites: the instructor's permission. An advanced film theory “workshop” in which we shall avoid reading film theory in favor of a selection of other texts, taken mainly from the domains of art history, philosophy, and literature. Our central question will be: What can filmmakers and film theorists learn from discourses about vision and its relation to narrative that pre-date the cinema, or that consider the cinema only marginally? FILM GU4940 Queer Cinema. 3 points. This course examines themes and changes in the (self-)representation of lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, and transgender people in cinema from the early sound period to the present. It pays attention to both the formal qualities of film and filmmakers’ use of cinematic strategies (mise-en-scene, editing, etc.) designed to elicit certain responses in viewers and to the distinctive possibilities and constraints of the classical Hollywood studio system, independent film, avant-garde cinema, and world cinema; the impact of various regimes of formal and informal censorship; the role of queer men and women as screenwriters, directors, actors, and designers; and the competing visions of gay, progay, and antigay filmmakers. Along with considering the formal properties of film and the historical forces that shaped it, the course explores what cultural analysts can learn from film. How can we treat film as evidence in historical analysis? We will consider the films we see as evidence that may shed new light on historical problems and periodization, and will also use the films to engage with recent queer theoretical work on queer subjectivity, affect, and culture.

How is the human body, in its diversity, portrayed on screen ? And how may filmic languages—from cinema to new media—be affected by the multifaceted experience of our embodied dimension ? In this course we will examine the intricate relationship between cinema and the body as a paradigmatic way to study how moving images are seen, made, and experienced today. From a plurality of standpoints (historical, formal, theoretical) and across a wide range of corpus (documentary, fiction, experimental, new media, art cinema), we will ask ourselves how different filmic discourses are able to represent and explore the creative faculties but also the darker sides of the body, its gestures, desires, impulses or drives. We will investigate how they can account for the cognitive, gender, cultural, technological and political revolutions associated with the body throughout history, with a particular emphasis on contemporary contexts of new images, mediascapes, and practices. Focusing on several key-sites of the (post-)modern condition—cosmopolitan/metropolitan experiences, narrative technolo-gies, pluralist (dis-)identifications, tansmedial mobility, immanent temporalities—the course will offer rich critical opportunities to make sense of contemporary bodies via moving images, and vice versa. Theoretical/critical works read in class will include texts by Bergson, Epstein, Pierce, Deleuze, Bellour, Elsaesser, Doane, Lastra… The course is organized around lectures/seminars and film screenings. Students are expected to participate fully by carrying out assessed readings and writing assignments, actively involve in classroom discussions/viewings, and give scheduled oral presentations. FILM GU4951 NEW MEDIA ART. 3 points. The rapid democratization of technology has led to a new wave of immersive storytelling that spills off screens into the real world and back again. These works defy traditional constraints as they shift away from a one-to-many to a many-to-many paradigm, transforming those formerly known as the audience from passive viewers into storytellers in their own right. New opportunities and limitations offered by emergent technologies are augmenting the grammar of storytelling, as creators wrestle with an ever-shifting digital landscape. New Media Art pulls back the curtain on transmedial works of fiction, non-fiction, and emergent forms that defy definition. Throughout the semester we'll explore projects that utilize Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and the Internet of Things, alongside a heavy-hitting selection of new media thinkers, theorists, and critics. The course will be co-taught as a dialogue between artistic practice and new media theory. Lance Weiler, a new media artist and founder of Columbia’s Digital Storytelling Lab, selected the media artworks; Rob King, a film and media historian, selected the scholarly readings. It is in the interaction between these two perspectives that the course will explore the parameters of emerging frontiers in media art and the challenges these pose for existing critical vocabularies.
