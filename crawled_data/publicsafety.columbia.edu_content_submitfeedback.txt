Submit a Public Safety Service Complaint: If you are displeased with an interaction that you have had with Public Safety personnel or with any other Columbia affiliate including a student, staff, or faculty member, you can file a formal complaint by using the Service Complaint Form, which is available online. Service complaints can be submitted anonymously if you prefer. However, although complaints submitted anonymously will be investigated vigorously, anonymous complainants will not receive a follow-up regardless of the outcome. Once a complaint is submitted, you will receive an email with potential next steps provided that you did not submit the form anonymously. Submit a service complaint form here.
