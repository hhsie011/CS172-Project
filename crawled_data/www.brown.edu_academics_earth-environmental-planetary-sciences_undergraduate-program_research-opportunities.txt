Undergraduate students participate actively in this research through independent research projects or employment involving field work, laboratory experiments, or theoretical computer modeling. Students get meaningful hands-on experience as well as a chance to assess various career options. It is common for student research to be published. Examples of recent student research projects: Modeling 2-D seismic velocity structure of the mantle wedge and its implications on seismic tomography interpretation 3-D reconstruction of sediment deformation processes during footprint formation Insights from quartz cathodoluminescence zoning into the crystallization of a late-orogenic granite pluton in southeastern New England Volatiles in submarine intra-transform lavas Flash weakening of serpentinite at seismic slip rates Recent abnormal shell growth in the northern quahog in Narragansett Bay Carbon cycling in the most recent Hothouse Earth: Compound specific carbon isotope analysis of Eocene Green River strata from the Uinta Basin Finding nature's stories: A model of place-based education The effect of melt migration on the thermal structure at convergent plate boundaries Species differences in nitrate reductase activity in a northeastern temperate forest A bioassay for the devil's element: Understanding phosphorus availability in soils Examining changes in lithology at Galapagos core site CDH3 using XRF (X-ray fluorescence) Volatiles in submarine intra-transform lavas People Undergraduate Studies What is Geology?
