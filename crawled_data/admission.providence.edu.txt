At Providence College, we look beyond our own perspectives to gain a fuller image of truth. We find new vantage points to see connections between whole networks of ideas. We arrive at answers (and usually more questions) through dialogue, excelling together in ways one mind can’t alone. A liberal arts education is an invitation to excel in scholarship, creativity, and character. Providence College students are defined by excellence because they define — and redefine — it every day.
