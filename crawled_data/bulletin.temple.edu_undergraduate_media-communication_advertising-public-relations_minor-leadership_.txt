The goal of the Leadership Minor is to help students to understand that leadership is a communication and relational process, not a position. Viewed that way, leadership requires responsible, thoughtful reflection and action at all societal levels. That also requires competencies in being self-aware, in managing teams, in making ethical decisions, and leading with an intent to engender positive change.
