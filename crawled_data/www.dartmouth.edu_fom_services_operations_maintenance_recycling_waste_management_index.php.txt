Most of our recycling from campus buildings goes through a single-stream system known as Zero-Sort. Additionally, we recycle construction and demolition (C&D) materials, cardboard, electronics, metal, uniforms, universal waste—e.g., batteries and light bulbs—and tires. Dartmouth Composts Currently, Dartmouth composts about 400 tons of food waste annually. The Dartmouth Recycles crew transports food waste from dining venues to a compost compactor, and our waste hauler then transports the compactor to the Lebanon Landfill where it is placed in windrows for composting. The composted material is spread as a top layer over landfill areas and planted with grass seed. As Dartmouth improves its recycling and composting rate, more trash is diverted from the landfill.
