June 09, 2016 On June 9-12, architects and filmmakers gathered at the King Ghazi Hotel in downtown Amman for a program of film screenings and conversations on cinema, cities, counter-narratives, and subjectivity. This public program, organized by Studio-X Amman, explores how independent, low-budget, hybrid and personal cinema from the past two decades has produced representations and narratives that rewrite the histories and lived experiences of cities. In this selection of films curated by Rasha Salti, an independent curator and writer, the artists and filmmakers used the medium of film and the language of personal, hybrid and sometimes experimental cinema, to produce an image of that which is excluded from visibility. In blending institutional and private family archives, speaking in the first person or creating a stage for the voice of those not usually heard, foregrounding the fictional power of documentary and lacing it with fiction, from these films surface counter-narratives, sometimes inhibited and other times prohibited, sometimes neglected, ignored or simply forgotten. The film screenings were followed by conversations with filmmakers, architects and historians. Participating speakers and discussants included: Mona Assaad, independent filmmaker, Neighbors (Giran) Sarah Francis, independent filmmaker, Birds of September (Tuyur Ayloul) Omnia Khalil, participatory planner, urban anthropologist, and doctoral candidate in Anthropology, Graduate Center of the City University of New York Arya Lalloo, independent filmmaker, Jeppe on a Friday Khaled Malas, architect and doctoral candidate at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University Mpho Matsipa, architect, researcher at the University of Witwatersrand, and Adjunct Assistant Professor and Curator of Studio-X Johannesburg at Columbia GSAPP Elis Mendoza, architect, researcher, activist, and doctoral candidate in Architecture History and Theory at Princeton University Rasha Salti, independent film and visual arts curator and writer Tags Amman Public Amman Education Columbia Commitments: Arts and Ideas News May 26, 2022 Book Talk: A Slave Between Empires May 25, 2022 Alumni Spotlight: Gonzalo Mena May 24, 2022 Paris Center Stories: Translating Theater and Acting in Paris, Summer 2022 May 18, 2022 Book Talk: Your Sons Are at Your Service May 18, 2022 Academics from Chilean University UAI Visit Columbia to Strengthen Relationship with SEAS Columbia Global CentersAmman / Beijing / Istanbul / Mumbai / Nairobi / Paris / Rio / Santiago / Tunis Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
