Software includes in-demand titles that students can’t easily access by other means. When connected to the virtual lab you will be running a Windows 10 PC that works much like an on-campus lab computer. Click the "Register tab" or use this link to request access. (You will usually hear back within one business day.) Access information Click the "Register tab" or use this link to request access and wait to receive a confirmation email with instructions. (You will usually hear back within one business day.) Access the vLab through https://library.desktop.upenn.edu. From there, you can download VMware Horizon client program or use HTML access. HTML access is the simplest way to use the virtual lab; everything works right in your web browser. The Horizon client provides more functionality including the ability to connect to resources on your local computer, including disc drives and USB devices. Saving your work You need to save your work by uploading to Google Drive, Canvas or whatever cloud-based storage you normally use. Each time you log in, you get a brand new session. You will not be able to pick up where you left off or leave your work saved on the VLab computer.
