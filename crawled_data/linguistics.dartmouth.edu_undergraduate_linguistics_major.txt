The Linguistics Major may be modified with another program of study, but the Computational Linguistics Major may not. Because the Computational Linguistics Major is a combination of linguistics and computational coursework, students may not major in both Linguistics and Computational Linguistics, nor is there a minor in Computational Linguistics. Linguistics Major Students who pursue a major in linguistics should take ten courses beyond LING 1. Linguistics majors should also take two foreign language courses in addition to the College's foreign language requirement. They may fulfill this requirement by taking two courses in a single language beyond the first-year level in the same language as used to fulfill the College requirement. Alternatively, one or both of these additional language courses may be in a different language not closely related to the first. LING 8 and LING 35 may be used to fulfill one or both of these additional language courses; if used in this way, however, LING 8 and LING 35 may not also be counted towards the major. The ten courses for the Linguistics Major should be constituted as follows: LING 22 LING 20 or LING 21 One course in the 30s (LING 33 or LING 35) At least three additional courses in the 20s or 30s (LING 20, 21, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 33, 35) Four more courses in Linguistics, including one that satisfies the requirement for a culminating activity, which may be met in one of three ways: Completing a senior Honors Thesis (LING 86 - LING 87) Taking an advanced seminar in linguistics (LING 80) Carrying out a one or two term Independent Study project (LING 85) Of the courses not used to satisfy the culminating activity requirement under 5, students may substitute up to two courses from the following, in consultation with an advisor: Anthropology 9, French 35, Philosophy 6, Philosophy 34, and/or Russian 48. Certain courses not listed here, such as advanced seminars in various departments, may also be counted towards the major with permission of the Chair. Majors may not include more than two courses designated as LING 11.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Linguistics Undergraduate Overview About Linguistics Learning Outcomes Courses Major/Minor Modified Minor Computational Linguistics Major Undergraduate Research Opportunities Student Presentations and Publications Honors Past Honors Theses Awards and Prizes Alumni and their Career Paths Foreign Study Research Overview Faculty Research Recent Grants Undergraduate Research Opportunities Student Presentations and Publications Linguistics Lab Research Roundtable Linguistic Discovery (Dartmouth journal) DARLA: Dartmouth Linguistic Automation News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
