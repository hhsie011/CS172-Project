Dean Appling and his group manage all space in the college and oversee and approve all college-related renovations and building projects, including faculty recruitment space needs, teaching and research labs, and shared facilities. On the research side, the office manages the indirect cost budget (see below), provides matching funds for multi-investigator grants, oversees college core facilities, and runs the CNS Catalyst Grant competition. The Strategic Research Initiatives arm of the office provides grant proposal development support to faculty college-wide. We coordinate several internal funding programs supporting faculty, graduate students, and postdocs in CNS. We work with teams of faculty to identify and develop multi-investigator center grant and institutional training grant proposals. We also offer one-on-one consultations for individual investigator grant proposals. Finally, we coordinate the nomination process for limited submission research awards throughout the year. CNS Indirect Cost Policy The College of Natural Sciences receives from the University 25% of all indirect costs (IDC) generated from the research grants that were awarded to CNS PIs in the previous calendar year. Each September, the college returns on average 50% of its share back to the departments, centers, and ORUs that generated the IDC. Indirect costs are used to offset overhead expenses associated with the sponsored research conducted in academic departments and University Research Units. Additional information on CNS IDC policy and use of IDC can be found here. Please note: CNS policy does not allow indirect costs to be returned to individual PIs or faculty for their own use.
