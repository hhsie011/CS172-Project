In fact, in 2019, Forbes ranked UCLA the No. 4 best value university in the nation, considering price, average student debt, future earnings, education quality and other factors. 2022–2023 Estimated Undergraduate Student Budget Some or all instruction for all or part of the Academic Year may be delivered remotely. Tuition and fees have been set regardless of the method of instruction and will not be refunded in the event instruction occurs remotely for any part of the Academic Year. Beginning fall 2022, University of California (UC) tuition for each incoming undergraduate class will remain flat until the student graduates, for up to six years. Known as the UC Tuition Stability Plan, this plan provides unprecedented predictability for families in helping to manage their educational costs. By minimizing unexpected increases in tuition and reducing uncertainty about the cost of their education, students and families are able to better calculate and plan for the costs of attending UCLA. For more details about the UC Tuition Stability Plan, please visit the University of California website. Figures for tuition and fees represent currently approved or proposed amounts and may not be final. Final approved tuition and fee levels may differ from the amounts presented.

Residency Requirements and Tuition As the nation’s premier public research university, UCLA is grateful to the people of California. Residents contribute to state education funding and are responsible for the continued existence of this special California institution. As a result, the tuition you pay depends on your residency status, which is determined by a specific process. California residency for tuition is not the same as other definitions of California residency. If your parents are not California residents, then the financial independence requirement makes it extremely difficult for most undergraduates to qualify for classification as a California resident at UCLA. This includes students from community colleges and other post-secondary institutions within the state. Transfer students who were classified as residents of California at their previous school should not assume that they’ll be classified as residents here. If you’re unsure whether you qualify for in-state tuition at UCLA, visit the UC’s residency requirements page for more information.
