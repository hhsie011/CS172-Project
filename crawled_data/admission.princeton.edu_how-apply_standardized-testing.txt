As a result, we will continue to operate in a test optional environment for first-year applicants applying during the 2022-23 cycle for Princeton’s Class of 2027. Students who opt to apply to Princeton without an ACT or SAT will not be at a disadvantage in our process. We will continue with a holistic evaluation of each application and will continue to assess testing requirements for students applying after next year’s cycle. The process for transfer applicants will also be test optional during the 2022-23 cycle and will be reassessed for those applying after next year’s cycle. Please see COVID-19 Update for changes to the application cycle. As with previous years, we do not require the submission of SAT Subject Tests. If you chose to sit for a Subject Test (prior to January/June 2021) and wish to submit the score, you may do so. Please note: the College Board eliminated SAT Subject Tests in January 2021 for domestic students and in June 2021 for international students. Please know that standardized testing is but one element of our comprehensive and holistic application review process. We employ no minimum test scores for admission; rather, the entirety of a student’s background is considered in context. Additionally we do not require applicants to submit the optional writing section of the SAT or ACT (the SAT Essay or ACT Writing Test). For those who choose to submit testing, we allow applicants to use the score choice feature of the SAT and accept only the highest composite score of the ACT, but we encourage the submission of all test scores. Note on additional testing: If you sat for an AP or IB test, we recommend that you self-report all of your AP or IB scores on your application. For those who do submit standardized test scores, you must submit your SAT and/or ACT scores to Princeton directly from the testing firms. Testing Deadlines Students taking standardized tests in December or later should have their scores sent directly to Princeton. Please see COVID-19 Update for complete changes to the application cycle. Transfer applicants who choose to sit for the test must complete all SAT testing by the March test date. All ACT testing must be completed by the February test date.
