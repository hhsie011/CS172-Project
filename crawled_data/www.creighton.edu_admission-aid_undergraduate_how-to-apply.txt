No fees. We’re excited you’re thinking about joining us at Creighton. If you’re ready to apply, you can submit your undergraduate application to our admissions office in one of two ways: The Creighton Application—a streamlined application for students who do not plan to apply to other schools via the Common Application. OR The Common Application—for students applying to multiple schools via the Common Application. Only complete either the Creighton Application or the Common Application. Please do not submit both. All students who apply to Creighton are automatically considered for general merit-based scholarships, including University Awards, Founders Awards and Magis Awards. Scholarships are awarded on a rolling basis. Creighton General Application Common App Fall 2022 Test-Optional Update Since many students haven’t been able to take the ACT or SAT this year, we’ve adjusted our test-optional policy to be more flexible. We don’t want you to pause your college search while waiting for an upcoming test date. Apply to Creighton as a test-optional applicant. Then, if you are able to take a test in the coming months and want your application to be re-reviewed for merit scholarships with the test score, you will be able to do so through the December testing dates. In fact, we will review and award scholarships based on the highest possible scholarship outcome. If you send scores after admission that would improve your scholarship award, we will re-evaluate. If scores are sent after admission that would negatively affect your scholarship decision, no change will be made. Application Requirements for All Applicants To be considered for admission to Creighton, please submit the materials listed below: A completed application for undergraduate admission This can be our own online application or the Common Application. We have no preference between the two. Use whichever one makes the most sense for you. Your official high school transcript, including the scale on which you were graded, sent directly from your high school Your ACT or SAT exam scores*, either official or self-reported; writing portion not considered *For students who are choosing to apply test-optional, ACT/SAT exam scores are not required at the time of application for admission. Students are able to self-report their scores via a form in their student portal. Official ACT or SAT exam scores will be required of all students at the time of enrollment. (ACT school code: 2444; SAT school code: 6121) A high school counselor evaluation If your counselor completes the Secondary School Report from the Common Application, this fulfills the requirement. Essay or personal statement This is your chance to demonstrate your writing potential while allowing the Admissions Committee to get to know you better. If you are completing the Common Application, you do not need an additional personal statement or essay; simply use the one included in the Common Application. Optional: your resume, and/or letters of recommendation written by one of your teachers, coaches, counselors, or mentors, attesting to your academic and social preparedness to study at Creighton. Unsure of what items you still need to submit? Check your student portal. Transfer Student Requirements In addition to the materials listed above, all transfer students applying to Creighton should submit the following: All of your official college and/or university transcripts Additionally, the official high school transcript must be the official final high school transcript. These must come directly from the institution in order to be considered official. Have a College Official (i.e. dean of students, registrar, academic advisor) submit a College Official’s Report This verifies that a student is in good academic and disciplinary standing with their current institution. This requirement is in lieu of the counselor recommendation, which is not required for transfer students. For more information about transfer requirements, please visit our transfer students page. Homeschooled Student Requirements A letter of recommendation from a non-family member (coach, employer, community leader, etc). International Students Requirements Please visit the International Student Admissions Requirements page for full details about admission and application requirements for international students. How to Submit Documents Documents may be submitted via standard mail or electronically. Note that some documents (transcripts, recommendations, scores) will not be considered official documents if submitted by the student. For example, a high school transcript must come from a school official, not the submitting student. Submit document electronically If you submit documents via standard mail, our mailing address is: Creighton University Attn: Undergraduate Admissions Office 2500 California Plaza Omaha, NE 68178 If you have questions or would like to schedule a personalized visit at any stage during the application process, please get in touch with one of our admissions counselors. Be sure to check out our FAQ page if you have additional questions. Kelsey Jackson, Physics ’21, Sioux City, IA “I visited Creighton just before my senior year of high school and set up a meeting with someone in the Physics Department just to ask a few questions. They ended up sending me to see Dr. Nichols and a quick Q&A session turned into an hour of sitting around and talking with him about why I loved physics, a tour of the labs, and a job offer!” Image Take the Next Step Apply now if you’re ready, schedule a visit to see Creighton in person, or get in touch with one of our admissions counselors if you have more questions.
