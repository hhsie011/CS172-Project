This study is also applied to many problems, both internal to mathematics and arising in other disciplines such as physics, cryptography, and finance. Majors begin by taking either Honors mathematics or the calculus sequence. Students who do not take MATH UN1207 Honors Mathematics A and MATH UN1208 HONORS MATHEMATICS B normally take MATH UN2010 LINEAR ALGEBRA in the second year. Following this, majors begin to learn some aspects of the main branches of modern mathematics: algebra, analysis, and geometry; as well as some of their subdivisions and hybrids (e.g., number theory, differential geometry, and complex analysis). As the courses become more advanced, they also become more theoretical and proof-oriented and less computational. Aside from the courses offered by the Mathematics Department, cognate courses in areas such as astronomy, chemistry, physics, probability, logic, economics, and computer science can be used toward the major. A cognate course must be a 2000-level (or higher) course and must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies. In general, a course not taught by the Mathematics Department is a cognate course for the mathematics major if either (a) it has at least two semesters of calculus as a stated prerequisite, or (b) the subject matter in the course is mathematics beyond an elementary level, such as PHIL UN3411 SYMBOLIC LOGIC, in the Philosophy Department, or COMS W3203 DISCRETE MATHEMATICS, in the Computer Science Department. Another requirement for majors is participation in an undergraduate seminar, usually in the junior or senior year. Applied math majors must take the undergraduate seminar in both the junior and senior year. In these seminars, students gain experience in learning an advanced topic and lecturing on it. In order to be eligible for departmental honors, majors must write a senior thesis. Courses for First-Year Students The systematic study of mathematics begins with one of the following three alternative calculus and linear algebra sequences: Course List Code Title Points MATH UN1101 - MATH UN1102 - MATH UN1201 - MATH UN1202 - MATH UN2010 CALCULUS I and CALCULUS II and Calculus III and CALCULUS IV and LINEAR ALGEBRA OR MATH UN1101 - MATH UN1102 - MATH UN1205 - MATH UN2010 CALCULUS I and CALCULUS II and Accelerated Multivariable Calculus and LINEAR ALGEBRA OR MATH UN1101 - MATH UN1102 - MATH UN1207 - MATH UN1208 CALCULUS I and CALCULUS II and Honors Mathematics A and HONORS MATHEMATICS B Credit is allowed for only one calculus and linear algebra sequence. Calculus I, II is a standard course in single-variable differential and integral calculus; Calculus III, IV is a standard course in multivariable differential and integral calculus; Accelerated Multivariable Calculus is an accelerated course in multivariable differential and integral calculus. While Calculus II is no longer a prerequisite for Calculus III, students are strongly urged to take it before taking Calculus III. In particular, students thinking of majoring or concentrating in mathematics or one of the joint majors involving mathematics should take Calculus II before taking Calculus III. Note that Calculus II is a prerequisite for Accelerated Multivariable Calculus, and both Calculus II and Calculus III are prerequisites for Calculus IV. The third sequence, Honors Mathematics A- B, is for exceptionally well-qualified students who have strong Advanced Placement scores. It covers multivariable calculus (MATH UN1201 Calculus III- MATH UN1202 CALCULUS IV) and linear algebra (MATH UN2010 LINEAR ALGEBRA), with an emphasis on theory. Advanced Placement The department grants 3 credits for a score of 4 or 5 on the AP Calculus AB exam provided students complete MATH UN1102 CALCULUS II or MATH UN1201 Calculus III with a grade of C or better. The department grants 3 credits for a score of 4 on the AP Calculus BC exam provided students complete MATH UN1102 CALCULUS II or MATH UN1201 Calculus III with a grade of C or better. The department grants 6 credits for a score of 5 on the AP Calculus BC exam provided students complete MATH UN1201 Calculus III or MATH UN1205 Accelerated Multivariable Calculus MATH UN1207 Honors Mathematics A with a grade of C or better. Students can receive credit for only one calculus sequence. Placement in the Calculus Sequences Calculus I Students who have essentially mastered a precalculus course and those who have a score of 3 or less on an Advanced Placement (AP) exam (either AB or BC) should begin their study of calculus with MATH UN1101 CALCULUS I. Calculus II and III Students with a score of 4 or 5 on the AB exam, 4 on the BC exam, or those with no AP score but with a grade of A in a full year of high school calculus may begin with either MATH UN1102 CALCULUS II or MATH UN1201 Calculus III. Note that such students who decide to start with Calculus III may still need to take Calculus II since it is a requirement or prerequisite for other courses. In particular, they MUST take Calculus II before going on to MATH UN1202 CALCULUS IV. Students with a score of 5 on the BC exam may begin with Calculus III and do not need to take Calculus II. Those with a score of 4 or 5 on the AB exam or 4 on the BC exam may receive 3 points of AP credit upon completion of Calculus II with a grade of C or higher. Those students with a score of 5 on the BC exam may receive 6 points of AP credit upon completion of Calculus III with a grade of C or higher. Accelerated Multivariable Calculus Students with a score of 5 on the AP BC exam or 7 on the IB HL exam may begin with MATH UN1205 Accelerated Multivariable Calculus. Upon completion of this course with a grade of C or higher, they may receive 6 points of AP credit. Honors Mathematics A Students who want a proof-oriented theoretical sequence and have a score of 5 on the BC exam may begin with MATH UN1207 Honors Mathematics A, which is especially designed for mathematics majors. Upon completion of this course with a grade of C or higher, they may receive 6 points of AP credit. Transfers Inside the Calculus Sequences Students who wish to transfer from one calculus course to another are allowed to do so beyond the date specified on the Academic Calendar. They are considered to be adjusting their level, not changing their program. However, students must obtain the approval of the new instructor and their advising dean prior to reporting to the Office of the Registrar. Grading No course with a grade of D or lower can count toward the major, interdepartmental major, or concentration. Students who are doing a double major cannot double count courses for their majors. Departmental Honors In order to be eligible for departmental honors, majors must write a senior thesis. To write a senior thesis, students must register for MATH UN3999 Senior Thesis in Mathematics in the fall semester of their senior year. Normally no more than 10% of graduating majors receive departmental honors in a given academic year. Professors Mohammed Abouzaid David A.

MATH UN2015 features linear algebra with a focus on probability and statistics. The course covers the standard linear algebra topics: systems of linear equations, matrices, determinants, vector spaces, bases, dimension, eigenvalues and eigenvectors. It also teaches applications of linear algebra to probability, statistics and dynamical systems giving a background sufficient for higher level courses in probability and statistics. The topics covered in the probability theory part include conditional probability, discrete and continuous random variables, probability distributions and the limit theorems, as well as Markov chains, curve fitting, regression, and pattern analysis. The course contains applications to life sciences, chemistry, and environmental life sciences. No a prior i background in the life sciences is assumed. This course is best suited for students who wish to focus on applications and practical approach to problem solving, rather than abstract mathematics and mathematical proofs. It is recommended to students majoring in engineering, technology, life sciences, social sciences, and economics.
