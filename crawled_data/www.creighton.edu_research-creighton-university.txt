Our faculty publish well-received and highly respected studies across disciplines in all nine of our schools and colleges. The breadth and depth of this activity is constantly growing, but Creighton researchers are especially known for their contributions in medicine, health sciences and policy, biomedical science, neuroscience and economics. Much of our research and scholarship is collaborative between expert faculty and committed students. And when you’re working on these projects—sometimes, as early as your freshman year—you’ll always work directly with faculty, not graduate assistants. More than a third of Creighton’s undergraduate students participate in research before graduation—a main reason why we have been considered by U.S. News & World Report as a Top School for Undergraduate Research/Creative Projects during the lifespan of the category.
