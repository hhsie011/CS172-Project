Dartmouth engineers view the world as a series of interconnected systems, with various feedback loops enhancing or detracting from desired functions. Looking through this lens, researchers can zero in on bottlenecks and find solutions with maximum human-centered impact. A diversity of concentrations is offered with strong synergies between the biomedical, biological and chemical, electrical and computer, energy, and materials engineering research areas. Graduate engineering students are expected to propose a plan of study that supports their interests, potentially including distinctive intellectual paths unconstrained by disciplinary boundaries and enriched by interdisciplinary synergies. The following research sub-areas have been strategically chosen to address key challenges and opportunities and are supported by leading faculty in their fields. On This Page Cybersecurity & Information Systems Energy Systems & Infrastructure Engineered Systems for Extreme & Changing Environments Fluid Mechanics & Thermal Systems Operations Analysis & Management Systems Modeling & Optimization Cybersecurity & Information Systems The ability to decipher patterns in digital behaviors has implications in areas as disparate as cybersecurity, stock-market fraud, and counterterrorism. For better or for worse, more and more of our behaviors are being tracked and collated. That information not only has obvious marketing potential, but also can tell us about the daily patterns of people in society, and how we might improve information systems and design solutions for today's interconnected digital world. Research Subfields Artificial intelligence Cloud computing and embedded systems Computational social systems Human thought and behavior Network analysis and management Platform economics and strategy Soft computing Researchers George Cybenko Geoffrey G. Parker Minh Q. Phan Laura Ray Eugene Santos Jr. Stephen Taylor Energy Systems & Infrastructure Understanding cyber-physical energy systems and their integration is critical to improving sustainability and resilience in interdependent smart infrastructures. Dartmouth is active in research that supports the design, planning, and operations of large scale engineering systems involving energy, water, structures, transportation and industrial activities. Research Subfields Industrial energy management Energy storage and conversion devices Logistics and transportation Multisector dynamics Nanoscale energy transport Smart power grids Sustainable design Thermoelectric management Researchers Alexis R. Abramson Benoit Cushman-Roisin Amro M. Farid Klaus Keller Weiyang (Fiona) Li Vicki V. May Erin Mayfield Peter J. Robbie Vikrant Vaze Engineered Systems for Extreme & Changing Environments Rapid biological, physical, chemical, and social changes in a variety of the world's regions are fundamentally altering climate, weather, and ecosystems with profound global impacts. Now is an unprecedented time to use new technologies to investigate previously inaccessible realms and form international partnerships. Recent research involves scientific traverses across Antarctica, expeditions in the Arctic, and ice coring in both polar regions. Research Subfields Arctic ecosystem dynamics Climate change mitigation and adaptation High-resolution mapping Sustainability, resilience, and reconfigurability Terrain identification Transport and dispersion of environmental contamination Researchers Mary R. Albert Benoit Cushman-Roisin Amro M. Farid Klaus Keller Colin R. Meyer Donald K. Perovich Laura Ray Helene Seroussi Fluid Mechanics & Thermal Systems The world is filled with engineering applications that make use of the principles of fluid mechanics and thermal systems—industrial and building energy efficiency, environmental turbulence and ecosystem dynamics, and climate change to name a few. Dartmouth researchers are engaged in analytical, computational and experimental investigations to solve a range of problems involving heat, mass and momentum transfer. Research Subfields Coupled mechanical and thermal phenomena Environmental fluid mechanics Sea ice geophysics Snow and ice mechanics Researchers Alexis R. Abramson Mary R. Albert Benoit Cushman-Roisin Colin R. Meyer Donald K. Perovich Operations Analysis & Management The behavior and performance of complex real-world systems is shaped by interactions between multiple decision-makers. Operations research at Dartmouth has applications in energy, transportation, education, healthcare, design and manufacturing, drawing from tools in optimization, human and machine learning, and platform strategies. Research Subfields Design thinking Human-centered design Market economics Product innovation and development Supply chains Researchers Amro M. Farid Wesley J. Marrero Elizabeth L. Murnane Geoffrey G. Parker Peter J. Robbie Eugene Santos Jr. Vikrant Vaze Systems Modeling & Optimization Multi-component systems—such as communication networks, industrial processes, interacting teams of robots, and influences on human behavior—can produce unexpected emergent properties that make the overall system tough to model. "Many of the systems we are building, the human user and social aspects of those systems are really critical. Being able to incorporate the human as part of the engineering system will be even more important as we move ahead.” —George Cybenko, Dorothy and Walter Gramm Professor of Engineering Research Subfields Autonomous robot teams Cognitive decision processes Decision making Healthcare analytics Human-computer interaction Market structure and performance Software agent systems Sound wave propagation Researchers George Cybenko Amro M.
