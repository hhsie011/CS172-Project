Funding College Work-Study (CWS) subsidizes some student jobs with federal and institutional funds The employing department pays 40% of wages while the College Work-Study Program funds the remaining 60%. CWS benefits both the employer and the student Employers only have to pay a portion of the CWS student’s payroll Students may credit their CWS income as financial aid to reduce their Student Contribution and increase their eligibility for future need-based aid Procedure Student eligibility for employment under CWS is based on financial need, as determined by the FAFSA Pay rates and job descriptions for CWS-funded positions are identical to those for similar positions not funded through CWS Students authorized for CWS receive preference in hiring, so it’s best to indicate interest in CWS when completing the FAFSA Students who are eligible for CWS will be notified of their eligibility on their Financial Aid Award Funds for CWS are limited, and not all students who are eligible can be placed on the program Students should begin their job search and arrange interviews as early as possible during the first week of the semester A great resource to find both CWS and non-CWS jobs is the Student Job Board Remember, many part-time jobs on-campus and in the Ames area are not funded through CWS, so CWS funds may be exhausted by the time a student finds a position Programs America Reads/America CountsAmerica Reads/America Counts is a program that employs Iowa State work-study eligible students to tutor local students in partnership with Central Iowa schools and afterschool programs.
