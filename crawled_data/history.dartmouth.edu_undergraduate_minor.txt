GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION For the purposes of the minor requirements applicable to the class of 2023 and earlier, most courses fall into one of four areas: (1) United States (designated US in the course listings); (2) Europe (designated EUR in the course listings); (3) Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean (designated AALAC in the course listings); or (4) Interregional and Comparative (designated INTER in the course listings below).

Interregional (INTER) CHRONOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION Your seven courses must contain at least two pre-1800 courses. In the course listings, courses fulfilling the pre-1800 requirement are designated <1800. SEMINARS AND COLLOQUIA All Minors must complete one course involving advanced historical practice which will represent the culminating experience. Students meet this requirement by enrolling in HIST 96, a small course (normally capped at 12) that allows students to work closely with a faculty member and to produce a final project that represents either original research in primary sources or (with colloquia) a historiographical contribution to the existing scholarly literature. FIELD OF CONCENTRATION All Minors are encouraged to identify an area of concentration within the broad field of History. Establishing a critical mass of classes each related to a geographic, chronological or thematic concentration will enhance a student's ability to develop expertise and make connections. One of these must be a culminating experience in the form of a HIST 96. LIMITS AND EXCLUSIONS At least five History courses must be taken in residence at Dartmouth College, one of them being HIST 96. HIST 7 (First-Year Seminar) and History 99 (Honors Thesis) may not be counted toward the Minor. Students may not include more than two of the following courses: HIST 1, 2 or 3. Students may not use more than two independent study courses (HIST 97) in satisfying the requirements of the Minor. At most one course in the minor may be taken under the NRO. Minor GPA is figured on all History courses taken. The Department will consider approving transfer credits for History majors/minors and non-majors only for History courses taken at institutions with which Dartmouth College has institutional exchange programs.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of History Undergraduate Overview History FAQs for First Year and Transfer Students How to Declare a Major or Minor in History Major Modified Major Minor Transfer Credit Policy Course Descriptions First-Year Seminars Introductory Africa, Asia, Latin America & The Caribbean (AALAC) Europe (EUR) Interregional & Comparative (INTER) United States (US) Seminars & Colloquia Independent Study & Honors Course Schedule 2021-2022 Schedule 2022-2023 Schedule 2023-2024 Schedule Course Syllabi Honors Thesis Program General Timeline Guidelines for the Class of 2022 Guidelines for the Class of 2023 Honors Theses By Year Phi Alpha Theta Honors Society Prizes After Graduation Alumni Update Research Overview Faculty Research Initiatives Dartmouth History Institute Student Research Initiatives and Resources The Dartmouth Vietnam Project History Librarian Research Funding Resources Undergraduate Research Database Student Class Projects Foreign Study News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
