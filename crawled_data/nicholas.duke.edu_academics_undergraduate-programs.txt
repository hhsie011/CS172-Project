Majors & Minors Our broad range of majors and minors gives you the flexibility to follow your interests and career goals. Earth & Climate Sciences The Earth and Climate Science major allows students to immerse themselves in the study of the Earth’s climate system – including the solid earth, the hydrosphere, the atmosphere and the biosphere – while also gaining solid foundational knowledge of earth sciences more broadly and retaining the option to focus on geosciences. Environmental Sciences & Policy If you’re passionate about the environment, love interdisciplinary learning, and want to use the skills and knowledge you acquire at Duke to blaze new and better approaches to climate change and other environmental issues, these are the majors for you. Marine Science & Conservation Covering nearly three-quarters of the Earth, our oceans regulate the climate, provide food for billions of people, and are home to countless species and vast resources. If you’re passionate about understanding and solving the myriad of issues confronting our oceans and maritime communities, these majors are for you. Certificates In addition to our degree programs, we offer undergraduate certificate programs to enhance your academic experience. Certificate in Energy & Environment A six-course certificate program for Duke undergraduates interested in the breadth of issues that confront our society in its need for clean, affordable and reliable energy Main Campus Certificate in Sustainability Engagement A customizable certificate program for undergraduates designed to facilitate learning and research that confronts the interconnections between environmental, economic and social aspects of sustainability Main Campus Other Academic Opportunities Career and Academic Innovation and Research Network of Scholars (CAIRNS) The Career and Academic Innovation and Research Network of Scholars Program provides Duke University undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds with mentoring and training in support of environmental careers. Graduation with Distinction The Graduation with Distinction program recognizes undergraduates who demonstrate academic excellence through the successful completion of a senior thesis based on a substantive independent research project evaluated by a committee of three faculty members. Duke Marine Lab: Open to All Majors For a summer or a semester, you can experience island living and hands-on learning, earnest faculty, small classes, low faculty-to-student ratios and the camaraderie of a close-knit community. Students from all disciplines—not just marine science—shape their experience by mixing field courses, lab courses, lectures and research to meet curricular needs and match personal interests. Watch Video Faces of Hope: Three Future Environmental Leaders Who Inspire Us Cameron Oglesby, Anjali Boyd and Avery Davis Lamb are three of the outstanding students the Nicholas School is proud to call its own. Their accomplishments, acumen, energy and passion for bringing about positive change inspire us and leave us just a little bit in awe. Read Story Watch Videos Using Drones to Count Penguin Groups For her independent study during her semester at the Duke Marine Lab, Clara Bird researched penguin populations using imagery from drones. Under the leadership of professor Dave Johnston at the Marine Lab’s Marine Robotics and Remote Sensing Lab, Clara and her classmate submitted their final work for publication. Watch Video Saving Endangered Hummingbirds As an undergraduate, Andrea Kolarova joined the research team led by renowned conservationist Stuart Pimm at the Nicholas School of the Environment. They're working to find ways to save endangered hummingbird species in South America. Watch Video Leading the Charge You’ll find Nicholas School alums pursuing their passion and making positive impacts worldwide. Our programs give them the foundational knowledge and practical skills to become leaders and innovators in a wide array of fields and sectors.
