In its protection efforts, the Trademark Program oversees the registration of Harvard’s trademarks and guards against their unauthorized use by identifying and resolving cases involving the misuse or infringement of Harvard’s trademarks on a worldwide basis. Through its licensing operation, the Trademark Program grants licenses to domestic and international companies to produce and sell Harvard insignia items. The Trademark Program also administers Harvard University’s Use-of-Name policies and guidelines, including its Endorsement Guidelines, which govern the manner in which Harvard schools, departments, units, and the wider Harvard community may use the Harvard name through representations that are appropriate, accurate, and in accord with applicable policies. In addition, the Trademark Program assists the Harvard community with trademark related issues and with requests to have goods produced containing any of Harvard’s trademarks. Richard A. and Susan F.
