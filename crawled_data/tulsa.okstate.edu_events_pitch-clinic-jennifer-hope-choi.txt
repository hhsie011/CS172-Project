As an editor for Bon Appétit, I have read, passed on, and greenlit countless pitches. As a writer who has published in places such as The New York Times, The Atlantic, and BuzzFeed News, I also understand the rigorous process one must undertake to make their pitch stand out from the crowd. In this short workshop, we’ll talk about what makes a pitch shine from the slush pile. We’ll review pitches that sold and pitches that miss the mark and why. We will also discuss your own pitches (submitted in advance) and workshop how to make them stronger. REGISTER HERE Scholarships are available for those with financial need. Apply here.
