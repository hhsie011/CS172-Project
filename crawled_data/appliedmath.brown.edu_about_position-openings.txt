UTAs are an integral part of our teaching effort and play an important role. Responsibilities include assisting with recitation sessions or study sections, holding office hours where students can get guidance on topics arising from the course, and helping review student assignments. Through peer-to-peer engagement, UTAs can play a very positive role in shaping a student’s perspective on the learning and application of applied mathematics. Serving as a UTA can also be a learning experience, developing communication skills and reinforcing one’s own knowledge of course topics. UTAs receive an hourly wage, but we do not currently give course credit for being a UTA. UTA positions are advertised in Workday. Usually, positions are advertised in mid-April for the fall semester, and in mid-November for the spring semester. For the upcoming academic year 2022-2023, UTA job postings will open in mid-April 2022 for positions for the fall semester. Questions about UTA positions, please contact Professor Hui Wang. Questions about the application process, please contact Candida Hall. Brown University is committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive academic global community; as an EEO/AA employer, Brown considers applicants for employment without regard to, and does not discriminate on the basis of, gender, race, protected veteran status, disability, or any other legally protected status.
