Hilles Publication Fund Films Archive History Home > Events Upcoming Events Following Yale’s updated guidance on events and gatherings, we’re happy to now be able to welcome community members who are fully vaccinated and boosted to attend our in-person events. To our friends in the New Haven public: we’ve missed you and we look forward to seeing you—at our new home in the Humanities Quadrangle (HQ) at 320 York Street. For those of you far from New Haven, we will continue to hold some Zoom events and some live-streamed in-person events. If a registration link appears with a listing, that means the event is accessible via Zoom. Welcome back to the Whitney!
