Each year 200 students from Tulane's A. B. Freeman School of Business are divided up into teams to follow 40 small-cap public companies headquartered in six southern states. Teams meet with top management, visit company sites, design financial models, and publish in depth, unbiased investment research reports. A Letter from the Director If you want to get a peek at what the Burkenroad classes have been working on this year, check out the director’s letter which includes Peter Ricchiuti's take on the markets and a summary of the students’ findings.
