Florida Aid The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is needed for state need-based grant and scholarship programs. Veterans and ROTC Yellow Ribbon Grants can help veterans pay for tuition costs that the Post-9/11 GI Bill doesn’t cover. How your financial aid is determined UM will calculate your family’s contribution based on the information you provide on your FAFSA and CSS Profile and subtract it from the full annual cost of attendance. The difference is your total demonstrated financial need.
