All International and Public Affairs concentrators take at least one of these courses, preferably as First Years or Sophomores. Gateway courses introduce students to the type of multidisciplinary analysis that is employed throughout the concentration. These courses introduce students to the basic fundamentals of evidence-based argumentation, and the various styles of analysis that will be encountered throughout the students’ path through the concentration. These courses also emphasize the interaction between theory and practice in the analysis and resolution of societal challenges. Gateway courses cannot be substituted. Students select one course from the list of pre-approved courses. Gateway courses are independent of track selection. It is recommended to take the Gateway course prior to track foundational or elective courses. Electives and seminars cannot be used to fulfill Gateway requirements.
