Because participation in the Co-op Program requires students to be on assignment during regular academic semesters (i.e. spring and/or fall semester) it is the student’s responsibility to understand the eligibility and renewal requirements for any and all awarded financial aid. This includes grants, scholarships or loans. Students should contact the Office of Financial Aid prior to accepting a co-op assignment to ensure that they understand how to remain in compliance. Please follow the links below for current co-op program information regarding the Palmetto Fellows and LIFE Scholarships as posted with the Office of Financial Aid.
