The University's Drupal Cloud web content management system, launched in April 2019, is the new, recommended way to create official websites at Brown. Because the University is currently moving from BrownSites/University Theme to the Drupal Cloud CMS, new BrownSite/University Theme websites are no longer being created. Rebuilding the University's 200+ official websites in the new Drupal Cloud CMS is part of a multi-year effort to rebuild brown.edu.
