OSP drafts, negotiates and signs awards to our subrecipient partners as timely as possible after setting up the prime award. A Subrecipient is named in the UofM’s funded proposal or award to conduct a portion of the project. The Uniform Guidance defines a (§200.93) Subrecipient as a non-federal entity that receives a subaward from a pass-through entity to carry out part of a Federal program but does not include an individual that is a beneficiary of such program. A Subrecipient may also be a recipient of other Federal awards directly from a Federal awarding agency. However, a Subrecipient of the University may also receive a subaward to carry out part of nonfederal programs as well. Projects involving an outgoing subrecipient agreement should include a scope of work, detailed budget, budget justification, and subrecipient commitment form for each subrecipient. Additionally, all partners (subrecipient, vendor, or consultant) are required to register as a vendor with the University of Memphis Tigerbuy online marketplace. To check the status of an outgoing subaward agreement, call/email OSP or navigate to the Award Dashboard (Cayuse My Dashboard), locate the active project under My Awards, and check the Subcontracts tab within the project.
