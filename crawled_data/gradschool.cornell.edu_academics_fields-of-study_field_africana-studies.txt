The Africana Studies Ph.D. program is a small and high quality program designed to expand knowledge production about peoples of African descent and to train future generations of scholars who will deepen and refine the field. Africana Studies also offers an Africana Graduate Minor for Cornell graduate students learn more. An interdisciplinary field of study, Africana Studies embraces the study of people of African ancestry on the African continent and in the United States, the Caribbean, Latin America and the broader diaspora. Toward that end, it is at the forefront of scholarship that both transcends disciplinary fields and brings more powerful explanatory value to issues of race, ethnicity, class, gender, and sexuality. Accordingly, since its inception, Africana Studies has profoundly shaped literature, scholars do not confine the field spatially or temporally in examining the dynamics of change for peoples of African ancestry. As a result, Africana Studies helps students to appreciate cultural and epistemological diversity, multidimensionality, multiple perspectives, and interconnectivity, which are essential for higher education and its production of knowledge and for the world in the 21st Century. Indeed, the diversity of the Cornell University's college system, its strengths in the traditional disciplines and its strong support and encouragement of interdisciplinary work provides students an ideal environment in which to pursue graduate training in this field. Moreover, Cornell now has a critical mass of scholars in the Humanities, Visual and Expressive Culture and Social. Sciences whose work collectively sits on the cutting edge of Africana Studies. Furthermore, our faculty offers regional expertise in Africa, the U.S., the Caribbean and Latin America allowing us to offer a Ph.D. program that is multi-disciplinary and transnational. The Ph.D. program in Africana Studies augments Cornell University’s mission to discover, preserve, and disseminate knowledge. Cornell’s world class libraries makes it possible for its faculty and students to carry out the University’s mission. Important collections on Africa and the diaspora are housed across the nineteen units of the University Library system. In addition, the John Henrik Clarke Africana Library at the Africana Studies and Research Center and its collection of [21,100] volumes focuses on the social and political dimensions of the history and culture of peoples of African ancestry. We seek to enroll students who share the Cornell’s mission and have demonstrated strong research, written and analytical skills either through the completion of an undergraduate thesis or a Master’s degree in the humanities and social sciences. Although the cohort each year will be small, three to four students, we will recruit nationally and internationally for the best students. Successful applicants will help satisfy the future demand for scholars with the rigorous intellectual training that Africana Studies offers. Graduates of this Ph.D. program entering the field of Higher Education will be entering a vibrant and growing labor market for doctorates in Africana Studies. Students with doctoral degrees in Africana Studies will be equally prepared to work in a variety of fields from business to the government.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
