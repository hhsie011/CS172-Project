In response to the growing call to action to support the anti-racism movement and to foster an inclusive community, this thematic discussion series, titled 'Stand in Solidarity: Combating Anti-Asian Racism and Xenophobia', aims to offer support especially to Columbia University‚Äôs Asian, Asian American, and Pacific Islander community during this challenging time. The Series will address the rising violence against Asians and Asian Americans in the U.S., examining the ongoing history of race discrimination that has been employed to distract and divide our communities to protect systematic inequality. The session on May 15 will focus on 'Preparing International Students for Race Relations in the U.S.'. About the Event Most Chinese high school students in China have grown up and come of age as part of the majority in a relatively racial homogeneous society; race may not have been an important marker of identity or have factored into their identities at all. However, not only are these students going to be a minority when they reach the U.S., but they are also walking into a complex and diversified society composed of different races of local students and citizens. For many Chinese students, suddenly becoming a minority within the racialized environment of the U.S. is often a lot to process. They may experience "discomfort" from many different sources, making them more sensitive to their experiences in the U.S. Thus, to help U.S.-bound Chinese students navigate the distressing situation and better adapt to the heightening racial tensions in U.S., we will invite four Chinese and U.S. scholars, teachers, and current students to share their experiences and perspectives, and identify actions and recourses to address discrimination.
