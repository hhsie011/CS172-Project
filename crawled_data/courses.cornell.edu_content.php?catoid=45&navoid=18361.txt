This determination is made regardless of whether or not the student is participating in a brick-and-mortar program or via distance learning. Cornell University uses three primary address types in our Student Information System for the purpose of identifying student location: CUAS: Student Local Residence Hall Assignment (Cornell Assigned) RESI: Student Self-Reported Local Address HOME: Student Self-Reported Address at time of Matriculation At the time of initial enrollment in an educational program, Cornell University defines the location of a student using the self-reported address provided through the application for admission process (HOME). The HOME addresses is loaded into the Student Information System (SIS) at the time of matriculation. If a student completes a residence hall contract with Campus Life, a student is then assigned a location of CUAS. A student may update their location at any time, at which point the student would be assigned a RESI address type. To define the location, we evaluate the address types using a hierarchy of CUAS, RESI, HOME. To update a home or local address: Go to Student Essentials and sign-in using Cornell NetID authentication Choose the green circle labeled Personal Choose Update Addresses Complete the form to update home (HOME) or local (RESI) address Save changes by choosing the Update Address button Back to Top | Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Global Search Courses of Study Search Choose Search Location Select an option Courses Departments & Fields of Study College Items College Content Entire Courses of Study Search Keyword Field Whole Word/Phrase Advanced Search Courses of Study Home Course Descriptions Colleges, Schools, and Units Agriculture and Life Sciences Architecture, Art and Planning Arts and Sciences Athletics and Physical Education Biological Sciences Bowers College of Computing and Information Science Brooks School of Public Policy Continuing Education and Summer Sessions Cornell Tech Division of Nutritional Sciences eCornell Engineering Graduate School Human Ecology Industrial and Labor Relations Law School Officer Education SC Johnson College of Business - Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management - Hotel Administration - Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management Veterinary Medicine My Favorites All courses of study © 2022 Cornell University.
