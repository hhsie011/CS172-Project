Medical services that defend against health emergencies, illnesses and diseases—like annual check-ups, immunizations and screening tests—are considered preventive care. From preventing diseases to diagnosing problems early on, preventive care should be a regular part of your healthcare routine. Expand all Collapse all Prevention Care Are you doing enough? Visit the Preventive Care page of the UnitedHealthcare (UHC) website and generate a checklist of preventive services you may consider based on your age and gender. These may include annual wellness exams, flu shots, colorectal screenings, breast cancer screenings, Hepatitis C screenings and more. Discuss this list with your doctor, and then call UHC to find out which services are covered at 100% if you use in-network providers. You can also find coverage information in the Summary Plan Descriptions (SPDs). It starts with your primary care physician Without a Primary Care Physician (PCP), your ongoing medical care may become less consistent, efficient and personal. A PCP will get to know you and maintain your health history. They’re also your first line of defense in prevention and your teammate in helping to manage a chronic condition. If you don’t have a primary care doctor, find one within the UHC network by using UHC’s directory. You haven’t missed your shot! Ask your doctor about catch-up immunizations that you may have missed, or others that require adult boosters.
