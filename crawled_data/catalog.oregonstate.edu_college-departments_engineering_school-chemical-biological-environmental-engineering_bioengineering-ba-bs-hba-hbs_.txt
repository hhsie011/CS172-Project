Bioengineering is an interdisciplinary field that applies engineering principles and quantitative methods to the development of new and novel biologicals, materials, devices, and processes. In practice, bioengineers address issues surrounding the broad areas of bioprocess, biomedical, and bioenvironmental technology. The bioengineering undergraduate program provides a solid background in biology, chemistry, physics and math, in addition to the engineering sciences. It is organized around three themes: 1. Bioprocessing; 2. Tissue Engineering; and 3. Signals of Life. Upper-level course work in bioengineering includes the analysis and design of processes involving immobilized or suspended microbial cultures and the recovery of therapeutic products from bioreactors, as well as course work in biomedical materials engineering, biomedical engineering principles, biomedical imaging processing, and selected course work in cell engineering, surface analysis, among other topics. All students complete a capstone-design experience that integrates drug and medical device regulation. Bioengineering graduates are prepared to contribute to the rapidly growing sector of bioscience-based industries, and to have the ability to formulate and solve problems pertaining to enzyme and microbial process technologies, mammalian cell culture, and downstream processing in biotechnology. They also generate solutions to problems with medical relevance, including the design of devices and systems to replace lost organ function, deliver therapeutic agents, and otherwise improve human health. Alumni of the bioengineering program will be work-ready engineers, problem solvers, responsible professionals, and interdisciplinary collaborators. Program educational objectives can be found here. Major Code: 298 Identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics. Apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors. Communicate effectively with a range of audiences. Recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts. Function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives. Develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions. Acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies.
