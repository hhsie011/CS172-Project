Students wishing to declare a concentration in BEO should take the following steps: Decide on one of the three BEO Tracks: BEO Economics, BEO Organizational Studies or BEO Entrepreneurship & Technology Management. The three tables below provide a quick reference for recommendations on when to take BEO courses. Refer to each BEO Concentration Track page for detailed course requirements. Begin your BEO Concentration Declaration in ASK – (ASK tutorials) BEO requires that your Course Plan in ASK include all of the courses you will need to meet the BEO requirements. Update your course plan each semester so that it is an accurate reflection of your course progress toward the BEO concentration. Meet with your BEO Faculty Track Advisor and BEO Concentrations Advisors early and often.
