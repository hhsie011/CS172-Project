And yet the names of these places do not appear on any maps. The UNHCR and NGOs have developed ways of running them that are both efficient and absurd. This film explores the land of camps, from Kenya, to Tanzania, Jordan, and the Greece/Macedonia border, as well as at the UNHCR’s headquarters in Geneva. It reveals an immense system that combines humanitarian concerns with the management of undesirables who rich countries want to keep out, whatever the cost. Près de 17 millions de personnes - réfugiés, déplacés ou migrants - vivent dans des camps, un pays virtuel de la taille des Pays Bas. Leur nom ne figurent pourtant sur aucune carte. Le HCR et les ONG y ont développé un système à la fois efficace et absurde. Au Kenya, Tanzanie, Jordanie, à la frontière Grèce/Macédoine, ainsi qu'au siège du HCR à Genève, le film mène l’enquête sur ce gigantesque dispositif qui combine préoccupations humanitaires et gestion des indésirables dont les pays riches ne veulent à aucun prix… Suivie d'une conversation avec l'auteure-réalisatrice Anne Poiret (en français) Un film documentaire d’Anne Poiret 71 minutes SST français Production Quark / ARTE France, 2016 RSVP Upcoming Events Columbia Global CentersAmman / Beijing / Istanbul / Mumbai / Nairobi / Paris / Rio / Santiago / Tunis Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
