Recent Alerts Annual Security and Fire Safety Report Contact Us The Department of Public Safety at St. John’s University has been entrusted to provide a safe and secure environment for the University community. Additionally, the mission of the department includes providing the entire University community, including the extended families, accurate, and timely information to assuage any emergent concerns. The Department of Public Safety headquarters is located on the Queens, NY campus at the ROTC Building/McDonald Center. There are additional Command Centers at our Staten Island and Manhattan campuses. The Department operates 24 hours a day, every day of the year. The Public Safety team provides a variety of law enforcement, security, and other services including safety escorts and StormCard services. The Officers can be seen throughout the campus in marked and unmarked vehicles, scooters, foot patrols, as well as fixed post locations. Our Command Center is staffed 24/7 and utilizes the latest video surveillance and communication equipment. All uniformed Public Safety personnel are licensed by the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services. They receive over 25 hours of annual training in various subjects including crime prevention, diversity and sensitivity awareness, community relations, fire and life safety, and best practices for security. They also receive a working knowledge of all applicable state and federal laws. The Officers and Staff are NYS certified first responders, and certified in First Aid, CPR, and Automated External Defibrillator (AED). There is also several staff and officers that are NYS certified Emergency Medical Technicians. All of our supervisors are certified NYC Fire Safety Directors. Many of our members are former law enforcement officers, and bring a tremendous amount of additional training and experience to the Department. St. John’s Department of Public Safety maintains frequent contact with the local police departments that regularly patrol the perimeter of each campus. Additionally, we partner with various city agencies such as the Fire Department and Office of Emergency Management as well as other state, and federal agencies to insure a safe and secure environment. Equity and Inclusion Initiatives In response to the Equity and Inclusion Council recommendations, the University recently engaged the services of an outside consultant to evaluate the Department of Public Safety’s culture, staffing, operations, workplace, and communication practices. As a result of their review, the Department of Public Safety will collaborate with Human Resources (i) to ensure that behaviors reflecting an embrace of a culture of equity and inclusion; as well as, excellence in community engagement are integrated into Public Safety’s hiring, training and performance management practices for all positions and (ii) on candidate sourcing to identify and attract more diverse talent, screen candidates for community engagement competencies, and support the department in making the best hiring selections. We will update the University community as we implement recommended changes. In our continuing quest to ensure we are providing the best possible service to the University Community, Public Safety has engaged social justice educators to provide the department with equity and inclusion training. We are engaging the same team to provide additional training going forward. In addition to ongoing social justice training, the department will undergo additional customer service training as well. Our Services Timely Warnings In the event a situation arises, a campus-wide Public Safety advisory will be issued through the University's e-mail system to students, faculty, and staff, and it will be posted on stjohns.edu and on MySJU. In certain circumstances, Public Safety may also issue an emergency text and voice message alert and/or utilize the public address system and digital signs on campus to alert our community. Emergency Phone System Clearly marked emergency phones throughout the campuses will summon Public Safety immediately. These are for emergency use only, which can be but are not limited to: car trouble, injury, crime prevention, and need for escort services.
