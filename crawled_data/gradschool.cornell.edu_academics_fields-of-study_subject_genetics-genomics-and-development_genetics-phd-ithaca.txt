Such research utilizes state-of-the-art tools in genetics, genomics, biochemistry, proteomics, cell biology, computational biology, imaging, nanobiotechnology and a variety of in vivo methods to characterize the mechanisms regulating a wide range of biological phenomena. Matriculating students can look forward to joining a creative and supportive community of graduate students and faculty and a challenging program which will prepare them to be independent thinkers and researchers. Our faculty members are first rate scientists passionate about research and training of future scientists. Our graduate students are enthusiastic researchers who are instrumental in the research being done in the Field. They form a tight-knit community that supports and mentors their colleagues. The GGD program includes lecture and laboratory courses, teaching experience, and front-line research with access to the latest technology and equipment. Grant writing and presenting scientific research to a variety of audiences, as well as classroom teaching, are also emphasized. Scientific knowledge acquired and the range of skills developed during their graduate program allow our graduates to choose from a wide variety of careers.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
