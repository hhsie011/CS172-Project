Kingsdale ’65 to help advanced theater students underwrite the costs of creative and/or research projects. Students attending the Theater Department's Foreign Study Program in London may seek Kingsdale Fund support in order to attend additional theatrical productions. PreviousNext ELIGIBILITY Kingsdale Funding is available to all theater majors, modified majors, minors, and other advanced theater students demonstrating sustained participation in Department of Theater activities, as well as all students attending the Theater FSP. Funding recipients are typically in at least their sophomore year. USES AND PARAMETERS Kingsdale grants support expenses directly related to theatrical creative and/or research projects initiated by current students. Examples of appropriate projects for Kingsdale fund support include: Production-related expenses, for student productions Tickets and transportation to see professional productions (including those associated with the FSP or THEA 90) Research supplies for approved student projects Taking classes (on an off-term) to supplement area of study Voice Lessons Support of guest artists for student productions Housing and/or other cost-of-living expenses for off-term theater internships Kingsdale funds are NOT to be used for general professional development purposes (headshots, website design, audition fees, etc), or for the purchase of textbooks or other materials needed for classes. Students must be current undergraduates; expenses incurred after graduating are not eligible for reimbursement. PROPOSALS Please use this application form to submit your proposal. Applications can be submitted via email to the Department Administrator. Proposals must be submitted and approved in advance of any expenses being incurred. Proposals need to be approved by the Director of Theater and the student's major advisor or other appropriate instructor. Advance proposals are NOT required for the following: FSP-related ticket and transportation expenses, up to a $250 per-student limit Edinburgh Fringe-related ticket, transportation, and housing expenses (for students on the FSP), up to a $250 per-student limit THEA 90-related ticket and transportation expenses, up to a $175/student limit REIMBURSEMENTS Kingsdale funds are distributed to students through a reimbursement process. Receipts must be submitted in an organized manner (e-receipts or pdf scans preferred), with the purpose of each expense clearly indicated (no envelopes filled with random indecipherable bits of paper, please!). " Barring special circumstances, receipts must be submitted by the end of the term in which the expense was incurred (exceptions to this policy will be considered only on a case-by-case basis). Reimbursements must be processed within the same fiscal year in which the proposal was submitted and the expense incurred. Students who find the reimbursement system a financial hardship should reach out to Department Administrator to discuss an alternative system of fund distribution.

Theater minors and other advanced theater students have an annual ceiling of $500.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Theater Undergraduate Overview Equity and Inclusivity Peer Advisors and Student Representatives The Major Major Requirements Honors Thesis The Modified Major Modified Major Requirements Modifying another Major with Theater The Minor Minor Requirements Courses: offerings by term Course Descriptions Instructor Permission Courses Independent Study Off-Campus Exchange National Theater Institute For Prospective Students Onstage Overview Get Involved Performing and Auditions Directing and Designing Playwriting Stage Managing The Scene Shop The Costume Shop Now Onstage: Upcoming Productions Season Archives: Past Productions Production Photos About Student Productions Workshops and Full Productions Studio Lab: Exploring Theatrical Boundaries YourSpace: Performance Spaces for Creative Minds Student Work in the time of COVID About MainStage Productions Opportunities Overview Summer Theater Lab: Cultivating New Work VoxLab Frost and Dodd Play Festival New York Theatre Workshop Residency The VOICES Program Experiential Learning with Northern Stage Testimonials Student Funding Opportunities Kingsdale Fund Need-Based Funding Goldner Mini-Fellowship Other funding opportunities Funding for Graduate Studies Internships, Fellowships, and Graduate Programs The Neukom Institute Literary Arts Award in Playwriting Foreign Study News & Events All News and Events MainStage Production News Student Production News Honors Thesis Productions Summer Theater Lab News Faculty News Student News Visiting Artist News Alumni News People Faculty and Staff Visiting Artists Alumni Tell Us Your Story Theater and Performance Studies My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
