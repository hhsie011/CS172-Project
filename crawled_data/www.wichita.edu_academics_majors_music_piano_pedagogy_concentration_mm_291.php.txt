As just a freshman, piano major Patrick Orr won the grand prize in the Kansas City Symphony Young Artist Competition. As the winner of the competition, Orr received the honor of accompanying the Kansas City Symphony in two performances. Orr's interest in the piano began after he watched “Titanic” as a kid and decided to learn how to play the hymn “Nearer My God to Thee.” Curriculum The Master of Music degree—piano pedagogy concentration—requires the completion of a minimum of 33 graduate hours, including two accompanied full-hour degree recitals (one vocal and one instrumental recital in either order).
