Liu: Lamp Bearers (2016 expanded edition) Events Past Event New Book Launch Lydia H. Liu: Lamp Bearers (2016 expanded edition) Share Add to Calendar: Google Yahoo December 23, 2016 3:30 PM - 6:00 PM Columbia Global Centers | Beijing Introduction: Please join us for the celebration of a literary publication spanning almost 40 years. This book is a collection of personal accounts of the avant-garde poetry movement in China (known as Misty Poetry) from the late 1970s through the early 1980s. It bears witness to the voices of poets, artists, and their fellow-travelers by telling the story of a poetic generation. Lamp Bearers is a prose collection. The book brings to light for the first time a wealth of primary documents and photos collected in the course of several decades. Many of its narratives make history almost tangible and touchable again in all its granularity. Some of the valuable sources are drawn from the archives at Run Run Shaw Library of City University of Hong Kong. The book launch will be delivered in Chinese, simultaneous translation or any other form of interpretation will not be provided. Invited guests: Bei Dao, Mang Ke, Huang Rui, Xu Xiao, Shi Baojia, E Fuming, Lydia H.
