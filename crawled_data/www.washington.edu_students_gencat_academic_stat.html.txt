Home Home Students Parents Faculty & Staff Alumni College of Arts and Sciences Statistics B313 Padelford Hall 206-221-4558 Website Faculty Website We study the science of data. This includes tools for designing experiments, modeling and analyzing data to answer scientific questions, and displaying complex relationships. Interesting methodological questions are mostly derived from scientific problems, and the department is highly multi-disciplinary.

Statistics is concerned with procedures for the acquisition, management, exploration and use of information, to learn from experience in situations of uncertainty, and to make decisions under risk. Statistical practice includes: design of experiments and of survey sampling; exploration, summarization and display of observational data; drawing inferences, and assessing their uncertainty; building mathematical models for systems with stochastic components. This program of study leads to the following credentials: Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Statistics Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Statistics: Data Science Recommended Preparation Suggested First-and Second-Year College Courses: MATH 224; one of CSE 142 or CSE 160; STAT 311. Additional courses in the sciences and quantitative methods add strength to this major. Admission Requirements Admission is competitive. Completion of minimum requirements described below does not guarantee admission. All applicants have the right to petition and appeal the department's admission decision. Applications are considered once each academic year and are due on the third Friday in April.

Computing (7-9 credits): For the major in statistics: CSE 142 or CSE 160; either STAT 302 (recommended), CSE 143, or an approved substitute. For the data science option: 9 credits from the following: CSE 142, CSE 143, STAT 302, CSE 160, CSE 163 Statistics (24-27 credits): STAT 311 (highly recommended), or STAT 390, or an approved substitute (STAT 220, STAT 221, or STAT 301 which is seldom allowed); either STAT 340 (highly recommended) or both STAT 394/MATH 394 and STAT 395/MATH 395. (Note that both STAT 394/MATH 394 and STAT 395/MATH 395 are required to replace STAT 340 as a prerequisite for STAT 341.) STAT 341, STAT 342, STAT 421, STAT 423. (STAT 342 is required for enrollment in STAT 421 or STAT 423 by a statistics major; STAT 390 is not sufficient for a statistics major.) Additional requirements specified below. Minimum 2.0 grade in all courses used to satisfy major requirements. Minimum 2.50 cumulative GPA for all courses used to satisfy major requirements. A "Majors Factsheet" is available from the Statistics department. Additional Completion Requirements Minimum 9 credits Electives: at least three upper-division courses for a minimum total of 9 credits. Refer to department website for list of approved courses. Elective choices require prior approval of the Statistics undergraduate adviser.
