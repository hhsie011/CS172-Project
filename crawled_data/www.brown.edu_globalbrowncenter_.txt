Located in Room 310 in Page-Robinson Hall, the GBC coordinates International Orientation, advises international student organizations, assists with advocacy initiatives on campus, and plays a key role in Global Brown, a consortium of all of the offices at Brown that support the mobility of international students, scholars, and visitors to the Brown campus and the global mobility of the Brown community to various corners of the world! The GBC also offers a comfortable space designated for international students and student organizations to gather called the Global Brown Lounge, known among our students as "The Globe."
