The second is to ensure competency in sports medicine research design, production, analysis, and critical review. The fellowship provides military physical therapists an opportunity to develop advanced competencies in triage and management of acute sports injuries while at the United States Military Academy, West Point, NY. Graduates will use these same competencies to return injured soldiers, sailors, and airmen to a high level of military technical and tactical readiness. The concepts for managing injured elite athletes and returning them to the playing field as quickly and safely as possible shares the same common goal of returning injured service members to their units in garrison or combat, thereby preparing fellows for: Sports Medicine on the Battlefield…operational readiness through injury prevention and early intervention” Our vision is to set the standard for post-professional sports medicine-physical therapy doctoral education through the scholarly pursuit of academic, research and clinical excellence. We will achieve our vision by developing clinical scientists who are prepared to conduct advanced scientific research, as well as provide quality primary care for musculoskeletal injuries in the clinic and on the field. Our graduates as clinical scientists will become the future leaders and mentors for the profession of Physical Therapy.
