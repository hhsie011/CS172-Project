Disability and Accessibility As described in our Statement on Diversity and Community, Princeton University is a community devoted to learning. We actively seek students, faculty, and staff of exceptional ability and promise who share in our commitment to excellence in teaching and scholarship, and who will bring a diversity of viewpoints and cultures. By incorporating a broad range of human experiences and a rich variety of human perspectives, we enlarge our capacity for learning, enrich the quality and texture of campus life, and better prepare for life and leadership in a pluralistic society. Although we acknowledge the difficulties inherent in creating a community of individuals who are different from each other, we remain unwavering in our commitment to both diversity and community in a context of academic excellence. The following policies reflect our commitment to providing inclusive access to students, faculty, staff, alumni, and visitors of the University, as applicable: Overall Policy on Disability and Accessibility Princeton Policy on Digital Accessibility Service and Assistance Animals Policy Footer Accessibility Â© 2022 The Trustees of Princeton University
