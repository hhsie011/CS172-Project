skip to content Menu x Undergraduate Program Philosophy Undergraduate Advising is: the place to go to explore Philosophy as a new major or minor for degree-planning for existing majors to discuss post-graduation plans as well as to find out about Philosophy courses and faculty. Academic advising can also address more specific questions, such as selecting courses, problems with a class or professor, and referral to other UT services and resources. Academic Advisor Michelle D. Escalante WAG 313 512-475-9185 michelle.escalante@austin.utexas.edu Declaring the Major Philosophy is an open major. Students under 60 hours simply need to schedule an appointment with the Academic Advisor to declare. During peak times, such as registration and the first twelve class days, the Advisor may not be able to see students for new major declarations. Students over 60 hours can generally declare the Philosophy major by meeting with the Advisor, filling out an appeal form, and making a reasonable plan toward graduation. The Bouwsma Undergraduate Advising Center The Bouwsma Advising Center is in WAG 313. Students can go there for advising, to meet and study with friends, or to find information about UT resources and review examples of senior honors theses.
