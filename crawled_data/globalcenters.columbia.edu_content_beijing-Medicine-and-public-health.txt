In the most heart-stirring and powerful webinars of 2020, the Beijing Centre helped present “Nurses on the COVID-19 Frontlines” which brought together 400 nurses from all over the world. Although continents apart, the nursing professionals shared experiences that showcased their common courage and resilience in dealing with gravely ill patients, and their own physical and emotional burnout. The Beijing Center invited frontline nursing faculty, students, and clinicians from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, and Columbia University School of Nursing and New York-Presbyterian Hospital in New York, to share lessons learned that are essential for an effective pandemic response. The Beijing Center partnered with the Columbia School of Nursing to present the webinar. In Spring 2021, the Beijing Center featured a presentation by Jennifer Dohrn, Associate Professor and Assistant Dean of the Office of Global Initiatives titled “ Advancing Nursing Practice to Achieve Global Health Equity: What We Learn from Pandemics.” Dohrn talked with nurses in China about global developments in the profession.
