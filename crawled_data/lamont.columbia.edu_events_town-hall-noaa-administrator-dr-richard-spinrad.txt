The details are as follows: NOAA Town Hall Friday, March 25, 2022 12:30 p.m. - 1:45 p.m. Monell Auditorium, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory 61 Route 9W, Palisades, NY, 10964 NOAA is one of the most important and visionary research sponsors for the Climate School and the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory; over the last five years, NOAA has awarded us 65 projects totaling $35M. As NOAA advances its new strategic plan - prioritizing the Blue Economy, local climate services, and equity and inclusion - this is an important opportunity for us to showcase our community’s research innovation and impact, influence the agency’s priorities, and forge increasingly meaningful long-term partnerships. The Town Hall will include lightning talks by Columbia researchers, a strategic plan presentation by Dr. Spinrad, and an opportunity for Questions & Answers. Remote attendance will not be possible at this time. We very much hope that you will join us for this Town Hall in-person in the Monell Auditorium on the Lamont campus; for our colleagues based on other campuses, we encourage you to take advantage of the Intercampus Shuttle.
