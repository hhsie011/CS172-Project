Bailey Thomas is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Philosophy while on research leave from the University of Louisville where they are an Assistant Professor of Philosophy. Much of their research focuses on bridging the gaps between epistemic, ethical, and political spheres through an argument for the integration of ethical and political frameworks into social epistemology. Some of their other long-term projects include examining the intellectual components of the Radical Black Tradition and Black American feminism. Their current manuscript, tentatively titled Insidious Ignorance: Race, Power, and Cultures of Ignorance, focuses on examining a phenomenon they have termed as "insidious ignorance." They are also conducting research for their second book project which will focus on the politics and ethics of Black American frameworks of care and caring.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Philosophy People Curriculum Overview Major and Minor Course Schedule Honors Past Honors Theses Foreign Study Logic Software Foreign Study News & Events News & Events Student Prizes Gramlich Prize Winners Story Prize Winners Philosophy Faculty Prize Winners Lecture Series Gramlich Sapentia Race, Gender & Justice Workshops Philosophy & The Struggle Against Racism Social Justice Research Grants My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
