As such, the Santiago Center places special focus on education considering the challenges that Chile faces on this topic. Since its foundation, the Santiago Center has developed and facilitated various academic and professional training programs for Columbia students in collaboration with local partners. To further work in the educational field, the Santiago Center has formed associations with several local partners so as to develop and facilitate a number of academic and professional training programs for Columbia University students. They are geared mostly to graduate and PhD students but some undergraduates have also undertaken fieldwork in Chile through Study Abroad programs. In past years, these activities have included academic exchanges between astrophysics students at Columbia University and Universidad Católica as well as of students from the Aging Center of the Mailman School of Public Health and Universidad Mayor, among others. In the latter, and within the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, programs have been developed online. Also, the Center has continued to support the literary translation workshop Word for Word, which brings together graduate students at Columbia University’s School of the Arts and at Universidad Diego Portales (UDP) in Chile, for their works to be mutually translated. Within the current context this is also being developed online.
