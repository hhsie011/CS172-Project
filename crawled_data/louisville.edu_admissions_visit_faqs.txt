There are a few reasons that a date might not be available. The visit for that date might have reached capacity, the university might be closed, or it might be our annual fall or spring break. Please keep in mind that some dates do fill quickly and you should register as early as possible. We release visit dates one month at a time. What should I bring with me to a campus visit? You should bring something to write with and a list of questions you want to have answered. Remember to bring a refillable water container if needed – it is a 90-minute tour! What happens if there is severe weather on the day of my visit? All of our staff are trained how to respond in emergency weather situations. Please note the inclement weather policy for campus closings and delays. If classes are delayed two hours, the program will begin at the regularly scheduled time. If classes are canceled and the University is closed, the program will be canceled as well. You can follow our campus weather status on our homepage or call 502.852.5555 for the open status of our University. In the event of a closing, if you have already travelled to Louisville, please contact us and we will be willing to work with you! What should I wear? Dress casually for your visit to campus. Comfortable shoes for the tour are a must, and a jacket or umbrella are helpful in case of rain. Check the weather for Louisville. Where do I park? You will park at our North Information Center. Get directions. If you have a GPS and need the address for the North Info Center: 1999 South First Street, Louisville, KY. If parking at the North Center reaches capacity we will direct you to our Floyd Street Garage. How long is the campus visit? The campus visit is approximately two hours. The admissions information session is 45 minutes and the tour of campus takes about 90 minutes. What will I see on the tour? The campus tour will go through our Student Activities Center (SAC), Library, a residence hall, dining facilities, our new Student Recreation Center and much more! Can my parents come with me? Absolutely! Parents or guardians are always welcome on campus. When you register for your visit please indicate how many guests will accompany you to campus. I play a sport at my high school, can I meet with a coach? The Office of Admissions is not able to schedule athletic appointments. Please check out our athletics website for more information. Can I meet with a faculty member while I am there? When you register for your visit you can indicate an interest to speak with a departmental representative. Be sure to plan ahead- we need at least two weeks notice to request these appointments. We do our best to get you scheduled with a department but cannot guarantee it. Can I stay on campus for lunch after my tour? Absolutely! While on tour you will get to see many of our dining facilities. Stop by after your tour for lunch. I want to bring a group to campus, how can I sign up for a tour? If you want to bring a group to campus please complete our online request form.
