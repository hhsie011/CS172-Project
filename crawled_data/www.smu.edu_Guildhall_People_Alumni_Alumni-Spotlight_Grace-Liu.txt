I get to work with a highly-talented and like-minded team on a game I can't stop playing. What is the most interesting or enjoyable thing that you have gotten to do in your career? I got to do live drawing demos at Gamescom 2012 in Germany on Blizzard stage, a completely surreal experience. How did The Guildhall prepare you for your career in gaming? I learned 3D at Guildhall. Apart from that, the most helpful thing was getting used to working in a team under high pressure and tight time restraints. The resume/interview classes were also tremendously practical. What impact has the Guildhall had on your life? It got me prepared enough to get into the game industry, and I found my first game-related job in a Guildhall career fair. Guildhall has been a crucial step for me in getting to where I am today. What advice would you offer for aspiring game developers? Come as prepared as you can be. Passion and self-motivation are musts. Begin browsing sites like Gamasutra to get more insights into what game development might be like, and analyze the games you play. Work as hard as you can, stay open-minded, and focus on self-improvement and portfolio-building. There is no reason to not give it 200%. Research a bit on new games but do not play too much until you get that job you want. Look at professional games to understand your competition. A good number of professionals may respond if you email them with a few specific questions about the career path.
