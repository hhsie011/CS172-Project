Carey, Executive Vice President for Planning and Policy Tags Undergraduates Grad and Medical Students Faculty and Staff To the Brown Community: COVID-19 Testing Update: 04/29/21 - 05/05/21 Updates Dear Brown Community Members, Below, please find our weekly update on Brown’s testing program for COVID-19, with additional information and context to complement the data shared via our public dashboard: https://healthy.brown.edu/testing-tracing/dashboard As a reminder, all individuals 16 years of age and older who live, work or study in Rhode Island are eligible to get the COVID-19 vaccine at no cost and with no requirement for insurance. Vaccination appointments are readily available at the Dunkin Donuts Center in downtown Providence, and while appointments are no longer required at that site, you can schedule at https://www.vaccinateri.org. You no longer need an appointment to get vaccinated at CVS, Walgreens, Walmart and Stop & Shop pharmacy locations, and more information about those options can be found on the Rhode Island Department of Health website at: https://covid.ri.gov/vaccination#pharmacy. At Brown, since launching our routine testing program for the fall term on Aug. 24, we have conducted 386,231 asymptomatic tests to date. A total of 10,891 individuals have been tested in that timeframe, and the total number of positive test results is 566 (up 6 this week from a total of 560 last week) -- a prevalence rate of 5.2%. Here are highlights of the testing program over the last seven days, Thursday, April 29, through Wednesday, May 5: -- There have been 6 positive asymptomatic test results: 4 from employees, and 2 from off-campus students. As a reminder, our student testing program includes undergraduate, graduate and medical students. -- Over the past week, the employee asymptomatic positivity rate was 0.14%, and the student asymptomatic positivity rate was 0.04%. The Rhode Island positivity rate during this same time period was 1.87%. -- The average turnaround time for asymptomatic test results during this period was approximately 19 hours. -- University Health Services (UHS) conducted 10 symptomatic tests of students. Of these, none were positive for COVID-19. Exact results for symptomatic students who are tested by UHS are not reported (and do not appear on the public dashboard) to protect the confidentiality of the small numbers of students who are tested. We will report on ranges and any concerns regarding trends in these weekly summaries. -- The University does not directly test symptomatic employees, as they receive health care from their individual providers. We do monitor employee absences due to COVID-19 -- which can be for a range of reasons, including care of a child or family member or quarantine due to a known exposure -- and the number of such absences for the most recent full work week was 9. -- It is important to note that with regard to all positive cases, we have taken action consistent with our contact tracing protocols, COVID-19 Campus Safety Policy, isolation and quarantine procedures, and other measures outlined in Brown’s Plan for a Healthy and Safe 2020-21. As a reminder, if you are currently being tested once a week and would like to change to twice a week, you are welcome to do so. Students can email studenttesting@brown.edu to make that change. Faculty and staff can email employeetestinguhr@brown.edu for guidance on how to increase their testing frequency. Please feel free to contact us with any questions or concerns. For questions or support regarding the testing program, students can contact the student testing support team (401-863-6500, studenttesting@brown.edu), and faculty and staff can contact the employee testing support team (401-368-4828, employeetestinguhr@brown.edu).
