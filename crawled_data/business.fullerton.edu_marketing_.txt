Marketing is creative. Marketing is consumer psychology. Marketing is analytical. Marketing is strategic. Marketers lead businesses in creatively satisfying market needs in a sustainable and ethical manner. They achieve this by understanding customer needs, and then creating, communicating, pricing, and delivering products and services that are of value to customers and society. Our department prepares students to be marketing leaders by developing a fundamental understanding of marketing functions and mastering the necessary skill sets. We bring state-of-the-art concepts and practices to the classroom, including use of cutting-edge technology for design, research, analysis, and customer service. Students can focus on areas such as digital marketing, social media marketing, advertising and promotions, marketing analytics, brand management, sales, and marketing strategy. We help students find entry level marketing positions through our own career fairs, networking events, client projects, internships, and connections with alumnae. Additionally, all marketing students develop a professional portfolio that they can take to interviews. In the past, our students have found jobs in companies such as Google, Amazon, MTV, Verizon, and Enterprise. They have also been placed in local businesses and many have been successful entrepreneurs! Our faculty have relevant work experience, as well as doctoral degrees from the most reputable business schools in North America; including Penn State, Indiana University, USC, Arizona State, Concordia University, Canada, University of Houston, UC Irvine, and Temple University. We are dedicated to making class interactive, practical, interesting, and fun. Why Marketing? Read More » Internships and Jobs Looking for a job?
