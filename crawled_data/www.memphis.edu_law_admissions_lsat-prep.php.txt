Since all LSAT scores are included on the Credential Assembly Service (CAS) report, applicants are encouraged to prepare and not to take the exam cold. More information on preparing for the LSAT can be found online through LSAC. LSAC publications, including those listed below, can be ordered online or at 215-968-1001. Many test prep companies also offer classes and materials for test preparation. Sample LSAT items available through LSAC include: Khan Academy The Official LSAT SuperPrep - $16.24 The Official 10 Actual LSAT PrepTests - $19.95 LSAT Official Individual PrepTests - $ 10.00 Kindle or Nook Ebooks - $ 5.99 Admission Criteria Our admissions process seeks those applicants with the greatest chance for success, both in their education and in their future careers. As a result, admission into the University of Memphis Cecil C. Humphrey's School of Law is competitive. Each year we receive and process approximately 1,000 applications. These applicants are competing for 150 seats in the entering class. A significant factor in the admission process is the "admission index," which is based on the applicant's undergraduate grade point average and the applicant's highest Law School Admission Test (LSAT) score. The undergraduate grade point average used in the admissions index is the cumulative grade point average found on the CAS report as calculated by the Law School Admission Council. While the admission index uses the highest LSAT score, if an applicant has taken the LSAT more than once he or she is encouraged to explain, in a statement, any variance in their LSAT scores. Also considered are factors deemed to be predictive of success in law school as set forth in the application may include, but are not limited to, overall academic record, extracurricular activities, community involvement, employment, and other life experiences. Applicants are encouraged to submit letters of recommendation addressing their potential for academic success. As a publicly assisted institution of the state, Tennessee residents may be given preference in selection; however, non-resident applicants are encouraged to apply and must submit a separate statement detailing reasons for wanting to attend the University of Memphis School of Law. Memphis Law recognizes the benefits of diversity in the classroom. We endeavor to create a student body representative of a wide range of social, economic, racial and ethnic backgrounds and experiences. In the personal statement, applicants are encouraged to identify ways in which they may contribute to the diversity of Memphis Law.
