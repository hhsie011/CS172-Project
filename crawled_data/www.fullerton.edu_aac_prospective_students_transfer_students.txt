Incoming fall transfer student advising workshops At the Academic Advising Center, we are dedicated to your success and would like to offer our support in preparation for your first semester at CSUF! The Center hosts advising workshops for new transfer students beginning in July. These workshops are designed to help students, with Incomplete Final Evaluation Status on the Titan Degree Audit (TDA), be able to select courses and create an efficient path to graduation. Important Note: The workshops hosted by the Academic Advising Center are not the same as the registration and advising and orientation required by the University.
