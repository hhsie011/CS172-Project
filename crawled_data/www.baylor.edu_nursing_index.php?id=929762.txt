Research The overarching theme of Dr. Spies's research is building capacity in health care providers to address priority population health issues. In response to COVID she is collaborating to globally explore the experiences of Nurse Practitioners as front-line care providers during the pandemic. Dr. Spies's primary ongoing research focus is nurse-led behavior change interventions to improve hypertension outcomes in the African context. Her recently completed funded study evaluated bundled hypertension interventions of nurse-led education, support, and technology in Uganda. Dr. Spies was awarded a 2017-2019 Fulbright Global US Scholar Award. The Fulbright study, A Multinational Collaborative Initiative to Develop Country Specific Nurse Implemented Hypertension Interventions, was implemented in India, Vietnam, and Zambia.
