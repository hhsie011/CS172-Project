The Provost (or their designee) shall have the sole discretion as to whether or not a particular policy is included in the Portal. Individuals are responsible for familiarizing themselves with all applicable policies, whether or not they are included in the Portal. For questions regarding the inclusion of a particular policy in the Portal, please contact policies@dartmouth.edu.
