Students admitted under the program fulfill their senior year of undergraduate credits and earn their bachelor’s degrees after successfully completing the first year of JD coursework. To be eligible for admission under this program, students must complete three full years of undergraduate coursework in a qualifying major at the University of Louisville or one of the law school’s 3+3 partner institutions: Campbellsville University, Kentucky Wesleyan College, Murray State University and Union College. Typically, 3+3 students must satisfy all general education requirements and major-specific course work for the bachelor’s degree prior to matriculating at Louisville Law, unless they have received approval from their undergraduate program that first-year JD courses will satisfy outstanding major-specific requirements. Questions about how to structure your undergraduate studies so that you are eligible for the 3+3 Accelerated Law Program should be directed to your undergraduate program advisor. Interested students must apply by the regular application deadline of April 15 to be considered for admission under the 3+3 program. 3+3 applicants are subject to the same entrance standards as traditional first-year applicants and may receive a conditional offer of admission, contingent on continued academic performance. As part of the application process, 3+3 applicants must interview with the law school’s Office of Admissions. 3+3 students pay the law school tuition rate for all three years of their enrollment at Louisville Law. For 3+3 students earning their bachelor’s degree from the University of Louisville, undergraduate scholarships may be applied toward the first year of the JD program.
