The goal of TASHE is to increase knowledge of the signs and symptoms of stroke among those identified to be at high-risk for stroke in New York City. Stroke education that improves recognition and urgent action in the event of stroke can save many lives and greatly improve stroke outcomes. As a result, patients are more likely to arrive at the hospital more quickly, due to early stroke recognition and 911-activation, and they may be eligible for highly effective and life-saving treatment.
