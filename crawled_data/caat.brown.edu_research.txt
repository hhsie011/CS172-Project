Sub Navigation In This Section Brain Breast Cardiac Fish Liver Lung Ovary Prostate Tissue Model of Fibrosis Two-Compartment Liver Research Center research teams are using microtissues to assess the effects of chemical exposures on brain, breast, heart, lung, ovary, and prostate cells. Through an integration of biology and engineering, we have devised simple, high-throughput 3D microtissues as predictive biology platforms that reflect human physiology and disease, solving fundamental questions of adverse biological response. 75,000 Chemicals in use in the United States--most have not been tested for their safety 23% Global burden of cardiovascular disease attributable to environmental chemicals Brain Researchers led by Diane Hoffman-Kim are using brain microtissues to investigate the development of the nervous system, the toxicity of environmental chemicals as well as diseases and disorders of the brain, including stroke and traumatic brain injury.
