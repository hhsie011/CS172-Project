Application Fee Required of applicants to all programs $100 non-refundable application fee payable at time of online application submission by credit card only. We do not accept checks or bank money orders. We will not accept cash or postal money orders. No exceptions. Applications are not considered complete unless accompanied by the fee. The school does not grant application fee waivers. Academic Transcripts Required of applicants to all programs A bachelor’s degree from a regionally accredited U.S. university or its equivalent from another country, awarded by the summer of the year that you begin classes, is required. During the initial phase of the application process, you are permitted to upload unofficial copies of your academic transcripts for evaluation purposes via the application portal. You must submit transcripts from every university you have attended, without exception. Should you be accepted and choose to enroll, you will then need to submit official academic transcripts from every university you have attended to the school. Please review the official transcript submission methods below: Transcripts from Domestic Institutions Electronic transcripts: Receiving electronic transcripts via a point-to-point system that bypasses the student (using vendors such as Parchment, Credentials Solutions, and the National Student Clearinghouse) enhances efficiency and ensures authenticity of materials. All admitted students who have attended a college or university in the United States must submit electronic transcripts directly from their school, delivered directly to The Office of Admission. Paper transcripts: If an admitted student’s U.S.-based institution does not offer electronic delivery, the student must write to the Office of Admission with the link to their prior U.S. institution’s webpage concerning transcript orders to confirm that paper is the only option and obtain permission to submit a paper transcript. If a paper transcript is the only option, it must be sent directly from the other institution to Columbia, and not delivered or forwarded via the student. Transcripts from International Institutions International institutions outside of the People’s Republic of China: Admitted students who attended international institutions must submit an electronic transcript if their school offers secure online delivery. If the school cannot send transcripts electronically through a secure online system, they must contact World Education Services (WES) and order a course-by-course evaluation and International Credential Advantage Package to be sent directly to The Office of Admission (Columbia Journalism School, 203 Pulitzer Hall, Mail Code 3801, 2950 Broadway, New York, NY 10027). International institutions in the People’s Republic of China: Admitted students who attended institutions in the People’s Republic of China can access a unique resource through CHESICC, the credentials verification service affiliated with the People’s Republic of China’s Ministry of Education, to arrange for submission of a “Verification Report of China Higher Education Student’s Academic Transcripts” AND a “Verification Report of China Higher Education Qualification Certificate.” These should be delivered electronically to the appropriate admissions office at Columbia. Writing Test Required of applicants to M.S. and M.S./Computer Science programs and by M.A. applicants who indicate they would also like to be considered for the M.S. program. The writing test is taken from mid-November through mid-January. The test format is short answer and open-ended questions. Test information will be sent after the application has been submitted. The Office of Admission will email you regarding test logistics in early November. The writing test takes approximately two hours and focuses on an applicant’s reporting, writing, and critical thinking skills. This is not a test of current affairs, and there is no way to study for the exam. This test is administered by a service called ProctorU. All students will take the test remotely, regardless of location. You do not need to travel to New York City to take the test. We do not have a sample test online. Proof of English Language Proficiency Required of applicants to all programs Current official TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) or IELTS (International English Language Testing System) score reports are required for: M.S. and M.A. applicants: if you indicate that you did not complete your entire undergraduate education at an English-language university.￼￼￼ Ph.D. applicants: if either English is not your native language OR you indicate that you did not complete your entire undergraduate education at an English-language university. TOEFL scores are valid for two years from the test date. Waivers of this requirement are rarely given and must be requested and approved before the application deadline. The Graduate School of Journalism reference code for ETS is 2120. On the TOEFL, we require a minimum score of 650 (paper-based) or 114 (internet-based); and for the IELTS we require a minimum score of 8.0.

PROFESSIONAL INTERESTS/M.S. ESSAY (750 word limit) Required of applicants to M.S. programs What led you to your interest in journalism? What experience, if any, do you have in journalism? What do you hope to gain through your work at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism?

Describe an example of what you would consider a high quality data journalism piece and explain what makes it a good story. We also want to know about any previous experience with computation and projects that drew from data or made some use of data analysis and/or reporting data. You will not be required to demonstrate a strong data portfolio, however, but instead demonstrate a strong interest in the subject. Stabile Investigative Journalism Specialization Essay (for Stabile applicants only) Before applying to the Toni Stabile Center investigative journalism specialization, we urge you to think carefully about your skills, educational goals, and professional ambitions. Note that investigative journalism is about exposing wrongdoing in the public interest; it is about holding powerful individuals and institutions accountable. Investigative techniques are useful for a range of stories, but investigative reporting is not just about the use of these techniques, it is also about the exposure of wrongdoing. Please describe how your educational or professional experience has prepared you to undertake the investigative journalism specialization. The bulk of this essay should make a case for your admission to the investigative journalism specialization. It will be helpful to the admission committee if you discuss some ideas for your master’s project or thesis since this will be the most significant investigative piece you will complete at the School. Documentary Essay (for Documentary applicants only) The Documentary Program is a selective concentration for those who feel passionately about learning in-depth visual storytelling. The bulk of this essay should make the case for your admission to the documentary specialization. Please describe why you want to make documentaries and what subject area(s) might interest you and why. In your answer, cite some documentaries you have seen that you think fulfill a journalistic potential. PROFESSIONAL INTERESTS/M.A. ESSAY (750 word limit) Required of applicants to M.A. program Submit a stringent self-assessment of your work as a journalist or in Columbia’s Master of Science program, pointing out strengths and weaknesses. If you have not been enrolled as a student in the past five years, we would like to know what opportunities and challenges you foresee in pursuing the Master of Arts, as well as how you expect to change your career path after completing this program. If you have recently completed our Master of Science program, we would appreciate your specific ideas regarding the added value the Master of Arts program will confer upon you, and your assessment of the relationship between the two curricula. PROGRAM INTERESTS ESSAYS (750 word limit) Required of applicants to M.A. program This essay should make the case for your admission to your chosen major within the M.A. program.
