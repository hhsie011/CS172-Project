For all letters and packages use the mailing address generated in the Student Address Sample Label box. Mail Information Mail is delivered directly to each residence hall or complex and posted in their mailboxes. The box number corresponds with the room or apartment number in each hall or complex. It is recommended that checks, plane tickets, and other valuables be sent by registered mail as a precautionary measure. Mail may not be delivered to residence halls during holiday breaks such as semester break and spring break. Hall offices will not mail out packages. No USPS packages are delivered on Saturday. Students who need to mail items on campus can take advantage of CopyMail, which serves as a mail center for the Texas Tech community. Some student packages requiring a signature and pick up by students are also kept there. Students can visit CopyMail at the Student Union Building, room 100, near the Food Court. CopyMail's hours of operation are 8:30 a.m. – 4:00 p.m. Monday through Friday and is closed 12:00 p.m. – 1:00 p.m. during the summer. University Student Housing uses EZTrackIt to track and notify students about packages from delivery services. Students who have recently moved off-campus should update their Mail Forwarding Address to make sure they receive all their mail. General Mailing Information Packages University Student Housing uses EZTrackIt to track and notify students about packages from delivery services. As packages arrive hall staff will tag each package using the carrier bar-coded sticker so staff know which packages have been logged in and which have not. This bar code will help the hall office track important information on each package including the student name, package type, carrier type, and the day it arrived. After a package is recorded and inventoried, EZTrackIt will send an email notification to each recipient. This way students can find out about their packages faster and pick them up more quickly. Additionally, each student has a customized website where they can view the packages they have awaiting pickup. This is another reason to check your Texas Tech email! Finally, when a student comes to pick up a package, the student will have to show and swipe their student ID to confirm that they are are picking up the right package. Staff will then scan the package and indicate it has been picked up, so students know which packages have been received and which packages have not. Below is a list of addresses per hall for shipping packages. When receiving a package or mail that will not fit in the mailbox, residents will receive an e-mail by our package program EZTrackIT notifying them they have a package. Residents must present proof of identity to retrieve packages from the hall office. As a precautionary measure, it is recommended that checks, plane tickets and other valuables be sent by registered or insured mail. Mail sent with endorsements (insurance, delivery confirmations, etc.) will be sent to Mail Tech where students may pick up their items. Packages will be accepted by the halls beginning August 1st. It is the responsibility of the student to provide a mail forwarding address at the end of the contract term so that University Student Housing staff may forward packages and first-class stamped mail.
