You can earn money to help cover your non-tuition financial expenses, such as textbooks, school supplies or essential personal items, by working for Temple or an approved off-campus employer. To be eligible, students must have a valid Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) on file and qualify for federal financial aid. Students must also demonstrate a need that’s unmet by their financial aid offer. All needs are determined by a student’s FAFSA. Work-study is packaged on a student’s financial aid offer. Students who do not have work-study on their current aid offer can request a review for the grant by contacting us. Contact For more information about work-study, email wkstudy@temple.edu. Work-study Opportunities Work-study opportunities are job opportunities within your college, on campus, at a university office or at an authorized off-campus employer that has a current contract with Temple.
