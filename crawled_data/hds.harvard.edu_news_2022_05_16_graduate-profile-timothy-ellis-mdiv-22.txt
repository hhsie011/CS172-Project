Memorable Moment I worked at Harvard Divinity School Library my first year before the pandemic. Having late night conversations with other student workers, attempting to explain our denominations or theologies to each other. Trying to articulate what call or purpose looked like. It felt like the conversations I'd come to seminary to have with other people. Favorite Class or Professor Our "Unitarian Universalist History" class took at trip to Baltimore for the UU Studies Convocation. We met other UU seminaries from across the country and heard talks from UU historians and scholars. It was a great experience to build connections with my newfound peers and colleagues. Future Plans I'll be moving to Idaho in August to serve the Boise and Magic Valley Unitarian Universalist Fellowships as their intern minister.
