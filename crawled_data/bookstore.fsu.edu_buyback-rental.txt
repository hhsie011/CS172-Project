Books must be in re-salable condition. Missing pages, water damage, excessive highlighting, answers written in, broken bindings, etc. are not acceptable buyback conditions. If an instructor has requested your textbook for the next term, then the value increases. Books falling into this category may be worth between 30% to 50% of the original purchase price. Generally speaking, textbooks will be purchased until we reach the limit of our shelf stock requirements, so the sooner you get your books to us, the greater the chance it will be eligible for buyback.
