Tours & Research Visits ISU students, staff and faculty, alumni and other adult groups Tours of the ISU Library typically consist of a fifteen- to thirty-minute general orientation to the Library, its collections, services, and selected service areas, and selected artwork, and typically are led by Library staff from the Reference and Instruction Department. Tours do not normally include database demonstrations, orientation to online resources, or instruction. To request an ISU Library tour, please contact Emily Simmons, emsimmon@iastate.edu at 515-294-6117. University Museums staff may provide tours of artwork in the Library. In-class instruction sessions To arrange for a librarian to teach an in-class instruction session for ISU students and classes, please consult the Directory of liaison librarians. Visiting high school classes Visiting high school classes planning a research day in the ISU Library will want to review the Research Visits guidelines and make arrangements well in advance. The Library does not offer tours for elementary school children. Requesting tours Requests for tours should be made at least two weeks in advance of the desired date, in order to allow us to make necessary arrangements. Every effort will be made to accommodate tour groups, but the ISU Library reserves the right to decline a tour if there are scheduling conflicts, or insufficient notification time for necessary arrangements. For more information, please contact Emily Simmons, emsimmon@iastate.edu at 515-294-6117.
