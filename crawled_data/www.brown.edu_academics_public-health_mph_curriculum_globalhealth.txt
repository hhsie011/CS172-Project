Global health research and training focus on health inequalities within communities and populations and across populations throughout the world. Global health thus focuses on domestic and international health inequalities, and is not about crossing borders but bridging health inequalities with scientific evidence of etiology and prevention. Global Health Concentration Specific Competencies Evaluate the population health measures of a specific global health a) infectious disease, or closely related disease, and b) a non-communicable disease (NCD) in a specific low and middle-income country (LMIC), or region, or in a resource poor defined population. Apply a health equity framework to a specific global public health issue. Evaluate best practices for establishing global research collaborations. Analyze strategies for implementing rigorous ethical approaches to research with vulnerable populations and conduct of global research. Ensure intervention designs are both culturally appropriate, reflecting the needs within resource-constrained settings, and have sufficient rigor to provide quality evidence. Apply an implementation science theory, model, or framework to the development of a research study to test an implementation strategy in a global setting. Develop an inventory of multi-disciplinary programs, initiatives, organizations, and policies that contain key interventions to address global health inequalities. Design, write, and present a health brief reporting research findings from global health research. Students who matriculated prior to Fall 2020 should click here.
