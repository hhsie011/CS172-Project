As the fall semester begins, we‚Äôd like to update you with a few notes about CCIT services. Classroom Tech CCIT upgraded a host of classrooms last year for remote teaching and learning. Currently, CCIT provides full audio-visual training and support for over 250 central classrooms throughout campus. Central classrooms have a standard set of equipment including a projector with HDMI, microphones and wireless capabilities. All classrooms are equipped with a camera and microphone that integrates with Zoom or Webex, along with a number of more advanced rooms equipped specifically for distance education courses or for courses with a lecture capture requirement. More information is available in our Classroom Technology guides. If you have not used the new technology or need a refresher, check out our Classroom Technology checklist. Don‚Äôt miss a ‚ÄúMeet Your Classroom Tech‚Äù session in August! Get familiar with your classroom‚Äôs tech in person, scheduled from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. on August 16 and 17 in Brackett Hall. Learn more at Clemson News. Employee Printing Network printers can be accessed by using PaperCut, which allows faculty, staff, and students to access campus printers. When you get a new computer that has been set up by our department, PaperCut is already installed and ready for your use. To learn more about PaperCut, visit our Faculty and Staff Printing page. TigerOne Mobile ID You can now add your TigerOne Mobile ID to your Android device. Open doors, buy food, check out books and a lot more right from your phone. Learn more on the TigerOne website. Training CCIT offers a library of live and on-demand online training through the Skillsoft Percipio platform. This service provides in-depth courseware, books and materials on a wide variety of topics, ranging from technology to marketing, all available at clemson.percipio.com. Research Computing Clemson has a world-class high performance and data-intensive computing environment known as Palmetto for faculty and students to use in their research and education pursuits. Assistance through CCIT‚Äôs CITI organization can help you best take advantage of these resources through one-on-one consultations and training. For more information on Palmetto and CITI, visit citi.clemson.edu. How can we help? Text, chat tech support available Every page at ccit.clemson.edu has an orange chat box that can connect you instantly with a CCIT Support Center representative during operating hours. In addition to calling the CCIT Support Center at (864) 656-3494, you can send a text to that same number and receive immediate assistance. Of course, you can always send an email to us at ITHELP@clemson.edu or visit us on the second floor of Cooper Library (COVID clearance required). For local support, please check out the listings at ccit.clemson.edu/support/faculty-staff/tech-support-program for the appropriate personnel that supports your college or department.

Google Workspace passwords can be reset by visiting clemson.edu/emailforwarding and clicking the link near the bottom of the page. Does your course require specific software packages? Many times, we can help get software to your students without a trip to the CCIT Support Center. Most Windows software can be installed through CCIT Software Center and most Mac software can be installed through our Mac software installer, both are available for download at download.clemson.edu. Information on specialty software can found on our Software Licenses page. Students can also access our new CUApps powered by Citrix to use a wide range of software in the cloud without having to install it to their computers. More information is available at clemson.edu/cuapps. Please email us at ITHELP@clemson.edu if there‚Äôs a specific software package needed for your course.
