Baylor University's Guaranteed Tuition Option offers students the opportunity to lock in a four-year tuition rate instead of paying the regular tuition rate, which is subject to increase annually. Participation in the Guaranteed Tuition Option eliminates uncertainty about the cost of tuition, and it allows students and families to prepare their educational budgets more accurately. 2022-23 Tuition Rates Undergraduate students enrolling full-time (12 hours or more) in the Fall of 2022 will be charged one of the following tuition rates: Semester Rate Annual Rate Regular Tuition Rate $25,869 $51,738 Guaranteed Tuition Option $27,231 $54,462 Students will be charged the regular tuition rate if no election is made. Undergraduate students who lock in the guaranteed rate but enroll in fewer than 12 hours in a fall/spring semester will pay an hourly rate of $2,269 per hour. Students who complete their undergraduate degree and continue their graduate studies at Baylor will also pay the hourly rate of $2,269 per hour during fall or spring semesters as long as it is still within the 48-month program period. The guaranteed hourly rate for summer terms is $1,517 per hour (first effective summer 2022). Students in need of more than four years (48 months) to complete their Baylor education will be charged tuition at the University's regular rate in the fifth year and in any subsequent years. Graduation Success Resources This video series, hosted by Dr. Blaine McCormick, Associate Professor - Management & Entrepreneurship in the Hankamer School of Business, is designed to provide food for thought when planning for your college experience. Additional financial and graduation success resources are available on our Financial Literacy webpage. Election to Participate Election of the 2022-23 Guaranteed Tuition Option will begin June 1, 2022 and the deadline to elect is July 31, 2022 (Fall Financial Settlement deadline). During the enrollment period, students may enroll by logging into BearWeb > Student Financial Services > Student Account > Guaranteed Tuition Option. By electing to participate in the Guaranteed Tuition Option, students choose to pay a tuition rate which is initially higher than the regular rate. However, the guaranteed tuition rate is fixed and will not increase over the 48-month enrollment period. No promise is made regarding any future tuition increases. A student who graduates and continues his/her graduate studies at Baylor during the 48-month enrollment period will continue to be charged tuition at the guaranteed hourly rate during the period. Cancellation Enrollment in the Guaranteed Tuition Option may be canceled at any time by contacting Student Accounts. Notice received within the first two weeks of a semester will terminate the election effective that semester. When notice is received after the first two weeks of a semester, termination will become effective (and the student will be charged the regular tuition rate) beginning the following semester.
