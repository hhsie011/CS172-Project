Brown has been a leader in entrepreneurial education, and several startup companies have been formed by Brown alumni. Roots of Entrepreneurial Education Professor Barrett Hazeltine arrived at Brown University in 1959 and for more than 50 years has been the face of entrepreneurship on the Brown campus. Formally trained as an electrical engineer, Hazeltine has taught business management classes since the mid-1960s, and served as an advocate and mentor to hundreds of students. Through his famous “Engine 9” and “Engine 90” classes and independent study projects, Hazeltine has helped inspire countless entrepreneurs.
