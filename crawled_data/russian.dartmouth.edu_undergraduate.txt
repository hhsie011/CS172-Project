The Russian Studies programs at Dartmouth are designed to provide students with a solid working capability in the language as well as a familiarity with the literature and, more broadly, the culture of Russia. PreviousNext About the Program Every major, in consultation with an advisor, will choose a set of electives that will result in a concentration on one of these three areas: language, culture, or literature. Alternatively, those wishing to take courses related to Russian in such disciplines as History, Government, or Economics should consider the Russian Area Studies Major. Both majors require Russian 31, which can be omitted only by a vote of the entire Department. Read more about: The Standard Russian Major for those whose interest is primarily in literature and culture, or who simply wish to attain a mastery of the language. The Area Studies Major is intended for those who want to learn Russian and to do work in International Studies. The Minor in Russian is for those who wish to obtain a minor in Russian language and literature. The Minor in Russian Area Studies is for those who want to learn about Russian literature and civilization without advanced language study. A qualified student in any of these majors also has the option of participation in the Honors Program. Please watch our video about the Russian Department.(click here to watch the video) In our language program, you can start from scratch, with no prior knowledge of Russian. Or you can place into a higher level by taking our placement exam. Students who wish to take the test should contact our Language Program Director, Alfia Rakova, as the test is being administered in person due to the hand-writing requirement.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Russian Undergraduate Majors and Minors Majors: Russian Language and Area Studies Minors Courses Course Descriptions Courses by Term Placement Test Awards & Prizes The Solzhenitsyn Prize in Russian The Pray Modern Language Prize in Russian The Richard Sheldon Prize The Honors Program Foreign Study Resources & Opportunities Overview Student Assistant Teacher Opportunities Martin T.
