Brown University Library Digital Bookplates View all bookplates View sample catalog record In Honor of Graduating Student Assistants Brown University Library bookplates recognize the support of endowments and gifts in building collections and supporting all aspects of the Library's work and mission. Through endowments, donors honor the interests, achievements, and memories of their colleagues, mentors, and loved ones. For gifts that support collections, the Library's digital bookplating program places a permanent link to each bookplate in the online catalog record for titles acquired through the generosity of the Library's donors.
