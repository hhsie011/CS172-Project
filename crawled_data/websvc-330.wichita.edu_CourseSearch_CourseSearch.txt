This search is not connected to the registration system. The user should record the CRN of courses in which they are interested in so they can be entered in the registration system. Students can also use the Banner search inside the secure myWSU portal. Your search can be narrowed by selecting filters within the search block to the left. Most searches require at least one subject to be selected. Searches that can be performed without a Subject filter are General Education, Course Number, Course Attributes, and Class Start Time. Some filters use "or" logic while others use "and". Selecting multiple days of the week will show you any course that has that day of the week, e.g., selecting Monday will return classes meeting Monday, Mon/Wed, Mon/Wed/Fri, etc. Selecting multiple attributes will only return classes that have ALL of those attributes.
