The project includes five murals within walking distance of each other in the city’s Arts District. The mural by Norman, Modesitt and their students is a life-size architectural drawing of a mid-19th century shotgun house called “Open House.” The project’s goal is to bring vibrancy to New Orleans outside of gallery walls and was funded by a $175,000 grant from the Helis Foundation.https://tulane.it/shotgun-house-mural art Impression: Collin Ferguson Collin Ferguson (B ’04) considers the arts community to be the greatest natural resource that New Orleans possesses. art Empire Exhibit If one could enter a door that leads inside a mind full of historic memories, that experience might feel the same as walking through the EMPIRE exhibit at the Newcomb Art Museum. art Feminists in the Visual Arts Lynda Benglis created The Wave of the World when she won a contest sponsored by the 1984 World’s Fair in New Orleans.
