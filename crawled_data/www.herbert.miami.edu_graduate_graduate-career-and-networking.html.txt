What To Expect Incoming Full-Time MBA Students: from the moment you accept an offer of admission to Miami Herbert Business School, the Graduate Career Advancement Team is ready to help begin accelerating your career. You will have the opportunity to start mapping your career plan and developing your personal brand even before setting foot on campus. Between faculty, the alumni network, mentors, classmates, industry partners, and career coaches, the Miami Herbert community will help you find your fit. Career Connect Typically, six weeks before classes begin, if not earlier, the Miami Herbert Career Advancement team launches the highly effective Career Connect course, where students polish resumes, improve elevator pitches, build personal brands, practice virtual interviewing, commence building a target company list, and much more. Before ever arriving on campus, students will know the name of their career coach, the person who will be their champion and advocate helping them advance their careers. Our approach to career advancement is comprehensive, systematic, and data driven. The Graduate Career Center is an amazing resource for students. The staff helped me with my resume and prepared me for the interview process at Boston Consulting Group. Weeks later, I received a full-time job offer.
