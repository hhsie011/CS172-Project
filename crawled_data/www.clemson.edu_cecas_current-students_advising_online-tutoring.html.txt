Let our peer leaders offer tips and tricks, review concepts and practice problems, and help you improve your study skills. We offer several formats for support sponsored by various providers. View Schedules Tutoring Sessions The College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences (CECAS) has chosen students that have performed well in the courses they tutor. In addition to class work concepts, they can provide techniques to study and retain course information. Undergraduate Teaching Assistants (UTA) General Engineering Undergraduate Teaching Assistants [UTAs] provide both in-class and out-of-classroom support to current General Engineering students. Because UTAs are in the classroom, they are better able to assist students regarding concepts and techniques taught in the courses. Support is available to any student enrolled in a general engineering course. Contact UTA PEER/WISE Programs for Educational Enrichment and Retention (PEER) and Women in Science in Engineering (WISE) offer small group tutoring in Math, Science, Computer Science, and upper-level Engineering courses by peers who have successfully completed the course and been recommended by a faculty member. Group size varies based on demand. Support is available to all students in the College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences. Contact PEER/WISE RISE Residents in Science & Engineering (RISE) offers small group peer tutoring in introductory science, math, and engineering courses for those enrolled in the RISE program.
