We are thrilled to provide summer learning opportunities to these talented students and grateful, in turn, that we are able to increase the reach of our scholarship dollars. Currently, our partnerships serve to enhance access to higher education for: students from historically underrepresented groups first-generation students low-income students Information for Partner Scholar Nominees Partner Scholarship eligibility is determined by partner organization nomination. You should only apply if directed to do so by a partner organization. Partner Scholar Application Fee Waivers To ensure that you are identified as a Partner Scholar nominee, simply request the partner fee waiver when submitting your application. Partner organizations provide Brown with a roster of Partner Scholar nominees, which allows us to verify your partner status. Students who are not affiliated with a current partner organization should not request this type of fee waiver. If you are unsure of your eligibility as a Partner Scholar, please contact your organization or precollegepartnerships@brown.edu. Eligibility In order to qualify for a Partner Scholarship, you must: be nominated by a current partner organization (you will see our list of current partners when you select the partner application fee waiver option in your Pre-College application) demonstrate financial need (as confirmed by the partner organization) be accepted into a Pre-College program complete any financial aid application process that may be required directly by your partner organization (Please note: not all partner organizations require a financial aid application) Award Amounts and Usage of a Partner Scholarship Partner Scholarships may only be applied toward one course. Partner Scholarship awards are applied to program fees and supplemental fees (if any). For on-campus residential programs, program fees include the course fee, meals and housing. For Location-Based programs, program fees include the course fee (which includes meals and housing). For online programs, program fees include the course fee only. Partner Scholarship awards do not cover course materials and textbooks (if any), Brown-sponsored limited accident and sickness, short-term insurance (which is required only if you do not provide proof that you have health insurance that is accepted in the U.S.), pre-arrival COVID-19 testing and vaccinations (if required), spending money (for shopping, off campus snacks, purchases of a personal nature, etc.), travel to and from campus or a Location-Based site and other related travel expenses; however, many partner organizations provide assistance or guidance to Partner Scholars in need of additional support. Partner Scholars are typically able to finance the full billable cost of their Brown Pre-College program through the Partner Scholarship. However, some Partner Scholars may need to pay a small portion of their costs, if required by the partner organization. How to Apply for a Partner Scholarship You must be nominated by your organization by March 7, 2022 to be considered for a Partner Scholarship. A nomination for the Partner Scholarship does not guarantee admission. Partner Scholar nominees are considered for acceptance to Pre-College programs based on the same criteria used for all applicants. Accepting a Partner Scholarship If admitted into a Brown Pre-College program, you should accept your offer of admission and register for your course through your student portal. Your enrollment deposit fee will be waived automatically.
