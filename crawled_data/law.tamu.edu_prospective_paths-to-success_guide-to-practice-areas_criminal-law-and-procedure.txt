Students/ Paths to Success/ Guide to Practice Areas/ Criminal Law and Procedure Criminal Law As a lawyer who practices criminal law, you will either prosecute criminal cases or defend those accused of crimes. Your choice to prosecute the accused or to defend them will determine where you work. Prosecutors work in local district attorney’s offices and for the federal Department of Justice. Defense lawyers can work for public defenders’ offices or work privately through a law firm. Many defense lawyers who work in law firms take court appointments. This means that they, like public defenders, handle cases for defendants who cannot afford to hire a lawyer. After you gain experience in criminal law, you may decide to change direction. Lawyers who have practiced criminal law for several years often switch sides — from prosecutor to defense lawyer or vice versa. You may also consider working at a policy level by advising legislatures on criminal justice reform measures. Core Courses If you focus on criminal law, you should take the following courses.
