Carter Brown Architecture Lectures Performances Workshops Blog 5th-year M.A. The Center for Public Humanities offers the fifth-year Master's in Public Humanities program to current undergraduate students. Current Brown University undergraduates may be considered for admission to the Public Humanities M.A. program under a slightly expedited program. Students who apply and are admitted to the M.A. program during their senior year can count two classes completed as an undergraduate toward their graduate degree. All other program requirements for the Master's degree, including class requirements and practicums, must be fulfilled as specified here. Although the University terms this a “5th-year M.A.,” most students will need at least three semesters to complete all program requirements. Students interested in applying for the 5th-year Master's in Public Humanities program are required to contact Director of Graduate Studies prior to submitting the application, and must apply before they graduate via the Graduate School Application portal. GRE is not required for the 5th-year M.A. application. The 5th-year M.A. application deadline for Fall 2022 admission is May 1, 2022. Admitted students may defer matriculation for up to two years. Deferrals must be discussed and approved by the program before they are officially requested on the Graduate School Application portal. For more information, see information about the 5th-year Master’s Degree on the Graduate School website.
