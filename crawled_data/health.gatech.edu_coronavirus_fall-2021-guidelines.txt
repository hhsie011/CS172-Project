No student, faculty, or staff member should be treated differently based on their Covid-19 vaccination status. Students should not be asked about their vaccination status and segregated in a classroom or from other instructor-student interactions (e.g., office hours, group work, field trips, labs, etc.) based on their vaccination status. Vaccination status can be used to determine whether a person should quarantine after a close contact with a person who tests positive for Covid-19. Masks/face coverings are not required on campus. University System of Georgia encourages masks based on preference and assessment of personal risk. Two exceptions may apply on campuses – health center/medical facility and public transit. Institutions will return to campus in the fall with no social distancing measures. Unvaccinated individuals are strongly encouraged to continue social distancing whenever possible. Students in Experiential/Clinical Placements Students may be required by off-campus partnering organizations to wear masks and/or be vaccinated as a condition of participation in experiential learning opportunities such as study abroad programs, externships, and delivery of medical services. Health Centers/Medical Personnel Medical providers may use a patient’s Covid-19 vaccination status as they would normally under the typical standard of care. Consistent with the normal standard of care, medical providers may ask for proof of Covid-19 vaccination in treating patients. Contact Tracing/Contact Notification In the context of contact notification/contact tracing, personnel conducting the notification may ask a person’s vaccination status and may ask for proof of vaccination; however, proof is not required. Accommodations Approval of all Covid-19 related accommodations and flexible work arrangements (including telework) expired June 30, 2021.
