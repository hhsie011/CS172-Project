Photographs and printed materials offer a glimpse of the early years of the partnership as well as the depth of personal change experienced by participants in the exchange. From Civil Rights to the present, Tougaloo has provided the Brown community with an important perspective on social activism, lingering inequalities, and education. The Transformations exhibit goes up on May 12, 2014 and will be on display until August 15, 2014. Members of the general public wishing to to view exhibits at the Rockefeller Library should first check in at the service desk.
