With the participation of: Will Slauter, historian, Université Paris Diderot Julia Cagé, economist, Sciences Po Paris; Jenny Davidson, literary scholar, Columbia University Antoine Lilti, historian, École des hautes études en sciences sociales About the book You can't copyright facts, but is news a category unto itself? Without legal protection for the "ownership" of news, what incentive does a news organization have to invest in producing quality journalism that serves the public good? This book explores the intertwined histories of journalism and copyright law in the United States and Great Britain, revealing how shifts in technology, government policy, and publishing strategy have shaped the media landscape. Publishers have long sought to treat news as exclusive to protect their investments against copying or "free riding." But over the centuries, arguments about the vital role of newspapers and the need for information to circulate have made it difficult to defend property rights in news. Beginning with the earliest printed news publications and ending with the Internet, Will Slauter traces these countervailing trends, offering a fresh perspective on debates about copyright and efforts to control the flow of news. Panelists Will Slauter is an associate professor at Université Paris Diderot and a member of the Institut universitaire de France. His research interests include the history of authorship and publishing, the history of journalism, and the history of copyright law. After receiving a PhD from Princeton University in 2007, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Society of Fellows in the Humanities at Columbia University. He has also taught at Florida State University and Université Paris 8 – Saint Denis. His book Who Owns the News? A History of Copyright (Stanford University Press, 2019) was supported by fellowships from the John W. Kluge Center of the Library of Congress, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the American Antiquarian Society. In collaboration with Marie-Stéphanie Delamaire of the Winterthur Museum, he is currently coordinating an international project on artistic copyright and the circulation of images in the nineteenth century.
