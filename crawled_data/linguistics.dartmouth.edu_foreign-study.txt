Information on the program — for both linguistics and anthropology majors — is available on the Anthropology website. The director of the FSP is a professor from Dartmouth Anthropology. The students on the linguistics side of the program take courses in Maori Language (LING 8), an Anthropology course on Colonialism (ANTH 51), and a Linguistics course on field linguistics and language documentation (LING 54). LING 8 is taught by a local University of Auckland instructor. ANTH 51 is taught by the Dartmouth FSP director (Anthropology). LING 54 is taught by a Dartmouth Linguistics professor who spends approximately 6 weeks teaching on-site in Auckland with the program. As part of LING 54, Linguistics students and professor spend 7-10 days of hands-on field linguistics experience in an island nation in the South Pacific, such as Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Linguistics Undergraduate Overview About Linguistics Learning Outcomes Courses Major/Minor Modified Minor Computational Linguistics Major Undergraduate Research Opportunities Student Presentations and Publications Honors Past Honors Theses Awards and Prizes Alumni and their Career Paths Foreign Study Research Overview Faculty Research Recent Grants Undergraduate Research Opportunities Student Presentations and Publications Linguistics Lab Research Roundtable Linguistic Discovery (Dartmouth journal) DARLA: Dartmouth Linguistic Automation News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
