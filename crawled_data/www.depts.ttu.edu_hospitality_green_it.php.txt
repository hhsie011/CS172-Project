Red, black & green Hospitality Services continually strives to be more sustainable and to lessen the carbon footprint we leave behind. Through our department's efforts and university partnerships, Hospitality Services is continually working to make Texas Tech University a greener campus! Raider refills Each year the food industry distributes millions of paper and plastic cups and single-use water bottles to their customers. These beverage containers create vast amounts of pollution during the manufacturing process and most are never recycled. Hospitality Services has implemented the Raider Refill program, which contributes to saving the environment. We are selling environmentally friendly, refillable beverage containers in our retail locations in an effort to cut down on beverage container waste. We would like to encourage you to use this refillable bottle instead of disposable beverage containers to enhance your Hospitality Services experience and protect the environment. Refill your beverage at a reduced price at our retail locations and FREE with the purchase of a meal at AYCE @ Hulen/Clement, The Fresh Plate @ Bledsoe/Gordon and Smart Choices @ Horn/Knapp locations.
