AggieBuy is a web-based e-Commerce system developed by Texas A&M University, in partnership with JAGGAER, which replaces the purchasing functionality previously provided by FAMIS and the Buy A&M (BAM) system. Customers may browse and shop from numerous online catalogs (each of which is accessible directly through the AggieBuy UI) and Texas A&M Contracts, or place orders to virtually any supplier through a "non-catalog/non-contract" requisitioning process. Invoices and payment requests are initiated and created within AggieBuy, which is fully integrated with FAMIS. What are the benefits of AggieBuy? It provides a one-stop shopping experience with virtually all suppliers—no need to remember multiple web sites or set up individual accounts and profiles with individual suppliers. Similar to other online shopping sites, products may be searched by keyword, part number, category, or "favorites" lists. Real cost savings—Texas A&M's contracts and "best value" sources are readily accessible. Quicker turnaround since there are no delegated dollar limits on orders placed with contracted suppliers. Requisitions are automatically budget-checked and routed through a department's specified Approval Workflow. Invoicing is centralized and automated, which minimizes or eliminates paper invoice processing and Payment Card receipts and reconciliation reports. Provides greater spend visibility, reporting, and analysis.
