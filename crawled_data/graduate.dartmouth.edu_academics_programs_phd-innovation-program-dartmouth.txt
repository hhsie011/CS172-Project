PreviousNext The Program The Guarini School for Graduate and Advanced Studies has teamed up with Associate Provost for Entrepreneurship and Technology Transfer, Eric Fossum, to expand the Innovation PhD Program that has been running with great success at the Thayer School of Engineering since 2008. Prof. Fossum has served as Director of the program at Thayer since 2010. The purpose of the training program is to build the skills and knowledge necessary to create a new enterprise — such as a start-up company, a new division of an established company, or a government or non-profit enterprise. At Thayer, students have gone on to create startups based on their PhD research, or have become valuable early members of other startups. Some have joined established companies but are prepared to create an enterprise when opportunity knocks. Applications to this highly selective program are open to Guarini PhD students who are outside the Engineering program and who are in their first or second year of study. Learn more about the program HERE. If you are admitted into the Innovation PhD Fellowship Program you will receive 50% stipend support for your second and third years. Following satisfactory performance, you will receive 100% stipend support for your fourth and fifth years as well as research funds for up to three years to allow you to follow your ideas independent of your advisor's funded research program. Students in the program will be expected to complete four courses and a 3-6 month internship in addition to their program PhD courses and requirements, although Programs can decide at their discretion to apply one or more of these courses towards PhD requirements. The courses are: ENGM 187: Technology Innovation and Entrepreneurship ENGM 180: Corporate Finance ENGM 188: Law for Technology and Entrepreneurship ENGG 321: Introduction to Innovation (capstone course) Application Details Students interested in applying should submit a single PDF containing the following to: Guarini.Graduate.School@dartmouth.edu · Curriculum Vitae (3-page max) · Statement (2-page max) describing: reasons for interest in the Innovation PhD Program why the program is relevant to your long-term career goals an example demonstrating creativity in arriving at a solution · Statement (2-page max) describing an example of a broad technology development problem that interests you.
