The University Registrar will notify the student’s dean (or the dean’s designee), who will determine the student’s graduation status. If approved, the dean (or the dean’s designee) will inform the University Registrar of the degree to be awarded. The University awards degrees only at the conclusion of the fall semester, spring semester, or summer session; however, there is only one commencement ceremony each year in May.
