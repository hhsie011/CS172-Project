The 5-year integrated Undergraduate/MPH (UG/MPH) degree is a rigorous program in professional public health education open to Brown undergraduates of any concentration. Students accepted into the program will complete the degree requirements for both their undergraduate degree and an MPH degree in a five-year period. Students must take 12 total course credits toward the MPH (5.5 during their first four years and 6.5 courses in the fifth year). Requirements can be found here. Students work closely with faculty to design an academic program that meets the core requirements of both the undergraduate degree and the MPH degree, while tailoring the courses, internship experience and thesis to the educational goals of the individual students. Students graduating from the program will be in an excellent position to enter careers in public health research or public health practice. Graduates will also have excellent backgrounds to enter medical school, doctorate programs in public health areas or other advanced degree options including law, public policy, the sciences or humanities.

No more than two courses can be used to meet requirements of both the undergraduate concentration and the MPH degree.
