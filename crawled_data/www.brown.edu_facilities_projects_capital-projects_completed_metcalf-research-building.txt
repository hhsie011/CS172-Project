Brown University renovated approximately 74,000 gsf within the existing Metcalf Chemistry Laboratory and Metcalf Research Laboratory, which are part of the larger Metcalf Complex. The overall scope of the project included a complete interior and exterior renovation of the buildings originally designed by Charles Klauder. Exterior improvements included a new slate roof and historically appropriate windows, as well as masonry restoration. The interior renovations provide all new office and dry lab spaces for faculty, staff, and students with the addition of new classroom spaces, meeting and conference rooms, and a new public lobby space. Sarah Oppenheimer, ’05, designed the Public Art space located at the courtyard entrance to Metcalf. The space provides open views between the basement level of the building and the outdoors, and created puzzling and disorienting illusions. The completely renovated auditorium is a fully accessible state-of-the-art teaching space. The renovation achieved a LEED Gold rating from the USGBC.
