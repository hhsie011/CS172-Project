Questions about your certification or other matters can be directed to Cornell’s VA Representative (vaedben@cornell.edu), 607-255-4232. Yellow Ribbon Program Cornell University has entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program, a supplement to the post-9/11 educational benefit that further defrays the cost of higher education for military veterans. Veterans eligible for VA benefits should contact their Veterans Administration regional office for eligibility. (Please note, if you are currently on active duty status and you are 100% post-9/11 eligible, you will need to be released from active duty no later than August 1 to use the full VA benefit. Once you have obtained your certificate of eligibility letter from the VA, please forward to Cornell’s Office of the University Registrar, who will process all forms.) For further information, please visit the VA website. Cortland County’s Veteran Return The FAVOR Program This program discounts from local merchants, to veterans of record. Any veteran who has their DD214 on file with the Cortland County Clerk’s office can receive a Return the FAVOR identification card. If the DD214 is not on file, the Clerk’s office staff are more than happy to complete this process. Veteran Status Designation on an ID If you are a qualified U.S. military veteran who was honorably discharged, and you have a NYS driver license, learner permit, or non-driver photo ID card, you can have the word “Veteran” printed on the upper left hand of your photo document. Veterans Day Free Meals, Discounts, Sales, and Deals Many restaurants offer free meals on or around Veterans Day. Special Extra Earnings for Military Service Under certain circumstances, special extra earnings for your military service from 1957 through 2001 can be credited to your record for Social Security purposes. These extra earnings credits may help you qualify for Social Security or increase the amount of your Social Security benefit. Free Admission to National Parks Since Veterans Day 2020, Gold Star Families and U.S. military veterans are eligible to receive free access to more than 2,000 federal recreation areas, including national parks, wildlife refuges, and forests. The free access program is a way to thank America’s veterans, Gold Star Families, and current military and their dependents for their support of our country and to encourage them to explore recreational opportunities on their public lands and waters. Additional Resources Team RWB Ithaca and Headstrong Project Team RWB Ithaca is thrilled to be able to partner with another amazing organization in our local community, Headstrong Project.

Land Acknowledgement Cornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' (the Cayuga Nation). The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
