Emphasis is placed on mathematics, basic physical principles and engineering fundamentals. While the focus is on applied science rather than technical training, most Brown undergraduates also gain valuable technical experience through independent study and close relationships with research faculty. Here is a listing of all engineering courses offered during the current academic year. For the most up to date and authoritative information, please consult Banner and Courses@Brown. Science, Technology, and Society The courses listed below are from Science, Technology, and Society (STS), and may be of interest to engineering students. STS examines the processes of scientific discovery and the establishment of scientific policies and systems of belief from historical, philosophical, anthropological, and sociological perspectives. The courses do not meet any engineering requirements, and students should consult with their concentration advisor about specific program questions.
