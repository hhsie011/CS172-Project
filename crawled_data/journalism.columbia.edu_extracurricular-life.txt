From the Dominican bodegas of Manhattan’s Washington Heights to the Hasidic synagogues of Brooklyn’s Borough Park; from the Irish soccer leagues of Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx to the Guyanese chutney clubs of Richmond Hill, Queens; living and learning in New York City is an experience that can be replicated in few places on earth. Columbia students have free access or discounts to many museums and cultural events through the University’s Arts Initiative. See Exploring New York City for other guides to the vast opportunities for work and play in the city.
