Students pay the in-state tuition rate for most programs. The most notable exception is that Georgia Tech – Lorraine charges out-of-state students an additional $5,000 in tuition. This tuition differential will increase beginning in Fall 2020. Please refer to the Costs page on the Georgia Tech – Lorraine webpage for details. Program cost estimates account for the cost of attendance—which includes: tuition, fees, room and board, mandatory insurance coverage, books and supplies, airfare, and misc. out-of-pocket expenses. This comparison is intended to be a guide. Please note programs do vary in length and number of credit hours earned, which will impact the overall program costs.
