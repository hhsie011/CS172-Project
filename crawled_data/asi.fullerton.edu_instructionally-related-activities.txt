An instructionally related activity should provide for the performance, competition, or laboratory experience outside of, but related to, the formal instructional offerings at Cal State Fullerton. The IRA fee is one of the several mandatory CSU student fees.” 2022-2023 IRA Application Process It is time to kick off the 2022-23 Instructionally Related Activities (IRA) budget process.
