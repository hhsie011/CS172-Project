However, the Honors College staff is readily available to assist students in meeting requirements. Honors students can submit the following form to request an update on the Honors Requirements they have completed. A member of the Honors College staff will respond to your request within 1-3 business days. Request Honors Progress Update > Probation & Removal from the Honors College Probation A student whose cumulative GPA falls below the minimum requirement will be placed on probation. Freshman & Sophomores: 3.0 Juniors & Seniors: 3.25 Students on probation may remain in the Honors College as long as each semester’s GPA is at least a 3.0, until the cumulative GPA is raised to the minimum requirement, at which time the student returns to good standing. Suspension A student on probation whose semester GPA is less than 3.0 will be suspended from the Honors College and lose all the privileges of membership. Students who do not complete an Honors course/contract or participate in an Honors Experience for two consecutive semesters (not including summer semester) will be removed from the Honors College due to non-participation. Please note: Membership in the Honors residential community in the Living Learning Complex (LLC) may be suspended for students who are removed from the Honors College, though suspension of a living arrangement in the LLC will generally not occur between semesters of an academic year (i.e., suspension of a living arrangement will not take place between fall and spring semesters). Special Circumstances Students who believe that their individual circumstances warrant special consideration may petition for an exception to the cumulative GPA/enrollment requirements for continuation in the program. The student must submit a written statement outlining any extenuating circumstances to the Director of the Honors College within fourteen days of being notified of ineligibility. The professional staff of the Honors College will carefully consider the petition and promptly notify students of the decision. Reinstatement of Membership Students who have been suspended from the program may request reinstatement to the program at a later date if their cumulative GPA meets the Honors College requirements. Requests for reinstatement must be made in writing, and may be granted if the student meets the following criteria: Has achieved the requisite 3.0 GPA (for freshmen and sophomores) or 3.25 GPA (for juniors and seniors) Has completed a sufficient amount of Honors credits to be on track to graduate with University Honors Grievances The Honors College follows all campus policies regarding academic and other grievances. In general, we advocate for individual meetings between student and instructor as the most important and first step. In any situation where you feel that step was not helpful or is inappropriate, be sure to schedule an appointment with the Director, who can assist with additional procedures. The Director is also available to assist you with campus policies for any other types of grievance concerns.
