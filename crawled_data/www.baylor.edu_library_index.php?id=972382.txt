In addition to providing a foundation of computing and storage capacity, Kodiak also supports a "condominium model" which allows researchers to purchase additional computing and storage resources that may be integrated into the HPC cluster infrastructure. Idle condominium resources are available for all Kodiak users. Kodiak’s computing resources, including condominium systems, consist of 92 compute nodes, six GPU nodes, one large-memory system, and 2.5PB of multi-tiered storage. The High-Performance and Research Computing Services (HPRCS) group operates Kodiak and provides programming support for researchers, assists with research-technology projects, and liaises with central IT services on behalf of researchers.
