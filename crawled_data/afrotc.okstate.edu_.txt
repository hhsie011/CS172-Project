AFROTC is an educational and experiential program designed to train leaders for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Space Force and build better citizens for America. We accomplish this through an integrated program that engaes cadets in Academics, Physical Fitness, Leadership, and Training. Per Oklahoma Senate Bill 138, all ROTC participants in the State of Oklahoma are now considered as 'in-state' students with respect to tuition, housing, fees, and all other costs!
