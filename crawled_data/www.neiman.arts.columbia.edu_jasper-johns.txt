The etching contains visual references to the artist's earlier paintings, Perilous Night, 1982 and According to What?, 1964, as well as the more recent intaglio Untitled, 2011 published by Universal Limited Art Editions. One of the most important printmakers of the 20th century, Johns continues to push the boundaries of the medium and create endlessly inventive images using a repeating lexicon of images. Johns created his first lithographs at Universal Limited Art Editions in 1960 and printmaking has continued to play a vital role in his practice ever since. Born in Georgia in 1930, Johns grew up in South Carolina and promptly moved to New York after two semesters at the University of South Carolina. In the early 1950s, he was introduced to Robert Rauschenberg, John Cage, and Merce Cunningham, a legendary network of artists whose work would influence his own. By the mid-1950s, Johns began to develop an essential bridge between Abstract Expressionism and Pop Art. He has received international acclaim for his work in painting, drawing, sculpture and printmaking and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011, the first painter to receive this award since 1977.
