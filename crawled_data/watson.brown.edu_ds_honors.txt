Grades of "S" are equivalent to a "B" a thesis judged by the advisor AND reader as meriting honors (a grade of "A"). Honors will not be awarded by the University retroactively. Therefore, students who do not complete their required work on schedule will not be able to receive honors, even if all requirements are completed at a later time.
