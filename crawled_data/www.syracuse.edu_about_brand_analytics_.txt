Additionally, any third-party vendor or partner who requests analytics access must sign our Analytics Agreement. GTM includes the Syracuse University Common Tracker (“UA-32597848-1”) which provides a holistic view of traffic as users move through different pages and sites within our web presence. Adding GTM Paste this code in the <head> of the page below closing </title> and above closing </head> : <!-- Google Tag Manager --> <script>(function(w,d,s,l,i){w[l]=w[l]||[];w[l].push({'gtm.start': new Date().getTime(),event:'gtm.js'});var f=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0], j=d.createElement(s),dl=l!='dataLayer'?'&l='+l:'';j.async=true;j.src= 'https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id='+i+dl;f.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f); })(window,document,'script','dataLayer','GTM-5FC97GL');</script> <!-- End Google Tag Manager --> Additionally, paste this code immediately after the opening <body> element: <!-- Google Tag Manager (noscript) --> <noscript><iframe src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-5FC97GL" height="0" width="0" style="display:none;visibility:hidden"></iframe></noscript> <!-- End Google Tag Manager (noscript) --> See the GTM Quick Start Guide for details on code placement. How GTM Works When a user visits your page, Google Tag Manager activates the tags it has been configured to use, such as the Syracuse University Common Tracker. This dynamically adds the Google Analytics tracking code directly into your page. Unlike previous static implementations of trackers, the GTM can be centrally managed, and it significantly reduces the need to go back into specific pages or sites for future tag reconfiguration. The GTM container (identified as “GTM-5FC97GL”) is a universal container managed by the Division of Communications and Marketing. If you already use a custom Google Analytics tracker, we can add it using GTM and configure it to fire only on the pages you wish to track. Data Provided by the Tracker GTM allows you to see not only how visitors use your pages but how those visits relate to the Syracuse University web presence as a whole because the Common Tracker is widely deployed. Marketing and Communications can provide you with data in a couple of ways: via analytics dashboards using Google Data Studio , or via access to a traditional Google Analytics view. If you use a custom tracker your data from that tracker will continue to be available separately. For more information on how you can take advantage of richer data via GTM and the Common Tracker, please get in touch . Other Benefits GTM makes it easier to apply changes to your pages and campaigns without needing to change any code: updates to included tags like Google Analytics will be applied automatically, we can add campaign tags for you through GTM, and immediate changes to the tracker for improvements in the analytics framework (new tags, data layer variables, etc.).
