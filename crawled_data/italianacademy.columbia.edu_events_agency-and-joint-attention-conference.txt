The conference brings together researchers focused on the concepts of agency and joint attention. Our main focus will be on the antecedents and the development of these cognitive skills. The conference participants are a diverse group of scholars who have investigated these issues from a variety of perspectives. Some have argued for the uniqueness of agency and joint attention in humans while others believe that some of the precursors exist in non-human primates.
