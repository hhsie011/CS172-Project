The BTPC faculty are engaged in research in strongly correlated matter; interdisciplinary studies of cosmology, astrophysics, and condensed matter; quantum information science; climate and environmental physics; theoretical particle physics, quantum field theory, and mathematical foundations and symmetries. Website The Center for the Fundamental Physics of the Universe (CFPU) The Brown Center for the Fundamental Physics of the Universe will unite Brown’s Astrophysics and Cosmology group with Brown’s Experiment Particle Physics group. Together CFPU researchers will study the origin, evolution, composition, and fate of the Universe (see Figure 1) in a cohesive approach not possible with individual work. CFPU will address many of the most vexing and fundamental unsolved problems in physics and will be better able to do this by combining research strengths in new ways.
