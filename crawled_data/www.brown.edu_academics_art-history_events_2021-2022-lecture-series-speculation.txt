The series resumes with the Anita Glass Memorial Lecture, presented by Chika Okeke-Agulu (Princeton University) and entitled, "El Anatsui's Metamorphic Objects." On Speculation continues throughout the academic year with scholars and artists who have been invited by the Department to provoke new questions about and imagine visionary new approaches to, historical and contemporary art objects and architectures. The invited speakers span geographies and cultures from around the world, as well as ranging from the medieval to our present time period. They will help us conceive of and understand visible changes in our world – in climate, the migrations of people, colonization, the loss and gain of goods, methods of exoticism and exchange, and more.
