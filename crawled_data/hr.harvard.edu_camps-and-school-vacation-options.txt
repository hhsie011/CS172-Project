Every summer, we know many parents try to find engaging activities to keep their kids busy — never an easy task. Provided by Ed Navigator, Camp Kinda is an exploratory learning experience designed to keep kids ages 3-13 engaged, curious, and having fun over the summer. It’s like summer camp (kinda). Camp Kinda was initially an invention born from the necessity of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has become a flexible, virtual summer learning experience that fills the gaps between parks, pools, in-person camps, and dinnertime. It’s not summer school. No worksheets. But kids cannot help but learn. Developed by education professionals and parents, it includes more than 250 hours of daily on- and offline activities that kids can complete on their own schedule, as well as special “CK Jr.” adventures specifically for younger children (ages 3-6).
