Credits directly reduce the amount of income tax owed, while deductions reduce the amount of taxable income upon which taxes are computed. University reporting of expenses and aid received Per IRS regulation*, the UW reports all tuition payments in Box 1, financial aid, grant or scholarship payment information for students in Box 5 on the 1098T with the detail information from the student's acount on the UW layout format. This 1098T information is reported for the current calendar year only. Amounts prepaid for future quarters/years will not be reported. Expenses for books, supplies and/or equipment are not reported to the IRS. Students must keep the receipts and report these expenses when filing a tax return.
