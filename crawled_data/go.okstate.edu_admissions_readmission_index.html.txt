Students must submit an updated application for admission and scholarships along with the application fee or fee waiver. A student who has enrolled in another university since last attending OSU must also submit an updated transcript from each institution attended. A returning service member whose enrollment was interrupted due to full time active duty service obligations may request reactivation of their student status from the Office of the Registrar and submit the Military Leave of Absence and Intent to Return from Military Leave of Absence forms along with official orders. Both forms and supporting orders may be submitted to the Office of the Registrar after the student returns from military service, but are required prior to re-enrollment at OSU. See Military Leave of Absence FAQs for additional information about Military Leave of Absence. Who counts as a readmission applicant?
