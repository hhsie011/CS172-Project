The form should include any medical information that is pertinent to your ongoing care – particularly around current treatment and prescriptions, as well as your immunization records. Columbia Health does not share this information, or any other information about your health, with anyone without your written permission. Complete the form online via the Columbia Health secure patient portal. How Information is Used The Health History will be reviewed by a Columbia Health professional, and based upon responses, students may receive information about on-campus resources to ensure a smooth transition to Columbia Health. Connect with Columbia Health early – meet Primary Care Clinicians (PCP) in Medical Services, talk to a counselor in Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS), register Disability Services (DS), or make use of the many other resources that are available through Columbia Health.
