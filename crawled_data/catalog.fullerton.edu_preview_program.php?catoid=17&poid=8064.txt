Graduates with a master’s degree in chemistry are prepared to enter any of these fields or others, since chemistry is the central science with connections to physics and mathematics, biology and medicine, and environmental sciences. According to the American Chemical Society, the national professional association for chemists, “Many predict a growing role for chemistry as we tackle the major issues confronting the world in the 21st century: providing energy, responding to regulation, protecting the environment, improving health and feeding the world.” Admission Requirements Students must meet the CSU requirements for admission to a master’s degree program. Please consult the Graduate Admissions section in this catalog for complete information. In addition, applicants must meet the following requirements: Bachelor’s degree in chemistry, biochemistry or a related field from an accredited college or university. Those with degrees in other disciplines are encouraged to apply provided they have had at least a year of each of general and organic chemistry courses, including laboratories. Additional coursework may be required to make up the deficiencies A minimum 2.75 GPA Take a subject Graduate Record Examination (GRE).
