Housing and Dining Credits for Columbia College and Columbia Undergraduate Engineering Students Columbia University has credited or refunded a portion of Spring 2020 housing and dining fees to reflect an adjustment for the time period following a student’s completed move out of campus housing. Credits/refunds for students whose residential charges were paid by institutional aid have received prorated credits or refunds reflecting the portion of charges paid by the student. Every student has received no less than a $1,200 refund, regardless of aided status, to assist our students with off-campus living expenses. Specific details were communicated to each student by email by Tuesday, April 14. In recognition that some on-campus services and facilities were no longer available for the spring term, the University additionally credited or refunded $144, representing a portion of the Student Life fee. We processed any credits to students’ accounts beginning Monday, April 13, and issued any refunds shortly thereafter. Once these adjustments were processed, students received a confirmation by email with additional details. Tuition and Fees for All Columbia Students - Spring In recognition that some on-campus services and facilities were no longer available for the spring term, the University rebated a portion of the Morningside Facilities fee and Student Life fee that relates to printing services (for undergraduates only), Athletics and Lerner Hall (for all Morningside students). Undergraduate students received a credit for $144, and other Columbia students received a credit for $119. Please note that CUIMC students were not assessed these fees, Executive MBA and Executive MPA students were not assessed the components being rebated, and fully funded PhD students had these fees paid by schools. A credit was not processed in these cases. Schools have also processed rebates or refunds of certain fees. These were to be communicated directly to students by their schools. We processed any credits to students’ accounts beginning Monday, April 13, and issued any refunds shortly thereafter. Once these adjustments were processed, students received a confirmation by email with additional details. The University moved swiftly to ensure instruction continued throughout the spring semester and students could earn full credit for the semester's work. Tuition and fees continued to pay for the delivery of instruction, as well as the associated costs of academic support services. As long as instruction continued, tuition would not be refunded. Tuition and Fees for All Columbia Students - Summer Due to summer being an online term as a result of COVID-19, the Morningside Facilities fee (Student Life fee for undergraduates) will be reduced in recognition that certain services are not available. In the summer term, the component which covers Athletic facilities will not be included. As a result, any students assessed the Facilities fee will pay only the IT component. Morningside students registered for 12 or more points will pay $249, rather than $496. Morningside students registered for fewer than 12 points, rather than pay $247, will not be assessed a fee. Late Fees for All Columbia Students To further help minimize the financial hardship that Columbia students and families may experience during the COVID-19 outbreak, the University did not assess late fees on unpaid student account balances in the March and April billing cycles. The University will also not assess late fees in the May billing cycle. Student Financial Hardship We recognize these are extremely challenging and unique times. If you are a student experiencing financial hardship or are unable to register for an upcoming term as a result of account balances, please contact your school's financial aid office for assistance.
