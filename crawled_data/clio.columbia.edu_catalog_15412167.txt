Start Over Cotopaxi Creator Church, Frederic Edwin, 1826-1900, artist. Title Cotopaxi. Produced United States, 1857. Physical Properties 1 painting ; 13 1/2 x 21 1/4 in. (34.3 x 54 cm); with frame: 18 1/2 x 26 5/8 in. (47 x 67.7 cm) Oil on canvas mounted on board. Inscription Signed lower left: F. CHURCH / 57 / COTOPAXI Description This painting shows the volcano Cotopaxi in Ecuador spewing lava, ash, and smoke. From an elevated hillside, the viewer looks across an extensive green plain toward the majestic geological formation that rises in the distance. The contrast between the smoking cone and the craggy mountains before it contributes to the striking quality of the image. Notes This picture belongs to a series of at least ten paintings and several drawings linked to Church’s two visits to Ecuador in 1853 and 1857. The artist painted it either during or shortly after his second trip in 1857. The craggy structure in front of Cotopaxi probably represents the dormant and heavily eroded stratovolcano Rumiñawi.
