Also in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic began, raising a host of issues around complex medical management and racial/ethnic disparities in health and health care and adding urgency to the need for experienced APRNs to have robust academic and clinical education in palliative care. This certificate program takes a true lifespan approach addressing palliative care for perinatal, pediatric, adult and geriatric patients and families. Instructors are practicing Columbia Nursing faculty with specialty certification. APRNs who complete the CPA in palliative care will gain the knowledge and skill to provide evidence-based, competent, and compassionate care to patients and families as well as support to caregiver colleagues. To reach a wide national and international audience of APRNs, the 12-credit certificate program will be offered online in a synchronous and asynchronous format. Upon completion you will: Be positioned to champion palliative care nursing in clinical settings and schools of nursing. Become a member of the palliative care nursing community, committed to setting and upholding evidenced-based clinical practice to move the field forward.
