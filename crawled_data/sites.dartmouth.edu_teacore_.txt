Skip to content Dartmouth Trace Element Analysis Core Low-level elemental analysis, speciation and imaging Menu Welcome Contact us Science Highlights Publications Services and Pricing Scroll down to content Welcome The Trace Element Analysis (TEA) laboratory specializes in low-level trace metal analysis and speciation in environmental and biological samples. We use inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for metals analysis and several “hyphenated” techniques that couple instruments together for speciation analyses of water, soil and biological tissue samples. The TEA Core is supported by Dartmouth’s Superfund Research Program, Sources and Protracted Effects of Early Life Exposure to Arsenic and Mercury and the Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Cancer Support Grant and provides analytical support and method development for all the researchers in these programs. The Core also supports the Geisel Medical School Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes program in addition to all other Dartmouth researchers requiring elemental analysis. We also accept samples for analysis from other academic institutions. The TEA Core specializes in: Low level element analysis in biological and environmental samples such as urine, toenails, blood, serum or plasma, animal or human tissues, water and food, soils, sediments Arsenic speciation in soils, food, waters and urine Mercury speciation in waters, soils, sediment and biological tissues Laser ablation imaging of biological tissues and trace element analysis of teeth and hair The Dartmouth Trace Element Analysis Core is funded by grant P42ES007373 from the National Institute of Health Site Map Welcome Methods Mercury speciation Arsenic speciation Sample preparation: liquids and solids Quality Control ICP-MS methods Services and Pricing Publications Brian P.
