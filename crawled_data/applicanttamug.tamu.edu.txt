The first step is filling out an application for admission. After you have applied, you will use your NetID to login for access to many campus resources. The Applicant Information System (AIS) allows you to see exactly where your application is in the process. The HOWDY portal is a one-stop site for news, resources, and student information. NEED HELP?
