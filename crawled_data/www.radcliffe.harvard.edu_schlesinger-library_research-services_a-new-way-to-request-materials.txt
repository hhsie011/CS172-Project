Share Share this page on Facebook Share this page on Twitter Share this page on LinkedIn Copy Link HOLLIS Special Request is available to Harvard and non-Harvard researchers and can be used at any participating Harvard library or archive. All researchers will need to have a HOLLIS Special Request account to request Schlesinger Library materials. (Note: If you have an existing HOLLIS Special Request account you use to request from Harvard’s other special collections libraries, that account also works for the Schlesinger Library’s materials!) With your HOLLIS Special Request account you can: Request material to view in a reading room Track the status and history of your requests Order copies of materials Save lists of material to be requested later Nearly all collection materials, including books, periodicals, and manuscript collections, can be requested through HOLLIS, Harvard library’s online catalog. Requests for manuscript and archival material can also be made directly from finding aids (guides describing the contents of archival collections) in HOLLIS for Archival Discovery. Researchers are encouraged to place requests for materials in advance of your visit so we can confirm access to items with restrictions or arrange for delivery if stored off-site. For more information, check out the HOLLIS Special Request guide for advice and tips.
