An accommodation plan describes how people can request assistance, how the request will be handled, and the length of time the assistance can be expected to take. Yale provides a template for creating accommodation plans: Digital Accessibility Accommodation Plan Sharing the accommodation plan with the ITS Digital Accessibility team will assist IT support providers such as the Help Desk in directing users to the appropriate services for assistance. You can email an accommodation plan to the accessibility team via accessibility@yale.edu. The team is also available to assist in the creation of accommodation plans. Per the Web Accessibility Policy, all University websites should have an easy-to-find link to a page explaining Yale’s commitment to accessibility and providing a way to report accessibility issues. You can find more information about this from the Web Accessibility Procedure. For sites requiring an accommodation plan, it may be beneficial to also provide a direct link or phone number for requesting help, such as “Contact xyz for accessibility assistance.” Additional NavigationClose Web Accessibility Accessibility at Yale Frequently Asked Questions New Projects Compliance & Exceptions Accessibility Statement Page Accommodation Plans Accessibility Comments and Suggestions Form University Policy University Procedure Working with Vendors Training Articles Accessibility Updates Yale UI Component Library Yale Accessibility at Yale · Privacy policy Copyright © 2022 Yale University · All rights reserved Yale ITS Services Website Consultation and Build Usability Consulting and Research Accessibility Consulting, Tools and Training Website Consulting and Build Contact ux@yale.edu accessibility@yale.edu Zoom in/out Toggle fullscreen Share Close (Esc) Previous (arrow left) Next (arrow right)
