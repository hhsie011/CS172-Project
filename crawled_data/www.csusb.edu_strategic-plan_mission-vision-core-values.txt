Mission Statement CSUSB ensures student learning and success, conducts research, scholarly and creative activities, and is actively engaged in the vitality of our region. We cultivate the professional, ethical, and intellectual development of our students, faculty and staff so they thrive and contribute to a globally connected society. Core Values As a university community, these core values are the driving force that moves us to accomplish our mission and goals: Inclusivity We affirm and are committed to the value of all kinds of differences among students, faculty and staff. Inclusivity that is broad and deep makes us a healthier and more productive organization and builds a culture that fosters engagement and diverse perspectives. Innovation We support and believe in an innovative culture and attitude that fosters the creative and deliberate application of teaching, research, scholarship and service for effective education. Integrity We affirm and are committed to the truth. We demonstrate our integrity by being ethical, matching what we say with what we do, and by ultimately taking responsibility for our actions. Respect We believe in and are committed to the virtue of respect and will treat everyone with courtesy and kindness. Social Justice and Equity We believe in, affirm, and are committed to the equal value and dignity of all people. Fairness and equity are more than equality. We actively seek to eliminate barriers for those who are disadvantaged and disempowered so they may participate fully in university life. Sustainability We affirm and are committed to the sustainability of our university by forward thinking, learning from both successes and mistakes, being proactive in moving our university forward, and by providing opportunities for continued growth and development. Transparency We affirm and are committed to the importance of transparency both internally and externally. We believe in honesty and openness in our decisions and processes, subject to legal and ethical confidentialities. Understanding we are a public institution, we are also up front and open to the community and residents that we serve about the decisions we make and the actions we take. Wellness and Safety We affirm and are committed to protecting and enhancing the health, wellness and safety of ourselves, our colleagues, our students and our stakeholders. We believe a healthy university is one in which there is collegial collaboration and uses continuous improvement processes that ensure a safe and healthy workplace for all.
