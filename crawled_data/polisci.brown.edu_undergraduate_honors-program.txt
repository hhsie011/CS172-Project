Application Deadline: April 1 At the completion of six semesters, you must have successfully completed a minimum of eight Political Science courses and must have earned an A or S with distinction in at least five of the eight courses. Since the application is due prior to the end of the sixth semester, courses taken in the spring semester will be counted towards filling the requirement. The honors sequence is in addition to the required ten courses for political science. You must have completed your methods requirement prior to the beginning of your seventh semester. This can be filled by POLS0500 or POLS1600. Outside department courses that will also fill the requirement are: APMA0650, APMA1650, ANTH1940, CLPS0900, ECON1620, EDUC1100, EDUC1110, GEOL1320, PHP1501, SOC1020, SOC1100 or SOC1120 You will need to register for POLS1910 (Senior Honors Thesis Preparation) during pre- registration for the fall semester of your senior year and POLS1920 (Senior Honors Thesis Preparation) during pre-registration for the spring semester of your senior year. The Honors Sequence courses (POLS1910 and 1920) will fulfill the capstone seminar requirement. All applications are to be submitted electronically to suzanne_brough@brown.edu. Although you will be working with a faculty member who has agreed to be your advisor, the Honors Seminar will offer additional guidance and supervision, especially in the early stages of your thesis work. It is your responsibility to arrange for a thesis advisor, who is a faculty member in the political science department, as well as a second reader who is knowledgeable about your topic. Submit the application by the April 1st deadline. Note the application requires a copy of your internal transcript, a list of the political science courses you are currently taking, and a copy of a paper written for any social science course at Brown. Professor Cheit will contact you with a decision prior to pre-registration for the fall semester. The honors thesis is a one-year sequence course. You must enroll in POLS1910 and POLS1920. You will receive an INC for POLS1910 at the end of the fall 2022 semester. When you have completed your thesis in the spring of 2023, the letter grade you receive for the thesis will be entered for POLS1920 and your INC from the fall for POLS1910 will be changed to reflect that grade as well. All passing grades on the thesis earn course credit for POLS1910 and POLS1920. However, only an A earns honors.
