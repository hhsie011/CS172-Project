Change activities could include training, coaching and/or communication practices with the goal that the change brings the least amount of disruption and distress to the lives of users. Florida State University’s ITS recognizes the importance of preparing users for new or changing technology. To that end, the FSU OCM Center of Excellence (OCM CoE) works with individuals and groups to ensure resources are in place to transition FSU users to new technology through a seamless shift. The OCM team will plan, manage and reinforce the change through a systematic framework and customized approach which takes into consideration the unique needs at FSU; focuses on organizational change management framework and visible, engaged and proactive change leadership; and collaborates its efforts into the project management cycle to minimize risk and allows teams to fully meet their project objectives. Only 18% of participants in a recent study reported that their organizations were effective at defining what success looked like on a project. - Prosci The OCM Center of Excellence works primarily with major university initiatives, but Integrated Communications handles ITS projects big and small.
