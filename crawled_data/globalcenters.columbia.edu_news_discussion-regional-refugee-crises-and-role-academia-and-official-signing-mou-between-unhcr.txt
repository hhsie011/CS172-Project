The signing of the Memorandum of Understanding was followed by remarks by Mr. Amin Awad, on regional refugee crises including challenges and opportunities, and by Professor Safwan M.

The Impact of Separation on Refugee Families study was also presented during the remarks as the first example of operationalizing the agreement.

Regional collaboration between UNHCR and the Amman Center enables UNHCR MENA to better sensitize stakeholders, enhance advocacy, and strengthen the regional environment for refugee protection. There have been a number of collaborative efforts between UNHCR and the Amman Center including a recently concluded independent study that evaluates the impact of separation on Syrian refugee families in Jordan, and the Second Regional Academia Roundtable on Enhancing Dialogue and Partnership between Academia and UNHCR on Regional Displacement Crises.
