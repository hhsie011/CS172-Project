Occupying the center of our University seal, the star reflects our standing as the oldest, continuously operating university in the state of Texas. A new graphic interpretation of our star will become the emblem that represents our new vision, Pro Futuris. At the core of the new symbol, an inner star represents our steadfast commitment to the mission and essential values that have guided the university and will continue to lead us into the future. Surrounding this inner star, an outer star represents the five Aspirational Statements of Pro Futuris. Anchored by an unwavering commitment to the firm foundation upon which the university has grown and prospered, the five clear and inspired statements of Pro Futuris will propel us to new heights as we work together to see our vision realized in the days ahead. This graphic will be used throughout the duration of Pro Futuris to recognize and celebrate progress on the plans and projects that are advancing our vision.
