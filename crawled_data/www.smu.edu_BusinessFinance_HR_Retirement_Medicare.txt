A portion of the FICA tax paid by you and SMU is directed to Medicare funding. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is the federal agency that oversees Medicare. Medicare is different from Medicaid, which is a state and federal program offering health care coverage to people of most ages in certain groups (children and pregnant women, single parents, people with disabilities, and individuals age 65 and over), but generally only to those with low incomes.
