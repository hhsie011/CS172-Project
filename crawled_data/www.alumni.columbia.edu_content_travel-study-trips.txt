We are thrilled that you're thinking about your next adventure and hope everyone will save the dates to travel with alumni and friends . We are eager to help the alumni community to get out and explore together and look forward to the return of Alumni Travel programs as soon as we can. The health and safety of our alumni travelers and their guests is of the utmost importance and we are evaluating each upcoming travel program accordingly. For any alumni and friends with travel credits from postponed trips, our travel partners are running programs and you are welcome to coordinate independent arrangements with each respective tour operator directly. Please note that while the University is not yet ready to begin sponsorship of travel programs, those who are ready to use their credits and get out and travel and encouraged to do so directly with each respective travel partner according to the terms of your travel credit. Please contact the Alumni Travel Study Program office at [email protected] with any questions or for additional assistance with your upcoming Alumni Travel Study Program plans. The Alumni Travel Study Program will resume offering specially curated travel opportunities across the globe as soon as the University updates guidance allowing for the resumption of Alumni Travel. We look forward to helping you take epic adventures to destinations like Antarctica, river and ocean cruises, and small group experiential programs exploring local food, culture, and history.
