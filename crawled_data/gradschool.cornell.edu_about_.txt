About the Graduate School Cornell is one of the first institutions of higher education in the United States to offer advanced degrees, and one of the very first to admit women and African American students. Today, our Graduate School is an intellectually-stimulating, warm, vibrant community of nearly 100 fields of study. Vision and Mission Leadership Dean’s Statements Governance and Structure General Committee Roster History Ask a Dean How can I get funding to present a conference talk? How do I apply for parental leave? Who can I talk to about a confidential issue in my graduate field? How do I handle a difficult relationship in my field? Use the “Ask a Dean” program to get answers to your questions. Publications and Reports Using electronic and printed materials, the Graduate School celebrates and promotes our system of graduate education both internally and externally. Annual Reports Students in the News Program Metrics Graduate School Announcements Graduate School Alumni Newsletter Graduate School Original Stories Graduate School News You Belong at Cornell Safety and Security Reports Graduate and Professional Community Initiative The Graduate and Professional Community Initiative (GPCI) 2013, created by the Graduate and Professional Student Assembly in 2013 as a strategic five-year plan, provided a framework to identify and address issues related to graduate and professional student life. Progress reports as of Spring 2018 and Spring 2020 provide summaries of progress on GPCI-related issues that have been achieved through effective partnerships between graduate/professional students and many offices across campus, including the Graduate School. Union Representation Cornell Graduate Students United (CGSU), a group of graduate students interested in achieving labor union representation for graduate assistants at Cornell, is affiliated with the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) and New York State United Teachers (NYSUT). CGSU/AFT/NYSUT filed for a union representation election in Spring ’17. We created a Union Representation section of our website to address information needs of the Cornell community related to this important issue. Contacts As a large research institution, Cornell has a variety of offices and resources to help you navigate everything from application to graduation. Land Acknowledgement Cornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' (the Cayuga Nation). The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
