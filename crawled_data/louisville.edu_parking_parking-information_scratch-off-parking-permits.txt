These permits allow parking in any non-reserve, visitor, or HSC permit space on campus. Unfortunately these permits will not allow access to a gated lot or facility. To be valid, Scratch-Off permits must be properly and clearly displayed with the appropriate month, date, and year scratched off. Any scratch-off permit not displayed with the appropriate month, date, and year scratched off is invalid, and the vehicle is subject to receiving a citation. If multiple dates are scratched off then the permit will not be valid. To purchase one or more Scratch Off permits for $5 each please go directly to Parking & Transportation Services (2126 South Floyd Street, Suite #100).
