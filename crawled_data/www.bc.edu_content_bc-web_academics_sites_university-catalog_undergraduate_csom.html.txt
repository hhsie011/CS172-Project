of Management Accounting Business Analytics Business Law and Society Finance General Management Information Systems Management and Organization Marketing Carroll School of Management Founded in 1938, Boston College’s Carroll School of Management educates undergraduate students for careers in the various disciplines of management, as well as graduate students and practitioners who seek deeper insights into a complex global economy. The School has a dual mission: to carry out both top-level teaching and cutting-edge research. It sees this mission as a collaborative effort among faculty, staff, and students, in engagement with alumni and other management practitioners. A Carroll School education is a lively blend of the liberal arts and the functional areas of management. Undergraduates are introduced to a broad slate of topics related to accounting, business analytics, finance, information systems, business law, marketing, and other disciplines. But they are also encouraged to branch out and delve into subjects ranging from history and literature to natural science and the fine arts. Academic rigor and close interaction with faculty go hand in hand with this multidisciplinary approach. Situated within a Jesuit liberal arts university, the Carroll School helps its students cultivate the habits of intellectual discernment along with a commitment to service and the public good. There are numerous opportunities for students to apply their specialized knowledge to a vast array of human, social, and organizational challenges. In keeping with its philosophy of undergraduate management education, the Carroll School aims to: Teach analytical reasoning, problem solving, and communication skills to create effective leaders. Inform students of the latest advances in accounting, finance, data analytics, marketing, operations, and many other fields. Help students carve out a specialization in one or more fields, making them ready for management practice and leadership upon graduation. Provide them with the tools and inspiration to seek out, develop, and experiment with innovative ideas drawn from a wide mix of sources. Create a variety of programs that allow students to gain hands-on experience and apply theory to practice. Specialized research and education centers provide many of these opportunities. Develop a multicultural and global outlook, attentive to the needs of diverse communities and a fast-changing world. Emphasize the ethical responsibilities of managers and business and assist students in the development of their capacity for moral reasoning. Inculcate the habits of lifelong learning and self-reflection. Through the curriculum and other offerings, Carroll School students are taught to value both knowledge and wisdom, both hard skills and broader insights. They emerge from Boston College as capable professionals and thoughtful leaders ready to make a difference in their organizations and in their world. CSOM Courses CSOM Faculty CSOM Undergraduate Academics Website Print Open All Close All Information for First Year Students Information for First Year Students In most ways, the first year in the Carroll School of Management resembles the first year in the Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences. Carroll School of Management freshmen are expected to focus their study on aspects of the University's Core curriculum (described in the University Policies and Procedures section); the study of courses required in the Management Core, with the exceptions noted below, usually begins in earnest in sophomore year. All Carroll School freshmen will enroll in Portico (PRTO1000), a 3-credit course, offered in the fall semester, which combines an introduction to business with ethics and attention to globalization. During freshman year, Carroll students should also complete the Writing Seminar and Literature Core requirements, the Mathematics Core, and Business Statistics (BZAN1135). These five courses, or their equivalent via Advanced Placement, and Excel for Business Analytics (BZAN1037) are indispensable in the first year. Note that there is no necessary sequence for the above-mentioned courses; they may be taken in any order, either semester, during the first year. What other courses should a freshman pursue? Students contemplating study abroad should be aware that some programs require a language proficiency and may want to consider taking a relevant language course(s). Freshmen should also consider enrolling in one of the University's hallmark programs, PULSE or Perspectives, which fulfill both the Philosophy and the Theology Core requirements. Perspectives, with the exception of one sophomore section, is restricted to freshmen; PULSE may be taken at any time except senior year. Other possibilities for freshman year include the History sequence, Principles of Economics (ECON1101) plus one other Social Science core class, and a pair of science courses. While the preceding remarks capture a range of possibilities, even greater possibilities await a student possessed of Advanced Placement, transfer, or International Baccalaureate credit. Such students should consult carefully with the Senior Associate Dean and their faculty orientation advisor in crafting a plan of study for first year.

Students who have transferred, who have done a semester or a year abroad, or who have had deficiencies may have to modify their schedules somewhat. Students pursuing a minor in the Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences or the Lynch School of Education and Human Development may elect to eliminate one of the Carroll School core management courses. Students who complete the pre-medical program requirements (without a major or minor in MCAS) are eligible for this incentive as well. A student pursuing a major in the Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences may elect to eliminate two of the Carroll School core management courses. Selection of the eliminated courses must be done with advising from the Associate Dean's office. No one may eliminate Portico, Financial Accounting, Statistics, or Principles of Economics. Note: Students are not eligible to combine any of the incentives above (i.e., a student with two minors may not eliminate two courses). Prerequisites, which are listed in the individual course descriptions, must be followed. *Beginning with the Class of 2026, ISYS1021 Digital Technologies is no long required. **Beginning with the Class of 2025, students will be required to take BZAN1037 Excel for Business Analytics. ***Required core course for the Class of 2023. ****Beginning with the Class of 2024, BZAN2021 Coding for Business will be a required course replacing BZAN2235 Modeling for Business Analytics. Requirement for Good Standing Requirement for Good Standing Students must complete 120 credits to earn the bachelor's degree. To continue enrollment in a full-time program of study, a student must maintain a cumulative average of at least 1.5 as the minimum standard of scholarship and must not fall more than 6 credits behind the total number of credits a student of their status is expected to have completed (15 credits each semester freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior year). Any student who is permitted by the dean to continue enrollment in a full-time undergraduate program is considered to be in good standing. Academic Dismissal At the end of each semester, students who do not meet the academic standards of the Carroll School of Management are dismissed. Possible grounds for academic dismissal include the following: Passing fewer than three courses (or 9 credits) in a semester Passing fewer than eight courses (or 24 credits) in an academic year (except senior year) Passing fewer than 18 courses (or 54 credits) by the end of sophomore year Passing fewer than 28 courses (or 84 credits) by the end of junior year A cumulative grade point average of below 1.5 Students with any combination of 7 withdrawals and/or failures may be permanently dismissed A student on probation may return to good standing by approved methods (e.g., make-up of credits via approved summer school work; students may make up no more than 12 credits in summer study). A student who incurs additional failures or withdrawals or carries an unapproved underload while on probation may be required to withdraw from the School at the time of the next review. Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences Major Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences Major Students who have a very strong interest in an area in Arts and Sciences may complete a major in the Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences by careful use of their electives. For example, it is possible to graduate with a concentration in Finance and a major in Philosophy or History. Students interested in this option should contact the Carroll School of Management Undergraduate Senior Associate Dean and the department chairperson in the Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences as early in their studies as possible. Pre-Medical Studies Carroll School students are also eligible to pursue a pre-medical course of study in addition to their management curriculum. International Study International Study Studying and living in another country enables students to broaden their horizons and experience a different culture, and Carroll School of Management students who have a 3.0 GPA or higher are eligible to study abroad during their junior year. During the spring semester of freshman year, the Dean’s Office sponsors an annual program for management students interested in studying abroad; a subsequent fall semester program for first semester sophomores complements the first-year program. All students interested in international study should visit the Office of Global Education early in their sophomore year. The Office of Global Education administers a growing number of programs for Boston College including course-based summer programs for those who desire a shorter abroad experience or cannot go during the regular academic year. Carroll School of Management students may avail themselves of opportunities for study in excellent institutions in the Pacific Rim, continental Europe and the United Kingdom, South America, and Eastern Europe, among others. See elsewhere in this Catalog for a full listing. Special Programs Special Programs Pre-Professional Studies for Law Pre-Law students need clear reasoning power, a facility for accurate expression, a mature balance of judgment, and the ability to appreciate the moral, social, and economic problems related to the administration of justice in modern society. The Carroll School of Management offers an ideal opportunity to develop these qualities both through the Liberal Arts Core and specialized management courses, notably those case style courses which place a premium on analytical powers and a capacity in both oral and written expression. Carroll School students interested in law should contact Salvatore Cipriano, Assistant Director for Career Engagement, in the Career Center, and the University's pre-law advisor. The Ethics Initiative In addition to Portico (PRTO1000), many regular Carroll School of Management courses integrate ethical issues in business and management. Elective courses in accounting, marketing, law, and operations are focused on ethical issues specific to those disciplines. The Winston Center for Leadership and Ethics offers annual lecture, seminar, and workshop programs on ethics and leadership for undergraduate students.

Carroll School of Management Dean's Office Courses Carroll School of Management Dean's Office Courses PRTO1000 Portico (Fall: 3) This course is required for all Carroll School students and must be taken in the fall semester of their first year at BC. Portico fulfills the Carroll School ethics requirement. This is the introductory course for Carroll School of Management’s first year students. Topics will include ethics, leadership, globalization, economic development, capitalism, innovation, entrepreneurship, vocational discernment, and the types and structures of organizations operating in the business world. This will be an interactive 3-credit seminar, serving as one of the five courses in the fall semester and fulfilling the ethics requirement for the Carroll School. The instructor will serve as academic advisor during the student’s first year. The Department BCOM6688 Business Writing and Communication Skills for Managers (Fall/Spring: 3) Restricted to CSOM The course focuses on the type of communication done on the job, especially in corporations. Business assignments are used to illustrate appropriate writing and communication strategies, protocols, practices, styles, and formats. Students work alone and in collaboration with others around a variety of assignments and tools including everyday business communications, reports, proposals, and presentations. By the end of the semester, students will be proficient in producing business materials for a variety of audiences including clients, colleagues, managers, and executives. Rita Owens PRTO2401 Free Markets, Faith, and the Common Good (Spring: 3) If sharing our gifts, pursuing justice, and acting on our concern for the poor and marginalized of society are core values of Jesuit-trained students, to what extent is free market capitalism a good "fit" for helping us meet those goals? In this course, we will explore several key moral and philosophical foundations of free market capitalism. These arguments will then be placed in dialogue with central insights contained in Catholic social teaching, especially the principles of human dignity, solidarity, the preferential option for the poor, and the common good. Joseph Cioni PRTO4307 Happiness in a Commercial Society (Spring: 3) The aim of this course is to introduce students to the interdisciplinary study of human well-being with a special emphasis on how that pursuit is influenced by contemporary capitalism and commercial life in general. The course will include philosophical, psychological, and social scientific inquiries into human flourishing as they apply to topics such as the relationship between wealth and happiness, the nature of meaningful work, the changing structure of relational networks, as well as practical strategies for emotional regulation and increased self-knowledge. Michael Smith Jeremy Evans PRTO4901 Special Topics: The Ethics of Capitalism (Spring: 3) This course explores the philosophical basis and moral implications of contemporary commercial life. Along the way, we will consider the role of business in society, the relationship between capitalism and democracy, and the ethics of consumption, among other issues where market values intersect public and private virtues. Michael Smith Jeremy Evans UGMG1010 Perspectives on Management (Spring: 3) This course, taught by practitioners John Clavin (BC '84) and Jere Doyle (BC '87), provides BC students with an excellent opportunity to explore the functional disciplines of business from a real-world perspective. Using a combination of lectures, case studies, readings, and outside speakers, the course provides students the opportunity to get grounded in each of the CSOM concentrations while gaining outside views on careers in related fields and industries. The course will also provide a framework to explore and discuss cross-functional issues that impact business strategy and execution. This is a highly interactive class that places a premium on both preparation and participation each week. The course is initially open to CSOM sophomores but normally has availability for juniors and seniors across all undergraduate majors John Clavin Jeremiah Doyle UGMG2222 Career Accelerator (Fall/Spring:1) Restricted to sophomores and second semester freshmen in the Carroll School of Management It is a 1-credit pass/fail course consisting of nine 75-minute sessions designed to ensure that you learn the following: how to identify your top skills/interests and explore career fields that are a good match; how to write an effective resume/cover letter; how to talk about yourself to employers; how to network effectively and utilize the BC Network; how to interview to get the job; how to dress to impress; how to make a positive first impression; how to use social media to your advantage. This course utilizes a group of about 300 alumni called Eagle Experts who you will utilize for learning to network and for conducting a mock interview. You will also hear from a panel of recruiters to help you better understand the ins and outs of campus recruitment.
