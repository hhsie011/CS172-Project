Yiddish at Columbia Home Academic Yiddish Early/Old Yiddish Ritual Yiddish Theatre Yiddish Press Language and Culture Atlas of Ashkenazic Jewry Columbia University was one of the first institutions in the United States with a Yiddish program, and its Language and Culture Atlas of Ashkenazic Jewry is still a critical resource in the study of the many variants of the Yiddish Language. In honor of the digitization of the LCAAJ fieldnotes, Columbia University Libraries mounted an exhibition highlighting Yiddish at Columbia - both the vibrant academic research of Yiddish language and literature, as well as the deep and extensive Yiddish collections in its library. Many thanks to Sandra Chiritescu, Bob Scott, Jenny Lee, Andrew Sunshine, Ulrike Kiefer, Robert Neumann, Jocelyn Wilk, Violeta Ilik, Melanie Wacker, and Christopher B. Antkowiak for their assistance in putting this exhibition together. Exhibit Curator Michelle Chesner Norman E.
