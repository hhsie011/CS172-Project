Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute programs advance neuroscience research through interdisciplinary research grants. Through everything we do, we are bringing together brilliant people from diverse disciplines to tackle the unanswered questions in neuroscience. Big Ideas in Neuroscience We ask our faculty to come together and dream big. Big Ideas in Neuroscience grants pave the way for larger teams of researchers to tackle fundamental problems in neuroscience. After our first round of Big Ideas, three outstanding teams are receiving 5 years of funding to tackle addiction, brain rejuvenation and interfacing with the brain. Our second round of Big Ideas funded groups advancing new research platforms to connect molecular to systems-level neuroscience and advance the study of human brain circuits at a molecular and cellular level. Learn more Seed Grants Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute awards seed grants to fund innovative, interdisciplinary research projects in the neurosciences. We seek focused, intense collaborations between 2-3 faculty members piloting a novel idea. Learn More Neuroscience:Translate The translational grant program has been established to support translational neuroscience research projects at the intersection of science, engineering and medicine. The goal of the program is to encourage research that addresses unmet needs and leads to improvements in brain health or neurosciences, and to create commercial products. Learn more Research Accelerator Projects Research accelerator projects are driven by interdisciplinary teams of faculty making advancements in specific areas of neuroscience research. Learn More EPFL-Stanford Exchange Program Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and Stanford University seek applicants for short-term international research exchanges funded by Firmenich. Learn more Visiting Scholar Awards Recognizing that scholars visiting on sabbatical are a key opportunity for collaboration, the Institute offers a Visiting Scholar Award.
