We envision collaborative community environments that engage civility and embrace diversity. OSU’s Office of Institutional Diversity collaborates with university partners to advance inclusive excellence throughout all facets of Oregon State University. Our Extension and Engagement Diversity, Equity and Inclusion unit provides resources to support the development of safe, welcoming and relevant Extension programs and services that meet the needs of all Oregon communities. OSU Extension's Commitments and Actions The OSU Extension Service is committed to equal access and opportunity, and to ensuring all reasonable effort is made to deliver and to provide access to Extension programs and services for all individuals. OSU employees participate in professional development opportunities, such as OSU’s Search Advocate Program, Social Justice Education Initiative workshops or OSU Extension's Diversity Champions program. These activities generate conversations and reflection around the complex issues of equity and inclusion. This work aligns with the university's mission and values, the OSU strategic plan and our highest aspirations for social justice within the university community. As a land grant institution, we have the power to impact every single person that we come in contact with. To realize this vision, we must gather and invest in resources that ensure inclusive action at all levels and ensure that people from all walks of life have the opportunity to transform the world through their unique talents, ideas and voices. Our goal is to ensure that these voices are not just heard but embraced. Was this page helpful?
