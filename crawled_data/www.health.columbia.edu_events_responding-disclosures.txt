The goal of this virtual workshop is to begin preparing all students to intervene in situations of potential or active sexual violence and to discuss how to respond when a peer or loved one discloses harm that occurred to them. In light of our current climate, where there has been a stark uptick in reports of intimate partner violence and abuse, we will also explore how to respond in a helpful and supportive way to disclosures of harm. The session will be facilitated by Columbia Health Sexual Violence Response (SVR) staff members, Joli Ienuso, M.Ed., Prevention Coordinator at Columbia Health Sexual Violence Response, and Charlene Bernasko, M.A., Ed.M., Violence Prevention Educator, Columbia Health Sexual Violence Response Register here: https://columbiacuimc.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_hfisngb-RbuYtBcCLMYEww Contact Information Columbia Health Sexual Violence Response 212-854-HELP (4357) [email protected] Upcoming Events Columbia Health Administration Wallach Hall, Suite 125, Mail Code 4202, 1116 Amsterdam Avenue · New York, NY 10027 Phone 212-854-2284 Contact Us [email protected] Internal Use Only Login to Access Follow Us Facebook Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
