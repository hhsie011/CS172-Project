Federal regulations require the University to establish, publish and apply standards to monitor your progress toward completion of your certificate or degree program. If you fail to meet these standards, you will be placed on financial aid warning or suspension. Your academic performance must meet the SAP standards below. These standards include “qualitative” as well as “quantitative” components. Students must maintain a certain cumulative grade point average (qualitative) and successfully earn minimal numbers of degree credits at each evaluation (quantitative). In determining satisfactory academic progress, all course work is considered, whether or not the student received financial aid at the time the work was completed. Academic progress is reviewed each term after grades are posted. Students, who do not meet the standards of satisfactory academic progress, are notified by the Dean of Students via email. Satisfactory Academic Progress General Regulations GSAPP QUALITATIVE STANDARD Represented by your grade point average (number of LP’s). Consistent with the GSAPP’s academic standing policy; you must be in good academic standing to remain eligible for aid. Consistent with the general academic requirements of the Graduate School, graduate students must maintain a cumulative grade point average as per below: Graduate Degree Academic Requirement M.ARCH No more than 2 LPs in any distribution M.S. AAD / M.S. AUD No more than 2 LPs in the Design Sequence or 3 in the program M.S. CCCP No more than 4 LPs in the entire program M.S. HP / M.S. UP No more than 4 LPs in the entire program M.S. RED / M.S. CDP No more than 3 LPs in the entire program DUAL M. ARCH & M.S. UP No more than 2 LPs in any distribution DUAL M.S. UP + M.S. SW (Master of Science in Social Work) No more than 6 LPs in the entire program DUAL M.S. UP + M.S. HP No more than 6 LPs in the entire program DUAL M.S. UP + JD (Juris Doctor) No more than 6 LPs in the entire program DUAL M.S. UP + MBA (Master of Business Administration) No more than 6 LPs in the entire program DUAL MSUP + M.S. IA (Master of Science in International Affairs) No more than 6 LPs in the entire program DUAL M.S. UP + M.S. PH (Master of Science in Public Health) No more than 6 LPs in the entire program NY/Paris (The Shape of Two Cities: New York / Paris Program) No more than 3 LPs in the entire program GSAPP QUANTITATIVE STANDARD This standard has two parts. PART ONE First, you must successfully complete a required percentage (67%) of the credits you attempt. This component is referred to as your credit completion ratio. The quantitative component measures the pace at which the student must progress through his/her program of study to ensure completion within the maximum timeframe allowed. Pace is calculated by dividing the cumulative number of credit hours the student successfully completed by the number of cumulative credit hours the student has attempted. The completion ratio must be 67% or greater. For example, a student attempted 12 credit hours in the fall semester and earned 8 credits and in the spring semester s/he attempted 14 credits and earned 11. 8 credits + 11 credits = 19 credits earned. 12 credits + 14 credits =26 credits attempted. 19/26 = 73% which is greater than the completion ratio of 67%. PART TWO Second, you must complete your degree or certificate program within a maximum timeframe (150%), which may vary according to your student status and program. The maximum timeframe a student may attend and continue financial aid eligibility cannot exceed 150% of the published length of the student’s academic program measured in academic years. The length of a graduate program is based on the published length for each individual program; in no case will the graduate student’s enrollment exceed the 150% point in time. When the student’s enrollment exceeds the 150% point, the student is no longer eligible for financial aid. In summary: Graduate Degree Cumulative GPA/ Academic Requirement Cumulative Completion Ratio Required Minimum Required Credits Minimum Duration of Program Maximum Timeframe for Completion M.ARCH No more than 2 LPs in any distribution 67% 108 points 6 semesters full-time enrollment 150% = 162 points M.S. AAD & M.S. AUD No more than 2 LPs in the Design Sequence or 3 in the program 67% 45 points 3 semesters full-time enrollment 150% = 67.5 points M.S. CCCP No more than 4 LPs in the entire program 67% 48 points 4 semesters full-time enrollment 50% = 72 points M.S. HP & M.S. UP No more than 4 LPs in the entire program 67% 60 points 4 semesters full-time enrollment 150% = 90 points M.S. RED / M.S. CDP No more than 3 LPs in the entire program 67% 45 points 3 semesters full-time enrollment 150% = 67.5 points DUAL M.ARCH + M.S. UP No more than 2 LPs in any distribution 67% 144 points 8 semesters full-time enrollment DUAL M.S. UP + M.S. SW (Master of Science in Social Work) No more than 6 LPs in the entire program 67% 90 points 6 semesters total (3 @ GSAPP) 150% = 135 points DUAL M.S. UP + M.S. HP No more than 6 LPs in the entire program 67% 96 points 6 semesters full-time enrollment 150% = 144 points DUAL M.S. UP + JD (Juris Doctor) No more than 6 LPs in the entire program 67% 119 points 8 semesters total (2 semesters @ GSAPP) 150% = 178.5 points DUAL M.S. UP + MBA (Master of Business Administration) No more than 6 LPs in the entire program 67% 90 points 6 semesters total (3 semesters @ GSAPP) 150% = 135 points DUAL M.S. UP + M.S. IA (Master of Science in International Affairs) No more than 6 LPs in the entire program 67% 90 points 6 semesters total (3 semesters @ GSAPP) 150% = 135 points DUAL M.S. UP + M.S. PH (Master of Science in Public Health) No more than 6 LPs in the entire program 67% 84 points 5 semesters total (3 semesters @ GSAPP) 150% = 126 points NY/Paris (The Shape of Two Cities: New York / Paris Program) No more than 3 LPs in the entire program 67% 24 points 2 semesters full-time enrollment 150% = 36 points GSAPP SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROCESS APPEAL PROCESS A student notified of their failure to meet Satisfactory Academic Progress is no longer eligible for federal or institutional financial aid. The student may appeal for additional eligibility by completing a SAP appeal letter. As part of the appeal the student must explain: Why they failed to make academic progress, and What has changed that will allow the student to make SAP during the upcoming academic year. All appeals are submitted to the Office of Financial Aid. If an appeal is granted the student will be placed on a status of Financial Aid Probation and given an academic plan they must adhere to. The Probation status will last for one term. At the end of that term the student will again be evaluated to determine whether: The student is now making SAP; or The student is making progress under the specified academic plan. If the student fails to meet the criteria established as part of the appeal, they will be placed on a financial aid suspension status and will be ineligible for financial aid until s/he meets the minimum Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements or submits a second successful appeal.
