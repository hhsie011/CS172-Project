Using the Honors Center The Honors Center is a shared space that is available to all Clemson Honors students and for events and programs associated with the Honors College.

Honors Center Guidelines All Honors spaces are to be used for events and programs associated with the Honors College. Honors college staff and faculty have priority for use of the rooms.

Honors classes have priority scheduling for the Great Hall and the Classrooms/Seminar rooms, but they can also be used for group meetings and studying. Honors College staff also use these spaces. The work room and kitchen are open to you 24 hours a day, but CLEANING UP after yourself is required. If the kitchen has been reserved for an event, this will be posted. Code of Conduct Every student is expected to comply with Clemson University rules and state and local laws regarding alcohol and tobacco use. Keep all areas clean and safe. CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF/YOUR EVENT - leave no trash, leave no messes. You are responsible for the behavior of yourself and your guests! Do not remove furniture from the room it is in. Failure to comply with general rules of the Honors Center may result in loss or suspension of use and/or referral to the university conduct office. Report any issues to Jenny Wirtz.
