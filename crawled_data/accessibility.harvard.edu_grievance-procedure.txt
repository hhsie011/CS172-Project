This resolve is grounded not only in the law, including Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act but also in Harvard's own commitment to the inclusion of all members of the community. The Harvard University Student Disability Grievance Policy and Procedure is intended to provide for the prompt and equitable resolution of complaints involving discrimination on the basis of disability. STAFF Discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, creed, national origin, age, ancestry, veteran status, disability unrelated to job requirements, genetic information, military service, or any other legally protected basis is unlawful and intolerable to the University. Any employee who feels that he/she is a victim of discrimination is encouraged to seek assistance through the internal problem solving or the formal complaint processes. More information on the Staff Discrimination Policy and Review Procedure is available on the HR website.
