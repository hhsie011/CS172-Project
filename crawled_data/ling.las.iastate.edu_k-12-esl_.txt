The growing number of English language learners (ELLs) nationwide makes the ESL endorsement a useful addition to an endorsement in elementary education, or middle and high school content areas (e.g., English, Spanish, science). This program is also useful for students who wish to teach English abroad in programs such as the Peace Corps. At Iowa State University, ESL is an add-on endorsement, which means that students need to be certified in another area and to take all basic teacher preparation courses. Courses, in accordance with state requirements and the professional standards of TESOL, are designed to give students a framework in linguistics applied to second language education with appropriate methods and practice teaching. For further information, contact Taylor Anne Barriuso, ESL Endorsement Coordinator. Requirements for an ESL endorsement The Departments of English and Curriculum & Instruction offer courses leading to a K-12 ESL endorsement. To add the endorsement, students must earn credits in the following courses.
