UT Austin’s Family Weekend has had many names through the years, like “Dad’s Day” and “Parents Weekend,” but regardless of what it has been called, this annual campus tradition has brought generations of Longhorn Families to the Forty Acres to visit their students and to celebrate Living the Longhorn Life®. We look forward to celebrating UT with you and your family in 2023!
