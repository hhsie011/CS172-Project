Flowcharts Reporting and Assessment Flowchart Faculty Process Flowchart Staff Process Flowchart Student Process Flowchart Informal Resolution Process - Quick Reference Guide Supportive Measures - Quick Reference Guide Title IX Exception to the Community Expectations Agreement To remove barriers to reporting and responding to sexual misconduct during the global coronavirus pandemic, Dartmouth has adopted an exception related to certain violations of the Community Expectations Agreement (CEA). In situations involving Title IX complaints where violations of the Community Expectations Agreement and/or other College health and safety requirements also occurred, Dartmouth will not pursue violations of the CEA for students reporting or responding to Title IX allegations. If Title IX reporting or responding students host or attend unauthorized gatherings in violation of health and safety policies, the CEA violation may still need to be addressed to mitigate health risks to the community. However, addressing that violation would not necessarily result in the loss of opportunity to engage in the educational program as a residential student and may instead include options such as policy reminders, connection to campus resources, prohibiting access to specific areas of campus, or other restorative practices. It is the responsibility of the student to be aware of the parameters and expectations of the CEA, as they may change based on the circumstances created by the pandemic. Dartmouth retains the ability to exercise discretion and may not apply this exception in cases of egregious violation of the CEA.
