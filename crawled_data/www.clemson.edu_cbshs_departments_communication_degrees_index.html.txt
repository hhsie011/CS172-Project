Core classes include communication theory and research methods, and students can also choose from additional classes in areas such as public relations and popular culture, as well as health, political and sports communication. The curriculum is forward-thinking and prepares students to compete for careers in the communication profession or to continue their education in graduate school.

This diverse skill set enables students to meet the challenges of the rapidly evolving communication profession.

Their communication expertise applies to fields such as communication, public health/health organizations, marketing research, media studies, politics, community organizing, sports, entertainment and marketing. Our nationally known faculty members have expertise in diverse areas of human communication, and the scholarship they pursue challenges and educates students at both abstract and applied levels. Our teacher-scholars conduct cutting-edge research in areas such as health and sports communication, new communication technologies and social media, organizational communication, as well as media and culture. Coursework and interaction with faculty members instill in students broadmindedness, ethical sensibilities, rigorous thought processes and genuine curiosity about the social world. Bachelor of Arts In Communication Whether you hope to manage a business, produce documentaries, coordinate public relations and publicity for a major corporation, promote a nonprofit or tell stories as a news reporter, the secret to success is effective communication.
