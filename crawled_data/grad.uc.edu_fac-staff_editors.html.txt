Award Award Winners Editorial Assistance Awards The Graduate School will not offer an Editorial Assistance Awards competition for the 2021-2022 academic year. The Editorial Assistance Awards provide support to faculty who choose to take on journal editing responsibilities. If selected for an award, the editor will receive support to hire a graduate student (as a GA or student worker) to serve as an editorial assistant. The Graduate School offers two levels of support for this award: Support for a graduate assistantship position. Each student receiving an assistantship will be awarded a Graduate Assistant Scholarship (GAS) and stipend ($18,500 if a PhD student, $14,500 if master’s or non-PhD doctoral student) to be used towards a 10-month academic appointment. The student appointed by the faculty member to the GA position must be a full-time graduate student eligible for a graduate assistantship. Support for a graduate student worker. Faculty will be given funds to pay $15/hour for 4 to 10 hours per week to hire one or more graduate students to provide editorial assistance. The graduate student worker(s) must be hourly-paid, matriculated part- or full-time graduate student(s) in good standing at UC. The student(s) may have additional awards or assistantships, but their combined hourly work cannot exceed 24 hours per week* when classes are in session (40hr/week when not in session). The funds are awarded for 12 months and are available as early as July 1, i.e., the start of the fiscal year. *International students are limited to working 20 hours per week while school is in session and are limited to 40 hours per week during schedule breaks. Faculty who apply for, but do not receive, funds for a graduate assistantship position will automatically be considered for funding for a graduate student worker. Editorial Assistance Awards may be renewed only if selected by the committee through the formal application process each year. Generally, there is a three-year limit on receiving an editorial assistantship for a journal not permanently housed at the University of Cincinnati. Upcoming Award Cycle The selection committee will review applications and make selections based on the total application package. A completed application package consists of one (1) PDF document, submitted via email, cloud storage shared folder or flash drive, containing: Completed Application Form (DOCX), including supporting documentation such as the referee review form, the journal policies and procedures, and web link for journal. A letter clearly addressing each of the criteria listed on the Editorial Assistance Criteria (PDF). (To view this document, you will need Adobe Acrobat Reader, a free download.) A letter of support from the program director or department head, whoever is appropriate, on university letterhead. A physical copy of a recent representative issue of the journal if no web link available. Incomplete or late application packages will not be considered. Direct your questions and completed application package to: Megan Tischner, 513-556-2379, megan.tischner@uc.edu, ML 0627 or 110 Van Wormer Hall.
