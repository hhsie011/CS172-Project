PreviousNext Susanne Zantop The Zantop Memorial Lecture in Comparative Literature has been held in Susanne Zantop's honor since 2002. A Professor of German and Comparative Literature, Zantop was an active and adored member of the Dartmouth community for over 30 years until her murder in 2001. Zantop, a pioneer of the MA program in Comparative Literature at Dartmouth, enjoyed taking an active role in the development of student life on campus. Each year since her death, we have honored Professor Zantop's memory by inviting scholars who share her ideals: past speakers have included Carlos Fuentes (Brown), Amy Hollywood (Harvard) and Jonathan Culler (Cornell), all of whom have demonstrated, like Zantop, a strong investment in the lives of students. 2002-2020 Zantop Lectures 2022 Laura Wexler, Yale University, "Schooling the Punctum: What the Children Know" 2018-2019 Mary Louise Pratt, New York University, Thinking across the colonial divide: From Micaela Bastidas to Clorinda Matto de Turner, Perú 1750-1910 2017-2018 Geoffrey Bennington, Emory University, Derrida and the Non-Political Opening of Politics 2016-2017 Irene Kacandes, Dartmouth College, Seven Lessons I Learned from Studying the Holocaust and How They Can Help Us Cope with the Disgrace of Our Times. 2015-2016 Emily Apter, New York University, Not Translated, Non-Equivalent, Incommensurate: Rethinking the Laws of Translation 2014-2015 David Eng, University of Pennsylvania, Reparations and the Human 2013-2014 Peggy Kamuf, University of Southern California, Reading Phenomena 2012-2013 David Damrosch, Harvard University, Grand Theft Ovid: Literary Studies in the Internet Age 2011-2012 Lydia Liu, Columbia University, The Psychic Life of Digital Media 2010-2011 Doris Sommer, Harvard University, Welcome Back: The Humanities as Civic Education 2009-2010 No lecture this year 2008-2009 Marianne Hirsch, Columbia University and Leo Spitzer, Dartmouth College (Zantop Garden dedication), School Pictures and their Afterlives 2007-2008 Amy Hollywood, Harvard University, Don't Touch Me: the Various Roles of Mary Magdalen 2006-2007 Frances Hasso, Oberlin College, Economies of Desire: Governmentality in Egypt and the United Arab Emirates 2005-2006 Carlos Fuentes, Brown University, The Creative Spirit as a Force for Humanism 2004-2005 Judith Ryan, Harvard University, Shots in the Park: Post-Colonial Fantasies in Gerhard Hauptmann's The Shot in the Park and Marguerite Duras's The Vice-Consul 2003-2004 Andreas Huyssen, Columbia University, Modernist Miniatures: Literary Snapshots of Urban Spaces 2002-2003 Jonathan Culler, Cornell University, Omniscient Narration 2001-2002 Diana Taylor, New York University, Lost in the Field of Vision: Reflections on Witnessing 911 Departments African and African American Studies Anthropology Art History Asian Societies, Cultures, and Languages Program Biological Sciences Chemistry Classics Cognitive Science Comparative Literature Computer Science Earth Sciences Economics Education Engineering Sciences English Environmental Studies Film and Media Studies French and Italian Geography German Studies Government History Humanities 1 & 2 Institute for Writing and Rhetoric Jewish Studies Latin American, Latino and Caribbean Studies Linguistics Mathematics Medieval and Renaissance Studies Music Native American Studies Philosophy Physics and Astronomy Psychological and Brain Sciences Religion Russian Sociology Spanish and Portuguese Studio Art Theater Women’s and Gender Studies Inclusivity “Dartmouth’s capacity to advance its dual mission of education and research depends upon the full diversity and inclusivity of this community…Diversity and inclusivity are necessary partners. Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Comparative Literature Program Undergraduate About the Program Courses Courses Recommended For First Year Students Course Descriptions Major How to Apply Minor in Translation Studies Honors Thesis Program Thesis Timeline Past Theses Awards & Prizes Undergraduate Alumni Undergraduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Graduate Overview About the Program Current MA Students How to Apply Degree Requirements Courses Graduate Alumni Graduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Academic Achievement Award COLT MA Graduate Handbook News & Events Overview Annual Hoffman Lecture Annual Zantop Memorial Lecture People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
