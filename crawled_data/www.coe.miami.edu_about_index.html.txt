We have prepared leaders with the scientific and technical skills, ethical and moral grounding, to drive positive change in industry, government, health care, academia, and allied sectors. From modest beginnings—our first graduating class was a single student—we have grown into a five-department (now expanding to six-departments) College with a presence on all three (Coral Gables, Virginia Key, Downtown Miami) University campuses and degree programs at the undergraduate, master’s, and doctoral levels. In 2020 we graduated about 300 students, 33% of whom were female—a notable achievement in a discipline where women have historically been significantly underrepresented. As we approach our 75th year (in 2022) celebrations, we are moving forward with a boldly ambitious plan for our future that holds the promise of significant impact in the region, nation, globe—and with an outreach to space. Programs in advanced materials, aerosol science and technology, biomedical engineering, energy and environment, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, space sciences and engineering, sustainable construction, innovative educational programs among others, give us a strong platform for excelling in 21st-century discovery and problem-solving. We hope to accomplish this with high impact by collaborating with researchers and educators across the University - in the Arts & Sciences, Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, Business, Medicine, Nursing, Architecture, Law, Communication, and other disciplines, to extend and deepen our understanding of these global challenges and holistically impart the skills needed to solve them. Through the confluence of industry partnership, specialized research, and a thriving South Florida entrepreneurial ecosystem, the CoE is well positioned to drive innovation in South Florida and in the hemisphere, collaborate with industry to solve real-world problems in South Florida and around the world, and to educate the next generation of engineers to solve existing and as-yet-unimagined problems. We will achieve our goals through support from like-minded, ambitious individuals, our alumni, foundations, and industry partners who support our students, faculty and research as we embrace the challenge and promise of “Engineering Miami for the Future” – a future we have only begun to imagine. The COE has been led by visionary Deans – Einspruch, Becker, Temares, Tien, Bardet and Berg in the recent past 50 years. The current Dean, Dr. Pratim Biswas, member of the NAE, has taken charge to continue advancing the College forward to the next level of excellence.
