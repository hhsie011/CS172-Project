Eligibility requirements and amounts awarded vary. Here, you’ll find the information you need to understand the different types of scholarships offered, including university scholarships, school and college scholarships, and need-based and merit-based awards. First-Year Students Types of Scholarships Merit-based Scholarships All first-year students who complete their application by February 1 are automatically considered for merit scholarships. A separate application is not required. Merit scholarships range from $1,000 to full tuition. Eligibility can include a student’s academic, artistic or athletic accomplishments. In most cases, a student’s financial need will not determine a student's eligibility for a merit scholarship. Students are notified of merit scholarships in winter/early spring, depending on when they apply. Most merit scholarships at Temple require a minimum GPA to be maintained as a full-time student. Merit scholarships offered by the university include the President’s Scholar Award, which is a merit-based scholarship that awards full tuition to selected students. All first-year applicants are automatically considered for this scholarship. Recipients may also apply for one summer educational stipend of $4,000 to be used for a variety of academic experiences, including study away and internships. Explore more scholarship opportunities. Need-based Scholarships Eligibility for need-based scholarships is determined by a review of a student’s and/or family’s finances. Submitting your FAFSA by February 1 helps us determine your financial need for the upcoming year, and it is the only action you need to take to be considered for need-based aid. Need-based scholarships offered by the university include the Broad Street Finish Line Scholarship, which supports first-generation college students and helps them stay on track financially to graduate in four years. It’s awarded annually in increments of $500 to $5,000, depending on need. Coca-Cola First Generation Scholarship Program, which awards $5,000 annually to five first-year students who are the first in their immediate family to attend college and who demonstrate financial need. The scholarship is renewable for up to four years as long as the recipient maintains a 3.00 GPA. Explore more scholarship opportunities. Transfer Students New transfer students (U.S. citizens and permanent residents only) with a cumulative GPA of 3.3 or higher are considered for academic scholarships ranging from $1,000 to $5,000, based on a review of previous college work during the application process. No separate application is required. The table below represents the total scholarship amount transfer students are eligible for based on their cumulative GPA.
