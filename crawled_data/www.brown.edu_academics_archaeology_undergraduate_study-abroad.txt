Study abroad not only allows undergraduates the chance to work with new faculty and fellow students, but also to explore history and archaeology “on site” in a very direct way. Various options are available of when, and for how long, to go abroad. Summer programs usually last three to six weeks, programs in the academic year for either a semester or a full year. Interested students are encouraged to make contact with the undergraduate advisor as soon as possible to begin the planning process. Students should also consult with Brown’s Office of International Programs. Students have a choice of over 50 Brown-sponsored programs on four continents, including opportunities in Egypt, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The University also offers a large number of Alternative Programs, attended on a regular basis by Brown students, with approved credit transfer to Brown. For financial support to undertake study abroad, consult with the Office of International Programs and the Dean of the College Programs For general information about study abroad programs: StudyAbroad.com Brown's OIP "Find a Program" page Some well-known study abroad programs for those interested in archaeology of the Mediterranean, Egypt and Ancient Western Asia include: Egypt: American University of Cairo Greece: Arcadia University, Center for Hellenic, Balkan and Mediterranean Studies College Year in Athens: International Center for Hellenic and Mediterranean Studies Italy: Duke University: Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies Holy Cross University: American Institute for Roman Culture Turkey: CIEE: Middle East Technical University Transfer Credit for Study Abroad In certain cases, it may be possible for undergraduate students to receive transfer credit for courses taken at other universities, in the United States and abroad.
