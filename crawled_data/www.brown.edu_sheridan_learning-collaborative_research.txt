However, 1:1 mentored research opportunities are, by nature, limited by faculty availability and/or financial resources. One approach to increasing student access to research is through course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs), which can accommodate more participants and mitigate barriers associated with traditional research mentorship models (Bangera, Brownell, & Hatfull, 2014). A CURE course is defined by five characteristics: use of disciplinary practices, the discovery of an unknown outcome, broad relevance, collaboration, and iteration (Auchincloss et al., 2014; Ballen et al., 2017). For more details on these elements of a CURE, and the benefits for student learning and faculty teaching, please see this Sheridan resource. In collaboration with Brown's HHMI initiative, the Sheridan Center for Teaching and Learning is engaged in a number of initiatives to enhance Brown University students’ capacities for doing research. These initiatives are part of the Brown Learning Collaborative and include a CURE Faculty Institute and an undergraduate course “The Theory and Practice of Problem Solving and Research” (UNIV 1110), which focuses on helping Undergraduate TAs be effective peer teachers in STEM CUREs. The students in UNIV 1110 engage in a research project the second half of the term to gain a better understanding of what students in a CURE experience and reflect on their own learning, in order to become highly effective problem solvers and researchers themselves. COEX Curricular Designation Collaborative Research and Scholarly Experiences (COEX)-designated courses engage groups of students in addressing a research question or knowledge gap of interest to scholarly communities. These courses make research and scholarly experiences more inclusive and accessible to students, and they are designed to complement the traditional model of 1:1 faculty-student mentorships or independent studies. CURE Faculty Institute The CURE Faculty Institute offered faculty evidence-based practices for creating course-based research experiences that focus on student inquiry and promote student learning. Faculty applied to receive up to $32,000 to develop a course, or module within a course, that focuses on research. Support for course development included professional training on course design based on emergent practices within the CURE model, individual consultation and feedback, a supportive cohort of peers, easily adaptable course materials, and standardized course assessment. Participants were encouraged to co-design their course with a fellow faculty member, postdoc, graduate student, and/or undergraduate teaching assistant(s). Participants also had the option of creating a community-engaged CURE, working in collaboration with the Swearer Center.
