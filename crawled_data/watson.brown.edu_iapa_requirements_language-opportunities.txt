Language study, though not required, is strongly encouraged and rewarded in the International and Public Affairs concentration. Learn more about language placement exams. Students may substitute one of the concentration’s two required research methods -- either the qualitative or quantitative research methods course -- with successful completion of a Brown or Brown-approved language course at the 0400 level or above. Bilingual courses do not count. The upper-level language course must be taken for a grade. Funding for Language Study As part of our effort to encourage language study for Watson Institute concentrators, the Watson Institute provides financial support for off-campus language learning, with priority given to immersive language programs, and with special consideration given to the study of languages not formally offered at Brown. This funding is offered on a competitive basis, with one application period in the fall term, and a second application period in the spring term.
