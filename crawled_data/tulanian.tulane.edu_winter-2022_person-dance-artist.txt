Dancers perform ‘Say it Once Not Twice’ (above) in a new work created by Ziv, who will be a guest artist for spring 2022. She’ll choreograph an original piece for the Newcomb Dance Program concert. For the first time since the beginning of the pandemic, the Department of Theatre and Dance, Newcomb Dance Program is welcoming a guest artist to be in residence. Although some great guests have Zoomed in during the past two years, the program is excited that Ronit Ziv — one of Israel’s most active choreographers — will be on campus, in person in spring 2022. With over 20-plus original works to her credit, Ziv has been dancing and evolving her choreography since the late 1990s. Well known for prizewinning works and her appearances with dance companies throughout Europe, the Middle East and the United States, including the Batsheva Ensemble, CNDC l’esquisse and Campania Instavel, Ziv performs and teaches the Release Technique in contemporary dance. She is an in-demand performer and teacher who has mastered the Release Technique’s difficult constellation of movements, breathing and muscle practices. She holds an MA in Research of the Performing Arts and is a current PhD candidate at Tel Aviv University. Ziv attracted the eye of Tulane faculty with her interesting work and kind and open nature. With such achievements and credits to her name, the department feels lucky to have Ziv’s presence for the spring semester. Ziv will be teaching contemporary technique classes for both advanced and mid-level students and creating an original contemporary dance piece that will be performed at the end of the semester as the Department of Theatre and Dance, Newcomb Dance Program annual spring dance concert. This performance, from April 26 to May 1, will be open to the public.
