In past years, the Center has held several public events featuring scientists, faculty members and researchers from the Earth Institute’s Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO). In addition to these programs, many Columbia scientists continue collaborating with Chilean counterparts in research projects in this field. Columbia University faculty and their Chilean counterparts are increasingly interested in collaborative research projects and initiatives; however, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the vast majority of this work has moved online. Such is the case for the three latest projects that were awarded financing from the President’s Global Innovation Fund (PGIF): addressing research gaps on sexual minority health in Chile, led by the Associate Dean for Global Health at Columbia’s School of Nursing, Tonda Hughes; the massive entry of renewable energy in Chile, directed by Dylan Possamaï, Assistant Professor of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research; and the Chilean next generation of seasonal climate forecasts, led by Angel Muñoz, Associate Research Scientist at the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI).
