The National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit professional degree programs in architecture offered by institutions with U.S. regional accreditation, recognizes three types of degrees: the Bachelor of Architecture, the Master of Architecture, and the Doctor of Architecture. A program may be granted an eight-year term, an eight-year term with conditions, or a two-year term of continuing accreditation, or a three-year term of initial accreditation, depending on the extent of its conformance with established education standards. Doctor of Architecture and Master of Architecture degree programs may require a non-accredited undergraduate degree in architecture for admission. However, the non-accredited degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree.” The Oklahoma State University School of Architecture offers the following NAAB-accredited degree programs: B. Arch. (154 undergraduate credits) Next accreditation visit: 2025, http://www.naab.org/. High School Preparation In addition to the curricular requirements for admission specified by OSU, the College of Engineering, Architecture and Technology strongly recommends that students have a fourth year of mathematics and an additional year of laboratory science. Initial placement in OSU mathematics courses is by placement examination to ensure that each student will be challenged but has the preparation to be successful in the first mathematics course. Placement in science courses is based on prior preparation in the science and completion of or placement beyond prerequisite mathematics courses. When appropriate,a student with an exceptionally strong background can obtain academic credit by advanced standing examination or by College Level Examination Program (CLEP) tests or similar. Enrolling in the College of Engineering, Architecture, and Technology A freshman student who has been admitted to OSU can be enrolled directly into a CEAT degree program if the student has both of the following performance requirements: an ACT Composite score of 24 or higher, or a total SAT score of 1160 or higher, and an ACT MATH score of 24 or higher, or a SAT Math score of 600 or higher, OR achieve a GPA of 3.5 or higher (on a 4.00 grading scale standard weighting to The College Board’s Advanced Placement courses and the International Baccalaureate higher-level courses) in the required 15 core high school courses. SAT score is the combination of Critical Reading and Math sections only. SAT scores represent tests taken on or after the National March 2016 test. Due to COVID-19, admission to OSU is test optional for the fall 2021 entering classes. If a student is admitted to CEAT following the test optional admission guidelines, they can be enrolled directly into a CEAT degree program if the student has a minimum 3.5 (15-unit core) GPA. Prospective engineering, architecture or technology students who do not meet these performance qualifications may enroll in any other college or may enroll in University College in the Pre-CEAT program and work with a CEAT-focused advisor to gain the academic background for enrollment in CEAT degree programs. Those students will be enrolled in a CEAT degree program when they have met the following performance requirements: passed all prerequisite MATH courses needed to enroll in Calculus I or Calculus for Technology I, and has an OSU Cumulative GPA of at least 2.0. Transfer students can enroll directly into a CEAT degree program if they satisfy all OSU resident transfer student requirements, have a GPA of at least 2.0, and are qualified to enroll in Calculus I or higher in the MATH sequence. Other transfer students may enroll in University College in the Pre-CEAT program until they meet the qualifications for enrolling in a CEAT pre-professional program. Students transferring to CEAT from another major at OSU must meet the same requirements for admission as a student transferring from another college or university.
