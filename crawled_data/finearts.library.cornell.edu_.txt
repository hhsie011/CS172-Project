Housed in the library and at the Annex, our collection grows by approximately 4,000 titles each year and comprises more than 267,000 volumes and subscriptions to more than 850 periodical titles. In print and online, we provide discipline-focused resources to search for publications, including the Avery Index to Architectural Periodicals, Urban Studies Abstracts, and Art & Architecture Source. We license various image collections from Artstor, and provide access to thousands of Cornell’s digital images. In addition to our wide-ranging collections, our librarians help you in different ways—from recommending and finding print and digital sources for your research, to conducting instruction sessions for your classes.
