The requirements for Yale-sponsored events are available here. From our discreet 16-person video conferencing room to the 250-seat Grace Murray Hopper Auditorium, our facilities support faculty and students throughout the Yale community for departmental meetings, symposia, retreats, and conferences. The Conference Center accommodates numerous configurations – from classroom, boardroom or theater styles, to formal or buffet-style dining. The second floor at the Conference Center has been given a fresh look, with improved high-top desk space and amenities for touch-down working and quiet study. The flexible Study Lounge is open to eveyone on a first come, first served basis. Our lounges, games room and outside Terrace seating provide ample space for your event, with free parking for conference participants and guests.
