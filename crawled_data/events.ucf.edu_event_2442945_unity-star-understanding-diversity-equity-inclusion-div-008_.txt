Events at UCF Log In UNITY STAR: Understanding Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DIV 008) Edit Add Event To Wednesday, June 1, 2022 2:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. As the foundational workshop facilitated by UCF’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion, this workshop explores three key concepts – diversity, inclusion, and equity. Discussions and activities develop the following ideas: human diversity is broad and includes all the ways in which we differ, understanding our similarities is key to developing connections, inclusion involves creating and maintaining safe and respectful spaces for everyone, and equity requires us to respond to the needs of individuals in order for each person to realize their full potential. The impact of stereotypes (“single stories”) on our thinking and behavior also is explored.
