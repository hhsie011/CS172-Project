Faculty Senate represents all these faculty in furtherance of the mission of the university which is to promote student learning through excellence in teaching, research, and service. Faculty, by mandate of the Board of Trustees, "assist, advise, and counsel the Presidnet of the University and the Board" in matters including, but not limited to, “academic policies, admissions, degree programs, budgets, collegiate structures, and the formation and implementation of long-term plans.” A primary and central means to carry out this mandate is through the University Faculty Senate which includes over one hundred representatives from the multiple campuses on which faculty teach, conduct research, engage in scholarship, and provide service to the university. To carry out these goals, the Faculty Senate works cooperatively with the President, the Board of Trustees, and the Provost Office; the many integral units around campus that provide support for faculty, students, and staff; and the students themselves. Through this shared responsibiility of governance, and by embodying the precept that diversity is our strength, we seek to ensure that each of our students--now totaling over 46,000--reach their potential as thoughtful and informed citizens of the world. We seek to bolster these values with every commitment we undertake. 2021-22 Meeting Dates Faculty Senate generally meets the second Thursday of every month from 3:30 p.m. - 5:00 p.m. Exceptions are noted below.
