June 27, 2019 8:00 AM - 6:00 PM Getulio Vargas Foundation (Praia de Botafogo, 190, Rio de Janeiro - RJ) The Getulio Vargas Foundation’s schools of Law and Public and Business Administration (FGV-EBAPE and FGV DIREITO RIO) and Columbia Global Centers | Rio de Janeiro are proud to co-host the 6th Global Conference on Transparency Research, to be held on the 26th and 27th of June, 2019 at FGV’s Rio de Janeiro Campus, on Praia de Botafogo, Rio de Janeiro. The Global Conference on Transparency Research is the world’s premier conference on transparency and welcomes research on transparency from multidisciplinary and multi-methodological vantage points. The Conference theme is "Measuring Transparency: Impact, Compliance, and Implementation". How do transparency policies impact the quality of organizations and the experience of citizens? To what extent are governments, corporations, and other types of entities making efforts to implement transparency policies and comply with them? For better or for worse, policies need to be measured to be taken seriously in this datafied world. Yet questions remain as to whether we have valid and reliable ‘measures’ of transparency, much less whether measures can travel across different policy, political, or organizational contexts. Should we ‘metricize’ some aspects of transparency at all? This year’s Global Conference on Transparency Research calls on researchers to analyze existing measures of transparency, present their own measures, or use transparency data to evaluate the performance of organizations and the empowerment of key stakeholders in accessing and using transparent information. The conference embraces qualitative and quantitative examinations of all types of transparency, from open data to active and passive transparency, and a wide range of subjects, from business and finance, policy, politics, and law, to surveillance and artificial intelligence, and beyond.
