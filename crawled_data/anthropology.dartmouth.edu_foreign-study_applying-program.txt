Linguistics: Linguistics 1, “Introductory Linguistics,” and one other linguistics course in the 20s. In addition, applicants must have maintained at Dartmouth a 3.0 cumulative grade average and continue to do so from the time of application through the time of departure for New Zealand. Applicants must not be facing academic or conduct discipline at Dartmouth. Anyone whose cumulative GPA falls below 3.0 can be rejected from the program even after formal acceptance by Dartmouth. Further, acceptance into the program by Dartmouth College constitutes only a recommendation to the University of Auckland’s Foreign Student Admission Committee that the student be admitted to the University of Auckland as a special student specifically for this program. The University of Auckland makes the final decision on the Dartmouth student’s acceptance. Enrollment limited to 22 students. Application Procedure The next foreign study program (FSP) at the University of Auckland, New Zealand will be in winter 2022. Applicants must apply online via the Guarini Institute for International Education. Linguistics applicants use the standard application forms; anthropology applicants must complete the standard forms and one additional form relating to this program. Off-Campus Programs will obtain an up-to-date transcript. For application deadlines, please check the off campus program website. Selection Criteria Applicants will be evaluated on a combination of academic preparation, personal attributes, and the quality of their application essay. One important criterion will be the strength of the applicant’s preparation in anthropology and/or linguistics. Priority by class (at the time of application) will be as follows: (1) juniors, (2) sophomores, (3) first-years.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Anthropology Undergraduate Overview Major Modified Major Minor Global Health Minor How to Declare an Anthropology Major or Minor Courses Introductory Courses Archaeology Biological Anthropology Cultural Anthropology Independent Study Culminating Seminars Past Teaching Schedules Honors Program Honors Proposal Submission Form Transfer Credits Careers Alumni: Where Are They Now?
