Devices and machines are informing and affecting the abilities we once knew as innately human — perception, rationalization and intellect — creating powerful technologies and intelligent systems that allow for better decision-making in dynamic and complex environments. Rapid developments in sensing and autonomous technologies are transforming the industries. Moving forward, there will be extraordinary research opportunities to enhance and re-envision these technologies and systems to harness their potential and help make real-time decisions based on combinations of quantitative and qualitative data.
