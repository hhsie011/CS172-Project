Saunders Naomi J. Saunders I am a non-traditional stable isotope geochemist. In 2018, I received my PhD on stable Ni isotopic fractionation in high temperature terrestrial and lunar rocks from Oxford University, UK. I am currently working on several Ni isotope studies, expanding on this work and the explosion of recent interest in this area. I am also preparing to move into our new clean lab at LDEO, Alex Halliday's NICER Lab (Novel Isotopes in Climate, Environment, and Rocks). I am originally from Cumbria in the North of England, and grew up around the magnificent rocks of the Lake District. The Borrowdale volcanics and abundant local hematite started my interest in Geology, and led to an A level in the subject. The A level convinced me that this subject was going to be my passion, and ~10 years on nothing has changed! Fields of Interest High temperature geochemistry, isotope geochemistry, mantle geochemistry, Nickel, mantle recycling, petrology, mineral chemistry, lunar chemistry, meteorites, subduction zones, ocean islands, mid ocean ridges Education Oxford University (2010-2014; 2014-2018) Postdoctoral Research Scientist, Geochemistry Areas of Expertise high temperature geochemistry isotope geochemistry mantle geochemistry Nickel mantle recycling Contact Info Comer 119 61 Route 9W Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Palisades, NY 10964 USA 845-365-8927 [email protected] Twitter Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory61 Route 9W · Palisades, NY 10964 Phone 845-359-2900 Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
