Ronald Walton Eugene Liu Mien-hwa Chiang The mission of the Chinese Language Program The mission of the Chinese Language Program is to provide Chinese learning opportunities for members of the Penn community so that each learner becomes proficient in the Chinese language, more knowledgeable on Chinese culture, and personally more accepting in the current multilingual and globalized environment. The chief goal of the beginning- and intermediate-level courses is to develop learners’ functional skills so that learners are able to communicate with native speakers and comprehend written texts with the help of dictionaries. The chief goal of the advanced language courses is to educate cross-language, cross-cultural, and cross-disciplinary leaders for the business and government sectors, as well as to build modern Chinese and classic Chinese foundations for graduate and professional schools.
