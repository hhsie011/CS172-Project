The Texas A&M System Office of Governmental Relations provides a coordinated, system-wide approach to support funding initiatives and achieve policy goals for system members at the state and federal levels. The office includes the State Relations team and the Federal Relations team, which work together to support System members in advancing policy and funding goals to accomplish their education, research, and service objectives. Governmental relations maintain relationships with the Texas Legislature, Congress, statewide leaders, and state and federal agencies to garner support for System priorities. State Texas A&M System Office of State Relations: Together, the State Relations team members work with the Texas Legislature to represent the Texas A&M University System and its academic institutions, health science center, and state agencies. Through relationships with elected officials, statewide officeholders, state agencies, other universities, and stakeholders in Texas, State Relations supports the system’s land grant mission of service to the State of Texas and its citizens. The team is made up of subject matter experts across all major policy areas of state government, and each System member has a governmental relations officer assigned to represent the institution or agency in the legislative process. The State Relations team is headquartered in Austin, two blocks from the Texas State Capitol. It works with the Presidents, Agency Directors, Chief Financial Officers, Chief Academic Officers, and other key personnel at the universities and agencies to develop and advance their mission to provide the state with education, research, clinical care, and service.
