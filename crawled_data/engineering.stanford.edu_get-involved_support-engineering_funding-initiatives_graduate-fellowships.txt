As efforts to recruit the most promising scholars intensify in both academia and industry, competitive financial aid packages help ensure we can continue to attract the world’s best candidates. Preparing the next generation Graduate fellowships Graduate students are at the core of our academic ecosystem, playing a vital role in every aspect of our research and teaching mission. With increased fellowship funding, we can admit even more immensely talented students, offer more years of guaranteed funding, and provide robust aid packages. You can help us continue to inspire and prepare the next generation of engineering leaders who will help us navigate the challenges of the 21st century. Supporting dedicated students Coterm fellowships Some 40 percent of our undergraduates currently pursue a coterm degree, staying on an extra year to receive their bachelor’s and master’s degrees simultaneously. We believe these students are better prepared to land their first job and, ultimately, to tackle urgent global challenges. Stanford’s undergraduate aid ends with their bachelor’s degree, so students with the greatest need are least able to participate in this program. Help us make coterms accessible to more of our remarkable students. You can help Make Stanford a reality The School of Engineering’s future depends on our ability to make financial considerations a non‐factor in any promising student’s decision to attend Stanford or extend their degree program. Empowering top students with competitive aid allows them to pursue their passion for pushing the boundaries of knowledge and has a transformative impact on engineering research and education across the world. Your support is critical to our efforts. Funding a graduate fellowship The minimum gift to establish a fellowship is $250,000. A gift of $2 million creates a fully funded fellowship with an annual payout capable of supporting a graduate student for an academic year. “I feel fortunate to have received a fellowship … I am a triplet and my parents would have had difficulty paying for my graduate education on top of putting all three of us through an undergraduate program.” -Jesse Streicher, PhD candidate, Mechanical Engineering Studying the combustion chemistry of biofuels A fellowship success story Meet Jesse Reach out Individual: Matthew Bahls Director of Major Gifts 650.723.9043 mbahls@stanford.edu Corporate: Frank Scioscia Director of Strategic Partnerships 650.724.7703 frank.scioscia@stanford.edu More development staff Explore ways to give See how to give to Stanford Engineering.
