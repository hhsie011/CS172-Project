The findings could help shape public communications and policy. ClockMar 1 Mail LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Navigate to item Climate ChangeHuman Dimensions and SustainabilityNatural Hazards Researchers identify 'double-hazard' zones for wildfire in the West Rapidly growing communities in the American West’s forests and shrublands are nestled in zones where local soil and plant traits amplify the effect of climate change on wildfire hazards and lead to bigger burns. ClockFeb 7 Mail LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Navigate to item Climate ChangeNatural Hazards Climate of chaos: Why warming makes weather less predictable A Stanford University study shows chaos reigns earlier in midlatitude weather models as temperatures rise. The result? Climate change could be shifting the limits of weather predictability and pushing reliable 10-day forecasts out of reach. ClockDec 14 Mail LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Navigate to item Climate ChangeNatural Hazards Trees on the move: How wildfire accelerates forest changes As climate conditions change, tree species are shifting their ranges. Wildfire is accelerating this process, likely by reducing competition from established species – a finding that raises questions about how to manage land in an era of shifting ecosystems.

New research reveals the mechanism for these plumes could be tied to “hydraulic jumps” – a phenomenon Leonardo Da Vinci observed more than 500 years ago.

And California’s fire season is starting earlier and causing more devastation. Buzz Thompson, one of the country’s leading water law experts, discusses California’s wildfires, drought, water and climate change.

The findings underscore the value of reducing the risk of big, extreme wildfires and suggest pregnant people should avoid very smoky air. ClockAug 23 Mail LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Navigate to item Climate ChangeNatural Hazards Researchers use artificial intelligence to unlock extreme weather mysteries A new machine learning approach helps scientists understand why extreme precipitation days in the Midwest are becoming more frequent. It could also help scientists better predict how these and other extreme weather events will change in the future.

The model quantifies the conditions necessary to initiate the kind of caldera collapse that sustains big, damaging eruptions of basaltic volcanoes like Kīlauea and could help to inform forecasting and mitigation.
