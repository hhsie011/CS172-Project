The latest updates on COVID-19 and any impact to the Baylor University campus and/or University-sponsored travel are available at www.baylor.edu/coronavirus. More information about COVID-19 is available on the CDC website at www.cdc.gov/covid19. Baylor Bears On Wednesday, Dec. 11, 2019, Baylor University announced that Lady, one of the University’s two American Black Bear mascots, is undergoing an innovative, noninvasive radiation treatment for a benign mass, or thymoma, in her chest. The asymptomatic tumor was found during a routine wellness examination with veterinarians at Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences. 2019 Sic 'em for Safety Campaign September is National Preparedness Month, and it serves as an opportune time to share information regarding safety and security with new and returning students, faculty and staff on campus.Baylor University’s Department of Public Safety launched “Sic ‘em for Safety,” a safety awareness campaign aimed at providing the Baylor community with resources and information related to personal safety. Baylor Religion Survey The Baylor Religion Survey is the most extensive and sensitive study of religion ever conducted into American religious attitudes, behaviors and beliefs. With initial funding from the John Templeton Foundation and a partnership with the Gallup Organization, Baylor Religion Survey researchers have been able to provide context on several hot-button issues within America's religious landscape, such as the significance of religion in America, the "supersizing" of faith at America's Megachurches, religious and paranormal beliefs, the link between religion and physical and mental health, and religion's impact on work and entrepreneurship, among many other issues. Baylor Research and Innovation Collaborative The Baylor Research and Innovation Collaborative (BRIC) is the first, and cornerstone, facility of a 21-acre discovery complex that will evolve into the Central Texas Technology and Research Park as tenants populate the park over the next few decades. It will provide researchers, organizations and private companies with 300,000 square feet of physical space for labs, research centers, industry collaborative space, workforce training and symposia meeting venues for up to 300 attendees. Additionally, science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) space and an Innovative Business Accelerator are planned. Detecting Biomarkers for Cancer Baylor University chemist Dr. Touradj Solouki is attempting to identify biomarkers in human breath and saliva for early and noninvasive detection of cancer. He uses an ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometer to collect data and compares the molecular components found in a healthy person's breath with those found in the breath of a cancer patient. Eye Cancer App Helps Save Lives Bryan Shaw, Ph.D., assistant professor of chemistry, discovered, through the use of amateur digital photography, evidence of leukocoria or "white eye," the cardinal symptom of retinoblastoma, which can be seen in photographs during the earliest stages of the disease. His findings paved the way for a new diagnostic tool that enables earlier diagnosis and treatment. Retinoblastoma, mostly occurring in children from birth to 5-years-old, is an aggressive eye cancer that, if not treated in time, can be fatal if it spreads to the brain. Exhuming Immigrant Remains Baylor anthropologist Dr. Lori Baker, who was featured on the National Geographic Channel series, The Decrypters, took 18 students to a Texas border town to help identify those that died while crossing the Mexico-Texas border last summer. In May, Dr. Baker will return to the border to continue exhuming remains in an effort to identify the unknown.Baker, who was instrumental in developing a missing person's database with Mexico, works on behalf of her program called "Reuniting Families." She, along with her team, exhumes bodies at pauper's cemeteries and conducts DNA tests in an effort to identify the unknown and repatriate their remains to their families in Mexico. Fighting Tropical Diseases Baylor researchers conduct research that has the power to impact and save lives. They cross disciplines, the country and even the global to find cures for diseases that plague populations across the world and in developing countries. A group of professors are conducting research in areas of disease prevention to develop vaccines, treatments and plants in hopes of eradicating or reducing the threat of tropical diseases such malaria, West Nile Virus, dengue fever and Chagas disease. Higgs Boson Research Baylor University physicists have contributed to the Higgs Boson findings. Since 2010, Baylor researchers in the university's Experimental High Energy Physics group have been engaged in the experimental particle physics research being conducted at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland. The Baylor group has also been involved with similar research at Fermilab, a U.S. Department of Energy laboratory in Illinois, since 2005. The High Energy Physics group at Baylor is led by Dr. Jay Dittmann and Dr. Kenichi Hatakeyama. iCivics Baylor Model Founded by retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in 2009, iCivics provides youth access to engaging civics education through 16 online educational games that teach civics concepts. In 2011, the Baylor University School of Education, Baylor Law School, and Waco and Midway Independent School Districts collaborated on a nine-month long study to test the effectiveness of iCivics on primary and middle school students, which led to the development of the iCivics Baylor Model. Life Patterns in Extreme Environments In December 2013, Keith Schubert, Ph.D., associate professor of electrical and computer engineering in Baylor University's School of Engineering and Computer Science, was a key player on a team of academic and NASA scientists who explored Cueva de Villa Luz, a cave suffused with deadly sulfuric acid near Tapijulapa in Mexico, as part of an expedition funded by the National Geographic Society. Paul L. Foster Campus Leadership and Innovation Summit Paul L. Foster Campus for Business and Innovation Since 2001, Baylor University has invested more than $1 billion in new academic, residential and athletics facilities on its campus. In fall 2015, Baylor will open a dynamic new home for the UniversityÃ¢ÂÂs nationally ranked Hankamer School of Business: the $100 million, 275,000-square-foot Paul L. Foster Campus for Business and Innovation. Small Business and Community Health Research Counties and parishes with a greater concentration of small, locally-owned businesses have healthier populations - with lower rates of mortality, obesity and diabetes - than do those that rely on large companies with "absentee" owners, according to a national study by sociologists at Baylor University and LSU. Texas Hunger Initiative Housed within Baylor University, the Texas Hunger Initiative (THI) is a capacity-building, collaborative project dedicated to developing and implementing strategies to end hunger through policy, education, research, community organizing and community development. THI convenes federal, state and local government stakeholders with nonprofits, faith communities and business leaders to create an efficient system of accountability that increases food security in Texas. Water Quality Research Bryan W. Brooks, Ph.D., professor of environmental science and biomedical studies in Baylor University's College of Arts & Sciences and director of the environmental science graduate program and the environmental health science program, is a prominent researcher and conducts interdisciplinary research projects that often incorporate laboratory and field studies in aquatic, environmental and comparative toxicology, environmental risk assessment, and water resources. Whale Earplug Reveals Lifetime Contaminant Exposure and Hormone Profiles Baylor University researchers Dr. Stephen Trumble, assistant professor of biology, and Dr. Sascha Usenko, assistant professor of environmental science, are currently studying whale earplugs, specifically earwax, to learn more about the animal's possible exposure to contaminants and how pollutants affects its physiology. Data Privacy Day 2019 On Monday, Jan. 28, Baylor University will kick off a weeklong awareness campaign in conjunction with Data Privacy Day, an international effort launched by the National Cyber Security Alliance to educate people about the importance of respecting privacy, safeguarding data and enabling trust.
