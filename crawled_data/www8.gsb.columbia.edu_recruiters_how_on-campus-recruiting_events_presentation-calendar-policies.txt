Employment Reports Contact Us Second-Year Event Guidelines Joint-Year or First-Year Event Guidelines Career Fair Event Blackout Periods Pre-Interview Dinners & Sell Days Event Limit Policy Summer Semester 2022: January-term and EMBA students are in class over the summer and are available for information sessions and networking events. Fall Semester 2022: Companies are limited to hosting three events per class year (including virtual events), in addition to a single diversity event*. Examples of events that fall under this policy include: company information sessions, practice area networking events, social events, and invite-only events. Examples of events excluded from this policy include: coffee chats, multi-school events and multi-firm events. Individual and small group coffee chats and informational interviews may be scheduled directly with students, but students must not be asked to miss class. It is recommended to follow event date and time guidelines to ensure a student does not have an academic commitment. We encourage companies to be flexible when offering students the opportunity to engage in coffee chats. Different divisions (e.g., investment banking vs. asset management) or geographic offices within a company may qualify as separate entities for the purpose of this policy, but firms must receive prior approval from the CMC before planning an event *Companies may host multiple diversity events but must not allow individual students to attend more than one diversity event of their choice View larger image Second-Year Event Guidelines On-campus company events targeting only second-year students begin Tuesday, September 6, 2022. Events must be no more than 60 minutes long and event blackout periods apply. All events, including those that are virtual or taking place off-campus, must be submitted through COIN in order for the CMC to ensure a conflict-free calendar. Invitation-only events must be requested through COIN in order to avoid conflicts with other firms in your industry. See blackout periods below. Joint-Year or First-Year Event Guidelines No events involving first-year students may take place before September 21, 2022. Company representatives may not meet with first-year students in any capacity between Monday, August 22, 2022 and Monday, September 20, 2022. Events must be no more than 60 minutes long and event blackout periods apply. Invitation-only events may take place any evening after 6:30 p.m. between October 28 and December 8, 2022 (except during blackout periods). All events must be submitted through COIN in order for the CMC to ensure a conflict-free calendar. See blackout periods below. Career Fair The Career Fair is for companies that are new to recruiting at Columbia Business School or have not generated a high number of attendees at past events. Additionally, companies that don’t typically participate in on-campus recruiting are invited to attend as well. The School’s Annual Fall Career Fair will take place on Friday, September 23, 2022 from 11am to 2pm. Companies may participate in this event in lieu of holding a standalone event. No other company events may be booked on this day. Event Blackout Periods Companies may not host events, including informal networking, on blackout dates as follows: Yom Kippur September 23 Rosh Hashanah September 26-27 Yom Kippur October 4-5 Midterm exams October 17-21 Election Day holiday November 4-8 Thanksgiving holiday November 23-25 Study Days/Final Exams December 12-23 Winter Break December 24-January 3 Martin Luther King Jr. Day January 16 Midterm exams and Spring Break March 6-17 Final exams May 1-12 Commencement May 17 Pre-interview Events & Sell Days Pre-interview events are generally not allowed. Please consult your account manager about your company's circumstances. Sell Days should never conflict with academic commitments and are therefore best held on Fridays or Saturdays. Additionally, firms may not invite students to sell days or other post interview events until after offers are extended. Sidebar Content Post a Job Log Into COIN Make a Gift Have a Question?
