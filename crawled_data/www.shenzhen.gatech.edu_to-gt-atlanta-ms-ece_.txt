Afterward, they have the possibility of studying at GT-Shenzhen, GT-Lorraine, or GT-Atlanta and completing their degree program. Students who complete the entire Georgia Tech degree program in Shenzhen may participate in the graduation ceremony in Atlanta if they secure a proper U.S. visa (such as a tourist visa). Students applying for the exchange to the GT-Atlanta MS ECE program must have a Georgia Tech GPA of 3.25 or above (out of 4.0) and be in good disciplinary standing. GT-Shenzhen will perform multiple checks of this status before the exchange. Exchange students travel to Atlanta on an F-1 student visa and pay the applicable Atlanta campus tuition and fees. Their I-20 document must reflect the intended duration of stay and the financial resources required. F-1 visa holders should maintain full-time student registration of 12 credit hours or more during a spring or fall semester in Atlanta. Students sponsored by a foreign government or institution may only travel to the U.S. on a J-1 visa. See the GT Office of International Education (OIE) for more details. On-campus dormitory space is generally available to exchange students during the summer semester but may not be available during the fall or spring semester. The School of ECE offers GT-Shenzhen students the following tracks for completing the GT MS ECE degree. Track 1: Complete the entire MS degree program in Shenzhen. Track 2: Complete the first 24 credit hours in Shenzhen and the remaining 6 credit hours in Atlanta during the following summer semester. Students utilizing this option should plan on taking courses in Atlanta towards elective requirements of the MS degree due to limited course options during the summer. Track 3: Complete the first 18-24 credit hours in Shenzhen and study in Atlanta the following fall or spring semester. Track 4: Complete the first 15 credit hours in Shenzhen and study in Atlanta during the following fall & spring or spring & fall semesters. Note: Of the credit hours completed in Shenzhen, a minimum of 12 credit hours must be in ECE. Note: In the above, the number of completed credit hours refers to credit hours counted towards your GT MS ECE degree requirements. Please refer to the ECE Graduate Handbook for details regarding the degree requirements. To apply for an exchange, the student should email gtshenzhen@nullece.gatech.edu approximately 5 months before the start date of the exchange semester with the following information: Name, GTID, track choice, and which semester(s) the student wishes to study in Atlanta. Note that while GT-Shenzhen students may exchange to GT-Atlanta, the decision to grant the U.S. visa or not resides with the visa officer. Students with an F-1 visa may arrive in the U.S. 30 days before the start of the semester and may remain in the U.S. for 60 days following the completion of the degree program.
