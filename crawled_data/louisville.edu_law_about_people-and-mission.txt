(Brandeis professors) taught me how to think about policy- and law-related issues and how to articulate those points with respect to the law. The biggest impact they have had was to give me confidence that I can take on these roles: clerking for a federal judge, going to a big law firm in Kentucky and working for the U.S. Senate Majority Leader."
