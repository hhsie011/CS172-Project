Proposals should be for events that: fall within the mission of the Watson Institute, "to promote a just and peaceful world through research, teaching, and public engagement"; relate to themes residing squarely within the arena of international and public affairs; advance student knowledge about international and public affairs (as opposed to events more generally celebrating culture); benefit, inclusively, Brown's undergraduate community; and might seek to meet costs such as travel for guest speakers, publicity, and light refreshments, with a limit of $500 per event. Applications are assessed on a rolling basis.
