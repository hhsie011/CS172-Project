Most undergraduate majors require 120 units to graduate; therefore, the standard unit cap for undergraduates is 180 units (120 X 150%). Courses numbered 500 or higher are considered graduate courses and are weighted at 1.5 times their unit value. Most master's degree study plans require 30 graduate units; therefore, the standard unit cap for master's degree candidates is 67.5 units (30 weighted graduate units = 45 X 150%). Those majors and degrees requiring more than the standard number of units are shown in the chart below with the unit cap for each degree or credential program.
