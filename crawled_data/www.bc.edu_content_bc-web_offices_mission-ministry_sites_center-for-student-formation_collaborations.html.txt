Collaborations often vary in scope. Ranging from advice and guidance on how to improve an existing initiative, to designing and implementing brand new programs to meet student needs in a particular area, the Center for Student Formation tailors its support to the needs of the partner. The ultimate goal of each collaboration is that the partner ultimately assumes total ownership of the program to ensure its long term sustainability. How can I collaborate with the Center for Student Formation? If you're interested in collaborating with the Center for Student Formation please contact the Executive Director, Mike Sacco at saccomi@bc.edu. Since its inception, the Center for Student Formation has collaborated with a wide range of partners from every corner of the university to develop unique formational programs. We encourage you to consider inquiring about a potential partnership if you have formational needs or ideas. Collaborations are considered on a case by case basis and depend on available resources at the time of inquiry.

The Asian Caucus is a particularly well run student organization that provides a tremendous amount of support for its student participants. For this reason, many Asian students only participate in Asian Caucus programs and our assistance with the student leaders was meant to build a bridge to other university programs.</p> <p><em>Partner: Asian Caucus</em></p> <p> </p> bc:offices/Mission-Ministry/student-formation/collaborations/search-tags/Asian-Caucus-FFP CTP Parent Welcome <h3><span class="maroon">CTP Parent Welcome</span> </h3> <p>A partnership with the Learning to Learn office to redesign their Parent Orientation.

The program previously did not include this important initial bonding experience and as such lacked cohesion. The one night overnight that features student talks of upperclassmen who are CTP alumni added a tremendous amount to the other parts of the established program.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Partner: Learning to Learn</em></p> bc:offices/Mission-Ministry/student-formation/collaborations/search-tags/ctp-retreat Compass Program <h3><span class="maroon">Compass Program</span></h3> <p>A mentorship program for first year students of color. The program was designed to provide immediate support of students of color when they come to campus in the fall. There are many resources for students of color on campus, but it often can take weeks or months to identify them. Compass groups begin on the very first day of school to help upperclassmen connect to mentors of color.</p> <p><i>Partner: First Year Experience</i></p> bc:offices/Mission-Ministry/student-formation/collaborations/search-tags/Compass-Program Connell School Nurse Practitioner Program <h3><span class="maroon">Connell School Nurse Practitioner Program</span> </h3> <p>The nurse practitioner program in the Connell School is highly intensive and has a mix of young graduate students and older adults. The Center for Student Formation helped them design a one day retreat for these students to help the two informal groups of students intermingle, and to provide vocational discernment support by featuring faculty and alumni speakers.</p> <p><i>Partner: Connell School of Nursing</i></p> Graduate bc:offices/Mission-Ministry/student-formation/collaborations/search-tags/Connell-School-Nurse-Practitioner-Program Conversation Project <h3><span class="maroon">Conversation Project</span> </h3> <p>This program was designed to provide students who get in trouble a conversation partner from outside of the conduct process.

The purpose of the program was to bring high school students onto campus for a weeklong program to explore their faith through a variety of programming and exposure to BC undergraduate mentors. The Center for Student Formation helped provide logistical support and creative insight into what types of activities would work best with the participants.<em></em></p> <p><em>Partner: Institute of Advanced Jesuit Studies</em></p> bc:offices/Mission-Ministry/student-formation/collaborations/search-tags/ever-to-excel GPS <h3><span class="maroon">GPS: Navigating Graduate Student Life at BC</span><br> </h3> <p>An overnight retreat for graduate students to introduce vocational discernment since many grad students come from undergraduate institutions that do not provide that type of service.

The thinking behind the program was that it is often graduate students who have the most contact with undergraduates when they work closely with them as retreat coordinators or service trip participants. By giving graduate students a formational experience in Jesuit education they could hopefully pass that on to undergraduate students as well as benefitting themselves in their graduate education.<em></em></p> <p><em>Partner: Intersections</em></p> bc:offices/Mission-Ministry/student-formation/collaborations/search-tags/Graduate-Foundation-Seminars Graduate School of Social Work Retreat <h3><span class="maroon">Graduate School of Social Work Retreat</span></h3> <p>A retreat for students in the graduate school of social work for fall 2018.

There can never be enough opportunities for students to engage in questions of race and identity and this particular program’s blend of an academic approach and a personal approach provided a unique experience for students to engage in a conversation about diversity.</p> <p><em>Partner: Thea Bowman AHANA Student Programs</em></p> bc:offices/Mission-Ministry/student-formation/collaborations/search-tags/RIDE Residence Life Personnel <h3><span class="maroon">Residence Life Personnel</span> </h3> <p>This collaboration involved providing support to the director and associate director of Reslife to aid in the recruitment, selection and training of reslife personnel.

As such, the Center for Student Formation worked with athletics to create 3, 2 week long, concurrent seminars for each class of the football program on the history of BC and Boston, leadership, and vocation. Each class (sophomores, juniors, seniors) spent 2 weeks hearing lectures from BC faculty and visiting guests, participating in workshops, and going on field trips in and around Boston to give football players a short, but intense experience with a variety of formational programming.</p> <p><em>Partner: Athletics</em></p> bc:offices/Mission-Ministry/student-formation/collaborations/search-tags/SummerFootballProgram The Experience of Pilgrimage <h3><span class="maroon">Self-Knowledge and Discernment: The Experience of Pilgrimage</span> </h3> <p>A 3-credit philosophy course for 10 students that takes place while walking the Camino de Santiago. The program was designed to help students grow intellectually, socially and spiritually. The purpose of this unique academic experience, a 3 credit course taken while hiking across northern Spain on a centuries old pilgrimage route, was to provide an intellectual immersion experience for students seeking time and space to wrestle with big questions about themselves and their world.</p> <p><i>Partner: Professor Jeff Bloechl and the philosophy department</i></p> bc:offices/Mission-Ministry/student-formation/collaborations/search-tags/The-Experience-of-Pilgrimage Thrive <h3><span class="maroon">Thrive</span></h3> <p>Thrive was created in partnership with the Women’s Center as a mentorship program to provide an opportunity and space for sophomore women to discuss their experience.</p> <p><i>Partner: Women’s Center</i></p> bc:offices/Mission-Ministry/student-formation/collaborations/search-tags/Thrive Voices of Transformation <h3><span class="maroon">Voices of Transformation</span></h3> <p>Retreat talks by students are often very powerful and instructive for student participants.
