Below is a Question of the Day that relates to topics raised in recent Town Halls: How do I reschedule my appointment for the second dose? It is strongly recommended that you keep your appointment date for your second dose. If you tested POSITIVE for COVID-19 and are on home isolation OR if you were exposed to COVID-19 and are on home quarantine, you may receive your second dose AFTER you have met criteria to return to work and been cleared by the WH&S Hotline (646-697-9470). If you are unable to receive the second dose on the originally scheduled date for any reason, it should be given as close as possible to the original date. You can reschedule through Connect. If you are not currently registered, you may do so here. NOTE: You will be able to reschedule AFTER you miss your original second dose appointment. Thank you and stay safe!
