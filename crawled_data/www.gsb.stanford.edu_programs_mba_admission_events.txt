We offer many opportunities to engage with students, alumni, and admissions staff online or in cities around the world. If you are thinking about applying, we welcome you to attend an admission event, though a visit to campus is not required or expected. Explore your interests and specific topics with our recently recorded events — your journey, your Stanford, your questions, and your application. Whether you are exploring business school for the first time or are ready to apply, find upcoming events in our schedule that meet your needs. Most MBA Admissions events are virtual while COVID-19 protocols are still in place. We offer online information sessions and small-group chats with students, alumni, and admission officers. In addition, we are hosting some in-person events including our flagship diversity conferences, Women in Leadership and Diversity in Leadership this May. We are also offering On-campus Class Visits and Chat with an Admissions Officer events on select dates at the Knight Management Center. Registration is required. Please note these on-campus events are subject to local and university health policy and are subject to change. Keep in mind that visiting campus has no bearing on any current or future application or admission decision On-Campus Information Sessions & Tours On-campus information sessions and tours are currently on hold during the pandemic. However, online Information Sessions are still available. Information sessions are opportunities for you to get a detailed overview of the Stanford MBA Program’s distinctive features and admission process and to get your questions answered. We also invite MBA students to share their experiences at information sessions held during the academic year. Advance registration is required. In addition, we encourage you to check out our virtual 360-degree tour until in-person tours resume in the coming months. On-Campus Chats with Students These 45-minute chats are hosted by students. You have the opportunity to meet in a small, informal group and ask questions about the Stanford GSB experience. The focus of these chats is on the immersive living and learning experience, not the admission or application process. Advance registration is required. Class Visit Program We offer limited spaces for prospective students to observe the Stanford GSB academic experience in real time. If you are seriously considering applying to the program, you can register for a morning or afternoon session. Class visit assignments are allocated on the day of the event. To optimize visitor experience, we present a diverse range of classes that highlight the MBA curriculum. We do our best to accommodate individual preferences when capacity and demand allow. To minimize the potential for class disruptions, you must be registered to attend a class; we cannot guarantee the ability to accommodate walk-in or standby visitors. We also ask that you sign up for only one class per quarter and stay for the full duration of the class. Class visits generally begin a week after the start of the academic quarter and are posted a few weeks before the term begins. No class visits are offered during the summer. Make your reservation two to three weeks in advance; spaces fill up quickly. Virtual Events While you are welcome to visit us, we know that not everyone can. We frequently offer admission events online and invite you to view our archived events. Be sure to check our admission event calendar for upcoming web-based events and sign up to be notified when new events are scheduled. Coffee Chats Last year we held 110 coffee chats in over forty countries. These are informal discussions hosted by current students and recent alumni about life at Stanford GSB. We would love to meet you! See our Admission Events Calendar for details and to sign up. Worldwide Events We hold hundreds of admission events throughout the world, primarily from May through September. We would love to see you while we are on the road!

Diversity Events Stanford GSB is a diverse community where people learn from — and teach — each other. Each MBA class is diverse in the broadest possible terms, including educational and professional background, personal experience, goals, culture, interest and aspiration, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, and nationality. We offer events throughout the year that address the perspectives and experiences of specific audiences. Everyone is welcome to attend. Veterans Visit Day: Hosted by the Stanford GSB Veterans Club, this program is focused on active-duty and former members of the armed forces considering business school. This year’s (virtual) Veterans Visit Day will take place on May 19, 2021. Women in Leadership: An event focused on the advancement of women in business. This year’s Women in Leadership event is on Saturday, May 14, 2022 in Palo Alto, California. Diversity in Leadership: An event supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion in business. This year’s Diversity in Leadership event is on Sunday, May 15, 2022 in Palo Alto, California.. Diversity events focus on the perspectives and experiences of specific communities, including, but not limited to, women, LGBTQ, U.S. minorities, and/or U.S. veterans. These events, however, are open to all. Partner Events You may also find us at off-campus events sponsored by other organizations, including: CHeck uS Out: MBA LGBT Open House The Riordan Programs Alumni Association Diversity MBA Admissions Conference Management Leadership for Tomorrow American Indian Science and Engineering Society JumpStart Reaching Out MBA Conference 00:05:38 See Yourself Here Imagine yourself at Stanford GSB.
