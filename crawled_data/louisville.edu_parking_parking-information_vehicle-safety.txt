Always double check to see that all car doors and windows are secure; lock your car and take the keys with you. Do not go alone. It's not always possible but it's still good advice. Carry small loads at a time, keeping arms free for movement. Carry your keys at the ready. As you approach your vehicle, OBSERVE IT. Look around the vehicle. Look into the front and back seats before unlocking the door. As soon as you are safely in your vehicle, lock the door. Never hitchhike, and never pick up a hitchhiker. Keep your vehicle in good repair. Never let your gas gauge get below one quarter of a tank. Be aware of your surroundings. Walk with confidence. When a criminal selects a victim, in most cases, he looks for three things: A person who appears to be weak/vulnerable. A person who is unaware of surroundings, not paying attention. Opportunity. OTHER SUGGESTIONS Keep car keys and house keys on separate rings. Never have an identification tag such as a miniature license or name plate on your key ring. This only helps the thief locate your car should your keys be lost or stolen. Never hide an extra car key under the hood or wheel well; criminals know where to look for hidden keys. Carry a spare key on your person. Do not keep your vehicle registration inside your car. Carry it with you, perhaps with your driver's license. Record the VIN (Vehicle Identification Number), registration and license plate number and keep them in a safe place. Also, attach a photograph of your vehicle. Carry insurance. Secure valuables and parcels in your trunk. If your car does not have a trunk, make sure parcels are not left in plain view inside your car. Mark your social security number on equipment and accessories in your car, such as the battery, stereo, hubcaps, etc. Avoid bumper stickers that might antagonize individuals or groups. Avoid antagonizing other drivers. Travel on main streets and highways as much as possible. If you feel you are being followed, drive to the nearest police station or populated area and sound the horn for help. If you see a disabled vehicle or suspicious persons, do not stop. Drive to a nearby telephone and inform the police of the vehicle's location. If you are on any of the University of Louisville campuses, call the Department of Public Safety at 852-6111 immediately.
