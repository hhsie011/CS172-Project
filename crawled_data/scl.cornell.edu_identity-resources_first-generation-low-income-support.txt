Our work is grounded in a holistic, intersectional approach to foster an educational environment for FGLI students to succeed and thrive at Cornell.As a unit in the Dean of Students, Diversity and Inclusion portfolio, we aim to promote and centralize academic and social resources to remove institutional barriers to allow, first-generation and/or low-income students to benefit from an inclusive and transformational educational experience. Did you know....19.4% of the students in the incoming class of 2025 self-identify as first-generation college students. We consider you a first-generation college student if you come from a family in which neither of your parents or guardians has obtained a four-year college degree. We consider you a low-income student if you have little or no expected parent contribution as part of your financial aid package, you are a recipient of the Pell grant, or you believe that your prior academic and social experiences have been limited due to your socioeconomic status. First Forward Institution The Center for First-Generation Student Success launched in June 2017, with the mission of being the premier source of evidence-based practices, professional development, and knowledge creation for the higher education community to advance the success of first-generation students. In continuing this mission, the Center launched First-gen Forward, the nationâ€™s first recognition program acknowledging higher education institutions for their commitment to first-generation student success. Cornell University is a member of the 2020-2021 First-gen Forward Cohort. Student Organizations The First Generation Student Union student-run organization works collectively to foster an inclusive community for first-generation, low-income (FGLI) students and are committed to making sure FGLI Cornellians find a true sense of belonging. Support the Access Fund Support the First-Generation and Low-Income Student Support Center, a new initiative out of the Dean of Students Office, by making a gift to the Access Fund. The Access Fund allows us the flexibility to better meet student needs and your gift will help in a multitude of ways. The Access Fund provides financial support to help low-income students cover emergency expenses, meet basic needs, and to participate in transformative experiences that would not be possible without financial assistance.
