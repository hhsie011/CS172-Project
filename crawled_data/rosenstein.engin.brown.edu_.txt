Nanopore sensors, ion channels, and electrophysiology We are developing high-performance electronic systems for nanopore sensors for the next generation of single-molecule DNA sequencing, as well as looking into new ways to measure and use ion channel proteins with electronic systems. Chemical information systems How can we better use electronics to acquire and process chemical information, and how can we use chemicals for information storage and computation? Mixed-signal electronics We want to be at the cutting edge of extending and applying mixed-signal design techniques to ultra-low-power and ultra-low-noise applications. Ubiquitous sensing and computing We think everything should be electronically active, and are exploring new ways to integrate electronic features into things around us.
