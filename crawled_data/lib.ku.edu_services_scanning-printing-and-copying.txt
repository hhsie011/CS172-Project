The MFD devices allow for printing (black and white, color, and duplex), scanning, and copying to be done on a single device, increasing the availability of these services and eliminating the need for multiple printers and scanners. The system for printing requires users to log in at the device to release the print job, which provides a more secure way of printing, prevents other users from photocopying documents using your funds, and reduces the number of unclaimed print jobs. More information cant be found at: General printing information Printing & copying FAQs Information for Library Visitors Each fall and spring semester, all currently enrolled students will receive $8 (100 black & white pages) worth of free printing. Each summer session, all currently enrolled students will receive $4 (50 black & white pages) worth of free printing. These funds are brought to students by KU Student Senate and are available on any public printing device on campus, including the libraries and computer labs. The free printing funds do not carry-over to the following semester or summer session. Once the student's funds for the current semester are expended, they will need to add money to their Beak 'Em Bucks account in order to print.
