The new programs, new endowed chair positions, and the graduate fellowships needed to provide mentorship to undergraduate students and scholarly research that enhances Baylor's presence within its priority areas will only be accomplished with the Baylor Family's support of endowment. Prestigious chairs and professorship positions, secured by endowed funds dedicated to the long-term support of programs and research, will help the University attract outstanding Christian scholars who currently only find this support in larger state schools and private universities that have forfeited their faith foundation. The funding of graduate fellowships to provide research support, while helping to attract highly qualified and high-achieving graduate students, will also ease the burden to help faculty remain in the classroom, a hallmark of the Baylor experience. Additionally, a growing endowment impacts the University's goal to hold tuition costs at levels that make a Baylor education accessible to students from all walks of life. A robust endowment is the foundation upon which Baylor will rise.
