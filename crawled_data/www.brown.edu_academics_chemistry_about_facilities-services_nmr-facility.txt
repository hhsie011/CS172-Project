In addition there are two Bruker data processing stations. The 600, both 400s, and the processing stations are located in GeoChem 410 and the remaining 300 is located in MacMillan 315. The website for making reservations on the NMR spectrometers is http://faces.ccrc.uga.edu. To use the instruments, one must attend a training class and be issued a computer login with password. If you are interested in attending a training session, please contact facilities supervisor Russ Hopson.
