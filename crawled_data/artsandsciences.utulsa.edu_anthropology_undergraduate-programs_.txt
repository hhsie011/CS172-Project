To understand the full sweep and complexity of cultures across all of human history, anthropology draws and builds upon knowledge from the social and biological sciences as well as the humanities and physical sciences. Anthropologists are highly specialized in their research interests, yet remain generalists in their observations of the human condition and advocate for a public anthropology that is committed to bringing knowledge to broad audiences. The Department of Anthropology at The University of Tulsa offers a BA degree and certificate in museum studies. The hallmark of our department is the individual relationships between students and faculty and the engagement of all students in cutting-edge research. We offer state-of-the-art labs, which allow us to combine experimental archaeological analyses with extensive fieldwork worldwide. Theses are examples of possible four-year plans for an anthropology major at TU. Specific courses are subject to availability and scheduling. The aim of these examples is to illustrate possible major/minor combinations and possible classes. For more information please contact the undergraduate advisor Miriam Belmaker. Program Objectives Students who complete the Bachelor’s degree will demonstrate or perform: Anthropological comprehension of theories, human cultures, and social groups.
