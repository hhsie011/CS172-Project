The passcode requirement applies to all meetings, including instant meetings, scheduled meetings, and meetings using a Personal Meeting ID. Please review the information for Zoom meeting hosts, organizers, and participants as OSU transitions to this new security requirement. Meeting Host and Organizer Information Scheduling or Hosting Meetings Please review your existing meetings. For meetings that have already been created with a password, you don’t need to do anything. For recurring or scheduled meetings taking place after or continuing past September 10th that are not protected with a password, you will need to add a passcode. Be sure to communicate the change to participants and provide them an update join link and the passcode. Instructions: Add a Passcode to an Existing Zoom Meeting. Important: If you don’t add a passcode to meetings scheduled to take place after September 10th, Zoom will automatically assign a passcode. Participants will not be able to join the meeting without the passcode or an updated join link with a passcode embedded. Example Join Links: Join link without a passcode: https://oregonstate.zoom.us/j/91293498675 This type of link requires the participant to enter the passcode. Join link with a passcode: https://oregonstate.zoom.us/j/91293498675?pwd=WTFKQmh2MEFSTlo4cFd2WFptbkZpdz09 This type of link includes the passcode embedded, shown in yellow, and does not require the participant to enter the passcode. Using Your Personal Meeting ID (PMI) Meetings that use your Personal Meeting IDs (PMI) will also be password protected. Your PMI will use a unique password that stays the same for every meeting. Zoom will auto-generate the first password for your PMI but you can customize it via your Zoom profile page on the Zoom web portal. To enable others to join meetings using your PMI, they will need to enter the passcode or using a join link with an embedded passcode. To add or edit the passcode for your Personal Meeting ID (PMI), follow the steps below: Sign in to the Zoom web portal and navigate to Meetings. Click Personal Meeting Room. Click Edit this Meeting. In the Security section, edit the passcode. You can also enable the Waiting Room if desired. Click Save. Are passcodes required for webinars? No, the September 10th passcode requirement only applies to meetings. You can choose to enable a passcode for your webinar if you'd like, but they are not apart of the requirement. Meeting Participant Information Joining Scheduled Meetings After September 10, if you join a scheduled Zoom meeting by clicking the join link in an email invitation or through a desktop calendar invitation with the passcode embedded, nothing will change. If the meeting password is embedded in the link, there is no need to enter it manually. If you join a meeting by entering a Meeting ID, or a meeting link that does not have a passcode embedded, you will be required to enter a password. The meeting password can be found in the invite sent to you by the host underneath the meeting ID. If you do not have the passcode, contact the meeting host as soon as possible. If you are manually joining the meeting, by entering the Meeting ID, you will be required to enter the passcode. Examples: Join link without a passcode: https://oregonstate.zoom.us/j/91293498675 This type of link requires the participant to enter the passcode. Join link with a passcode: https://oregonstate.zoom.us/j/91293498675?pwd=WTFKQmh2MEFSTlo4cFd2WFptbkZpdz09 This type of link includes the passcode embedded, shown in yellow, and does not require the participant to enter the passcode. Joining an instant meeting using a Personal Meeting ID (PMI) Like scheduled meetings, the meeting host will need to provide you the passcode if you are manually entering the meeting ID or are using a join link without the passcode embedded. If the join link includes "pwd" as shown in yellow for example below, you will not be required to enter the passcode to join the meeting. Join link without a passcode: https://oregonstate.zoom.us/j/4515554400 This type of link requires the participant to enter the passcode.

Passcode FAQs Should I apply passcodes to my existing meetings before the requirement?
