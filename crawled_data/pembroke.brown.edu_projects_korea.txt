In 2015, the Pembroke Center signed memoranda of understanding with Ewha Womans University (the largest women’s university in the world) and Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. The agreements were created in order to facilitate the exchange of students and joint research ventures among faculty at Brown and those universities. The Center has focused on three points of collaboration: discussions about “regional feminism” (supported by our Korean colleagues) and national/international feminism; the question of the feminist archive; and collaborations between Pembroke’s journal differences and Yonsei’s Situations.
