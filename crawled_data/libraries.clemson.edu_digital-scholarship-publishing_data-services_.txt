The research data lifecycle has many stages, and librarians have a unique set of skills and training to assist in research data stewardship. We offer many training opportunities throughout the year, and we are also available to come to your class or lab group to talk about topics such as reproducibility, Open Data, documenting and preserving data, finding and using datasets, and licensing your data for use by others. Data Management Plans A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a (usually) 2-page component of a grant proposal for funding agencies like NSF, NIH, USDA, or DOE. We partner with the Office of Research Development to offer guidance and assistance for this important part of your grant proposal via training workshops, one-on-one consultations, and DMP content editing. Email our team at cudatamgmt@nulllists.clemson.edu to get started. And for a deeper dive into Data Management Plans, visit our Data Services guide. Open Data & Data Availability Statements If you’re interested in making your research data openly available, we can help! We can also help you craft a Data Availability Statement for your publisher, select an appropriate license for your data, give your dataset a DOI, and more. Email Megan Sheffield (msheff@nullclemson.edu) to learn more. Managing & Archiving Data Even if you’re not writing it up for a grant, good data management practices are crucial to making research reproducible, and Clemson Libraries has the expertise to help you determine the best strategies for your specific situation. We can also help archive your data to make sure it is preserved long-term, which can include creating metadata or selecting an appropriate repository.
