That mission demands we team up with like-minded global institutions to pursue world-class collaborative research, education and outreach. NC State Global oversees all of NC State’s internationalization efforts, from formalizing strategic partnerships with universities abroad to hosting international hubs and consortia here in Raleigh.

Strategic partners provide the necessary infrastructure (staffing, administrative, teaching and research space) that enable faculty, staff and students to focus on instruction, research and engagement. NC State Global serves as the liaison with international offices at partner universities to expand study abroad opportunities, recruit international students, integrate international experience into academic programs and develop new global academic curricula.
