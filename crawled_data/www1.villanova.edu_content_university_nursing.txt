JULY 14, 2021 SHARE MORE > MSNO: Ready to Build Community Connections with Students of Color Born from the desire of four sophomore nursing students to create meaningful academic and social connection for themselves, the Multicultural Student Nurses Organization (MSNO) was launched in March, the newest student organization in the Fitzpatrick College of Nursing (FCN). The founders - Naomi Tegene, Dominica Villegas, Salina Berhane and Caprice Beato-Lembert - brought their dream to fruition since the idea germinated last year as a study group. The students soon realized that through their shared experiences and backgrounds they could help more underrepresented students in the FCN. Building community was a guiding star in the development of their new organization- a sentiment which all four echo. APRIL 28, 2021 SHARE MORE > MORE NEWS CONNECT WITH VU 800 E.
