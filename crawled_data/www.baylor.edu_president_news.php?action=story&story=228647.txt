I’m very much looking forward to joining faculty and staff at the Baylor Club from 5:30-7 p.m. for “A Celebration of R1 Achievement,” featuring music, a strolling supper, some brief remarks and a few surprises to highlight this significant moment for Baylor – and the people who made it happen. As we envision what R1 status will mean for Baylor’s future, it’s always meaningful to hear of its impact from our faculty who played such a key role. Many of them shared their thoughts in the Spring issue of Baylor Magazine. From the ways R1 will advance our Christian mission, elevate their research, provide opportunities for students, serve the community and more, their insights highlight the many reasons R1 is so meaningful for Baylor. We look forward to celebrating this Monday! Some updates for this week: Faculty and Staff: We have extended the RSVP deadline for Monday’s “A Celebration of R1 Achievement” event, but we need you to register TODAY. You are welcome to bring a guest. We announced earlier this year Baylor had met the initial $1.1 billion Give Light Campaign goal and that this important philanthropic initiative would continue. All of our academic units are making consistent progress on campaign goals, with four surpassing their goals in the past year – Baylor Law School, Truett Seminary, School of Music and Baylor Libraries. Student scholarships also have been a priority of the campaign, and tomorrow night we will host “Celebration of Giving” to extend our appreciation to the many donors who have made transformational gifts throughout the campaign and others who have invested in endowed scholarships throughout the years. This is a wonderful opportunity to bring these generous donors and their student scholarship recipients together for an evening of thanksgiving and to celebrate all we’ve accomplished together for Baylor through the Give Light campaign. This week the Honors College celebrates J. Harry and Anna Jeanes Academic Honors Week. Now in its 30th year, Honors Week features more than 100 Honors College seniors presenting their thesis research and a banquet celebrating graduating seniors of the Honors Program and University Scholars. Honors Week will culminate with Academic Honors Convocation tomorrow, which celebrates outstanding students from every academic unit at Baylor. We remain grateful to the late Harry (’34) and Anna Jeanes (’34) for their transformational support of student scholarships, Academic Honors Week and the Mayborn Museum. As we wind down the spring semester, the student award season is just getting started. Our students are shattering records as they’ve earned some of the most prestigious – and competitive – international and national scholarships for critical language study, STEM research, public policy and more. These awards include a Baylor-record 13 student Fulbrights – a number likely to place Baylor among the top producers of Fulbright Scholars at U.S. research institutions – as well as our first Truman Scholar in 15 years and recipients of the Goldwater, Critical Language and Churchill scholarships. We expect to share more good news soon as we have finalists for more Fulbrights, as well as the Udall Undergraduate Scholarship and Boren Awards. In addition, I want to acknowledge our Office of Engaged Learning, which excels at helping our students maximize their undergraduate experience, and the many faculty and staff who invest deeply in our students to help them flourish. With final projects, exams, graduation and summer break around the corner, now is an important time for students to take care of your mental and physical well-being. All Baylor students have access to free 24/7 care, even when you’re off-campus. Students who are feeling run d0wn physically or struggling with mental health concerns can access on-demand telehealth services at no cost from anywhere by visiting baylor.academiclivecare.com. You may also make in-person appointments through Baylor’s Counseling Center and Health Services. I encourage all students to take advantage of these resources to help support your health and well-being. Another great campus resource is the Baylor Career Center. The Career Center staff offers a personalized approach to help all students search for jobs, internships and graduate school opportunities quickly and readily. Graduating seniors: If you haven’t worked with the Career Center yet, be sure to make an appointment for a resume review, mock interviews, salary negotiation and other assistance that will make your transition into the professional world smoother. Also, check out this article in The Wall Street Journal published yesterday highlighting the creative ways that our Career Center works with students and employers to provide unique recruiting opportunities. This is Green and Gold Weekend, with a host of athletics and alumni activities scheduled across the campus beginning tomorrow. I hope to see you at McLane Stadium on Saturday at noon for the annual Green and Gold Spring Football Game. Linda A. Livingstone, Ph.D. President PHOTO OF THE WEEK We are grateful for the seeds planted decades ago by faculty and former leaders that have enabled Baylor to blossom into a Christian R1 university.
