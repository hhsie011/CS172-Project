The document outlines University policy in the following areas: freedom of academic inquiry, freedom of expression, freedom of association, right to privacy, off-campus freedom, student self-government, right of students to participate in University government and the decision-making process, and standards in disciplinary proceedings. More detailed information concerning any of these areas may be obtained from the Office of Student Affairs. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a Federal law governing the privacy of student education records. Under FERPA, eligible students have the right to review their education records, to request amendment of records, to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information from those records, and to file complaints with the U.S. Department of Education. In addition, FERPA defines the circumstances in which student information may be disclosed without written consent of the student. FERPA allows schools to disclose student information without written consent by the student where the information has been properly designated as “directory information,” where the disclosure is to school official with a legitimate educational interest in the education records, and where the disclosure fits within one of the other exceptions identified in 34 C.F.R. § 99.31. To learn more, please see the University of Tulsa’s Notification of Rights under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), at www.utulsa.edu/ferpa. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) This act includes provisions to protect the privacy of individually identifiable health information. For more information about the HIPAA and related University policies, contact the Office of Human Resources. General Standard of Conduct In keeping with the ideals and standards of higher education and the mission of The University of Tulsa, students are expected to treat one another and other members of the University community with mutual respect, dignity, honor, and trust. Specifically, students are expected to respect order, fairness, morality, and the rights of others; obey the laws of the land and the regulations, rules, and policies of the University; and conduct their activities with high regard for the ideals of higher education, which include personal honor, academic honesty, and intellectual freedom. Behavior that runs contrary to these expectations provides sufficient cause for the University to initiate disciplinary proceedings, as specified on the Student Affairs website. The full text of the General Standard of Conduct as well as the rules and regulations governing student life and policies governing such issues as drug and alcohol use, sexual harassment, sexual violence, and harassment may be found on the Student Affairs website.
