Because these allowances are estimates, a student’s actual expenses may be slightly higher or lower than what is covered by your overall funding. Students are not required to submit receipts or any documentation to the Office of Financial Aid to substantiate their actual expenses. However, if a student would like to explore the option of borrowing additional loan funds to cover expenses that exceed the standard allowance, documentation must be provided. This can be done by contacting our office at financial_aid@brown.edu. A financial aid counselor can discuss this option and provide information regarding the feasibility of borrowing loan funds to cover expenses in excess of the standard allowance.
