Our return to campus this fall marks an exciting time at CBS as we prepare to move to our new home at Manhattanville. The disruption and change that we experienced over the past 15 months has created opportunity to transform the way we think about many facets of our lives including healthcare, banking, transportation, real estate, and human resource management, among others. It has also raised awareness of important societal issues that we must address. Our innovative curriculum will prepare you to lead a global recovery over the next few years and longer term. I look forward to seeing what we can accomplish together.
