Since 1851, FSU has been unwavering in the pursuit of this objective. The Office of Critical Thinking Initiatives was developed to further success in this area. One of the major ways in which the Office of Critical Thinking Initiatives meets its objectives is to support faculty as they develop critical thinking skills among our students. This page is dedicated to resources that assist in FSU’s current approach to developing critical thinking.
