Freshmen by the numbers At the UW, you are more than test scores and a GPA, but we know that you’re curious about the numbers anyway. CADRs All freshman and transfer applicants must complete a minimum level of preparation in six subject areas. This requirement ensures that students entering the UW have an appreciation for the liberal arts and are adequately prepared to succeed in college. Learn more about satisfying CADRs.

Exams for credit We get asked about which path is best…a lot. Should you take Advanced Placement (AP) courses? How about International Baccalaureate (IB) or A-Level and AS-Level exams? The UW encourages and applauds participation in any of these programs. They are challenging and demanding, and we believe they provide excellent preparation for university study. Find details and useful links below. Advanced Placement (AP) International Baccalaureate (IB) A Level and AS Level exams Admission to majors Your admission to a major at the UW depends on the major you are interested in and your application type.

College Academic Distribution Requirements (CADRs) All freshman applicants are required to meet minimum academic distribution requirements as set by the Washington Student Achievement Council (WSAC) and the faculty of the UW. Learn more about freshman CADRs. Transcripts Do not send transcripts until you receive a request from the Office of Admissions. The application asks you to provide a detailed account of your academic coursework, and that’s all we need to review your application. Applicants who are admitted and who confirm their intention to enroll at the UW will be required to send final transcripts. At that time, we will verify that all admission requirements have been satisfied. The offer of admission may be withdrawn if important discrepancies are discovered. Final college transcripts are also required for applicants who attended college. I applied. Now what? We appreciate the time and effort that you put into your application to the UW.
