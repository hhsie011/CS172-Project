Gifts to the annual fund provide critical support for programs and expenses in the college that have no other dedicated funding source, and it allows the flexibility to address the most pressing needs that arise on a daily basis. Annual fund donors giving $2,500 or more are recognized as members of the Dean’s Circle, making them a dedicated group of partners with a proud stake in TU’s success. Examples of past uses of Dean’s Circle funds include: Student organized TedX talk Student research colloquiums Student travel to participate in the National Student Advertising Competition Etiquette dinners for more than 150 students Partnered with the admissions office to increase student recruitment efforts by subsidizing campus visits and funding promotional videos If you are interested in being a part of the Kendall College of Arts and Sciences family, please visit our giving page. 2016-2017 Arts & Sciences Dean’s Circle Ellen and Steve Adelson Melinda and Mitch ’79 Adwon Joanie and Tom Atkinson Olivia Belknap ’96 Elizabeth Bender ’79 Harriet ‘69 and Bill ’67, ’69 Derrevere Jean Ann ’72 and Tom Fausser Linda Feagin ’66 Marilyn Girouard ’51 Kathleen Page and Michael Graves ’67, ‘70 Kellie ’72 and Fred Harlan Nancy and Jerry ’61 Henry Mary Ann Hille ’65 Robert Hogan Burt Holmes ’54 Jenk Jones Mary Lhevine ’82 and George Schnetzer Susan ’95 and Bob Mase Judith McCormack ’63, ’77 Teena and Paul Merrywell Paula ’61 and Malcolm Milsten Kalpana Misra and Murali Iyengar Valerie ’86 and Brad Naifeh Melinda Noel ’72 Vicki Parry ’61 Mindy ’80 and Jesse Pearson Kay and Tim ’78 Phoenix Peggy and Ron Predl Jean Roberts ’39 James Ruddle ’57, ’61 Frank Skipworth ’67, ’70 Betty ’83 and Kelly Swindle Norma and Steve ’68 Turnbo Julia and Bill ’86 Watson Martin Wing FOUNDATIONS Herbert and Roseline Gussman Foundation Pearl M. and Julia J.
