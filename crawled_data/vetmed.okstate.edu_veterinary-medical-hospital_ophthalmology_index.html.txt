Clients are welcome to call for an appointment or obtain a referral from their primary care veterinarian when seeking diagnostic testing and treatment options for an eye condition. Veterinarians are welcome to call anytime for a consultation or for immediate emergency referral of a patient. Patients with a systemic disease may also benefit from an ophthalmic exam as many diseases will affect the eyes. Identifying eye involvement with a systemic disease can help in the diagnosis of the disease and/or help prevent vision loss from the ocular involvement. Our goal is to provide exceptional service including caring for the needs of our patients and owners, taking time to effectively communicate with owners, and providing the best medical care for our patients. Dr. Margi Gilmour speaks about eye issues in dogs.
