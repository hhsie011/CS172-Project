Requirements The Ph.D. degree usually requires two years of course work, followed by supervised research and the completion of a doctoral dissertation. The first year involves core courses in: Microeconomics (Economics 2050, 2060) Macroeconomics (Economics 2070, 2080) Econometrics (Economics 2030, 2040) Two additional courses: One in mathematics (Economics 2010) One in applied economics analysis (Economics 2020) Students take written core examinations in microeconomics, macroeconomics, and econometrics at the end of the first year. Starting in the second year, each student chooses two fields of specialization, and takes an oral field exam. Each field comprises two advanced courses within an area. Beyond the fields, the student takes three additional advanced courses, for a total of seven. The rest of pre-dissertation requirements include a research paper turned in at the end of the third year and two successful seminar presentations. Handbook of the Graduate Program The detailed description of all requirements, along with guidelines for the student, can be found in The Handbook of the Graduate Program. View Handbook Dissertation The culmination of the Ph.D. program is the dissertation, which embodies the results of the student's original research. Work on the dissertation usually takes two-three years after completion of course work. Students working on dissertations participate actively in research workshops. After a faculty committee has approved the dissertation, the student takes a final oral examination on the subject of the dissertation.
