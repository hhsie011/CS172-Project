Application Review and Selection Process Once we receive your application, a Talent Acquisition Specialist in Human Resources will review it to determine if all required qualifications are met. If the application meets the stated minimum qualifications, it will be sent to the hiring department for further consideration. If the hiring department decides to request an interview, you will be contacted by a representative from either Human Resources or the hiring department to schedule a time. The typical selection process can take 8 to 10 weeks to complete. If you are a finalist for the position, you will receive a request for information to complete a background check and a minimum of three professional references. Please note that a request for references and background check does not constitute a job offer, as references and checks are conducted on most finalists. All applicants will be notified via email once a final decision is made. If you are selected to receive a job offer, you will be contacted directly by a Talent Acquisition Specialist.
