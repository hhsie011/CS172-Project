Studying history is important in order to fully understand the complexities of this modern globalized world. Students develop critical thinking skills, learn to write persuasively, and increase their cultural awareness. All of these skills are valued in any profession, so while students may decide to continue on to study history at a graduate level, our majors also enter other professional fields such as law, business, government and foreign service, journalism, and teaching.
