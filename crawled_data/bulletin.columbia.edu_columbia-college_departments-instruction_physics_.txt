For the major, the department offers a set of required courses well-suited to prepare students for the most rigorous course of graduate study. These can be supplemented by elective courses in a variety of advanced topics. Although most majors go on to graduate work in physics, the intellectual skills acquired in the study of physics can also provide the basis for work in a variety of other scientific and nonscientific areas. The physics concentration is for students who are interested in physics but are uncertain about graduate study in physics; for those who want to explore other subjects along with physics; for those who want to find a physics- or technology-related job after graduation; or for those who are considering a professional school such as law or medicine. The department helps concentrators custom design programs to ensure maximum flexibility in meeting students’ intellectual needs and career goals. With appropriate selection of courses, the concentrator can explore other subjects yet maintain the option of graduate study in physics. Research is an extremely important component of the Columbia physics experience. Because the department has a very small student-to-faculty ratio, essentially all physics majors and concentrators engage in experimental, computational, or theoretical research under the close supervision of a faculty member during part, if not all, of their time at Columbia. Registration for Introductory Courses The department offers a stand-alone one-semester course for nonscience majors, one introductory sequence in physics intended primarily for preprofessional students, and three introductory sequences in physics for engineering and physical science majors. Students are given credit for courses from only one of the different sequence groups. Mixing courses across the sequences is strongly discouraged; however, physics majors who begin their studies with PHYS UN1401 Introduction To Mechanics and Thermodynamics - PHYS UN1402 INTRO ELEC/MAGNETSM ＆ OPTCS should take PHYS UN2601 Physics, III: Classical and Quantum Waves as the third-semester course.

Students considering a physics major are strongly encouraged to begin one of these sequences in their first year. Laboratory Many of the introductory courses include a laboratory, as indicated. A $75 per term laboratory fee is charged for all 1000-level and 2000-level laboratories. Advanced Placement Students may earn a maximum of 6 credits in physics. The department grants 6 credits for a score of 4 or 5 on the AP Physics B exam, but the student is not entitled to any exemptions. The amount of credit is reduced to 3 if the student takes a 1000-level physics course. The department grants 3 credits for a score of 4 or 5 on the AP Physics C/MECH exam, but the student is not entitled to any exemptions. The amount of credit is reduced to 0 if the student takes PHYS UN1001, PHYS UN1201, PHYS UN1401 or PHYS UN1601. The department grants 3 credits for a score of 4 or 5 on the AP Physics C/E&M exam, but the student is not entitled to any exemptions.

Prospective physics majors are strongly encouraged to begin one of the introductory physics sequences in their first year. Majors should aim to acquire as extensive a background in mathematics as possible. The department considers laboratory experience to be an essential part of the physics curriculum. Majors and concentrators can gain such experience in the intermediate-level laboratories, the electronics laboratory, and through experimental research in faculty research groups. Grading A grade of C- or better must be obtained for a course to count toward the majors or the concentration. The grade of P is not acceptable, but a course that was taken P/D/F may be counted if and only if the P is uncovered by the Registrar's deadline.

CC/GS: Partial Fulfillment of Science Requirement Prerequisites: high school science and math. A review of the history and environmental consequences of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons of mass destruction (WMD); of how these weapons work, what they cost, how they have spread, how they might be used, how they are currently controlled by international treaties and domestic legislation, and what issues of policy and technology arise in current debates on WMD. What aspects of the manufacture of WMD are easily addressed, and what aspects are technically challenging? It may be expected that current events/headlines will be discussed in class. PHYS UN1111 Origins and Meaning. 3 points. This course is a one-semester journey across cosmological history, from the beginning of time to something akin to its end. We will explore the origin of inanimate physical structures (the cosmos as a whole, as well as that of galaxies, stars, planets, particles, atoms and complex molecules), the origin of life (replicating molecules, the first cells, as well as more complex life forms), the origin of mind (self-reflective conscious awareness) and the origin of culture (language, myth, religion, art, and science). We will then consider what science in particular tells us about the very far future, where we will encounter the likely demise of all complex matter, all life and all consciousness. In the face of such disintegration we will examine the nature of value and purpose. We will recognize that the deepest understanding of reality emerges from blending all of the accounts we discuss—from the reductionist to the humanist to the cosmological—and only through such amalgamation can we fully grasp the long-standing human search for meaning.

The “Quantum Simulation and Computing Lab” will give students hands-on experience in quantum optics, quantum simulation and quantum computing. The course combines lectures, tutorials, and two lab sections. In one lab section, students will do experiments with entangled photons. In the second lab section, students will program quantum computers and run algorithms on them using the IBM Qiskit platform. The course starts with a recap of linear algebra and quantum mechanics, followed by an introduction to quantum optics and quantum information. Two-level systems, Bloch sphere, quantum gates, and elementary quantum algorithms will be discussed. Quantum teleportation and quantum key distribution will be introduced as applications of entanglement. The lecture content will be directly applied in experiments with entangled photons. In the following, state-of-the-art quantum algorithms will be discussed, related to cutting-edge research results in quantum computing. This includes quantum Fourier transform, quantum simulation of the Schroedinger equation, and the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. During the course students will do one experimental project with entangled photons and one quantum programming project. Students will be guided to implement a quantum algorithm of their choice and run it on a quantum computer (IBM, IonQ, QuEra) Spring 2022: PHYS UN3084 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment PHYS 3084 001/18518 F 10:00am - 4:00pm 6th Flr Pupin Laboratories Sebastian Will 3.00 18/24 PHYS 3084 001/18518 T Th 1:10pm - 2:25pm 307 Uris Hall Sebastian Will 3.00 18/24 PHYS UN3500 Supervised Readings in Physics. 3 points.

Prerequisites: (PHYS GU4021 and PHYS GU4022) In this course, we will learn how the concepts of quantum mechanics are applied to real physical systems, and how they enable novel applications in quantum optics and quantum information. We will start with microscopic, elementary quantum systems – electrons, atoms, and ions - and understand how light interacts with atoms. Equipped with these foundations, we will discuss fundamental quantum applications, such as atomic clocks, laser cooling and ultracold quantum gases - a synthetic form of matter, cooled down to just a sliver above absolute zero temperature. This leads us to manybody quantum systems. We will introduce the quantum physics of insulating and metallic behavior, superfluidity and quantum magnetism – and demonstrate how the corresponding concepts apply both to real condensed matter systems and ultracold quantum gases. The course will conclude with a discussion of the basics of quantum information science - bringing us to the forefront of today’s quantum applications.
