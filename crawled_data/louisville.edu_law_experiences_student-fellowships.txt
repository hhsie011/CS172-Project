Human rights are defined broadly and inclusively, although historic advocacy has focused on health care, access to education, access to services (e.g., legal, medical, vocational) and language access. The HRAP provides sustained and funded opportunities for law students to gain subject matter expertise, leadership skills and community engagement in these areas. It works synergistically with community organizations and seeks to agitate for policies and frameworks that embrace and actualize human rights. The HRAP funds student fellows for each of their three years in law school and is co-directed by Brandeis School of Law Professors Enid Trucios-Haynes and Sam Marcosson. For more information on the HRAP, including how to apply, visit its website. Ordered Liberty Fellowship Launched in the 2019-2020 academic year, the Ordered Liberty Program's underlying concept is rooted in Aristotle and Cicero, and was given its fullest articulation in the 18th-Century writings of Irish statesman and political theorist Edmund Burke. Burke made clear that the good society depends not on utopian human constructs, but instead on the measured consideration of three time-tested virtues: justice, order, and freedom. The Ordered Liberty Program is committed to the enduring project of finding the right arrangement of justice, order, and freedom through the advanced study of five concepts: federalism, separation of powers, originalism, natural rights, and the common good. Ordered Liberty Fellows assist the program in a variety of ways: monthly gatherings for dinner and discussion of an assigned essay, one funded group trip per semester, and a research paper to be completed during Fellows’ upper-level years of study, for credit toward graduation. The Ordered Liberty Program is directed by Professor Luke Milligan. Resilience Justice Fellowships (Environmental Law) The Resilience Justice Project usually offers two to five funded fellowships per year. Student fellows work together on the Resilience Justice Project, including research, writing, community engagement, and policy and governance reforms. The students selected typically have interdisciplinary skills and a strong passion for social and environmental justice, and students may be expected to be taking coursework that already introduces them to the concepts and methods of resilience justice. The availability of fellowships depends on funding, and the term is typically one year. The Resilience Justice Project is directed by Professor Tony Arnold.
