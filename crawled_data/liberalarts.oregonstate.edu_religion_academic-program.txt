A major in Religious Studies will expose you to some of the most profound and beautiful creations of the human imagination, give you expertise in critical reasoning and close engagement with texts and ideas, give you skills to navigate the cultural complexity of our diverse society, and prepare you to be a participatory citizen of our interconnected global environment.
