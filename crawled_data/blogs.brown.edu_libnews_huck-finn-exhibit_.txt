While the nature of the criticism has changed, there has always been controversy surrounding the book. This exhibit offers a look at how that criticism has changed from publication through the present. Dates: October 16 – December 18, 2015 Time: Rockefeller Library Hours Location: Lobby Cases, Rockefeller Library, 10 Prospect Street, Providence This entry was posted in Exhibits & Events by Jennifer Braga.
