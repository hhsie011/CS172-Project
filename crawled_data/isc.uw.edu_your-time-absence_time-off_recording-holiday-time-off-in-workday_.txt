For example, if you work Monday through Friday and the holiday falls on a Friday, you will need to log into Workday and record that you are taking the holiday off. If you do not record the holiday as Holiday Taken Time Off, Workday will assume you worked on the holiday and will credit you Holiday Credit. The requirement to record Holiday Taken Time Off applies to staff and librarians, with the exception of Department of Intercollegiate Athletics (ICA) coaches and academic personnel (faculty, residents, fellows and other academic staff) who do not need to track time off for holidays in Workday. Campus Staff and Librarians If you are taking the day off on a UW holiday: Sign into Workday and follow the steps in the Holiday Taken Time Off Quick Guide (PDF). Your time off request will automatically be approved. Plan Ahead! To avoid having to log in each holiday, you can record your intention to take the day off for upcoming UW holidays. To do so, simply repeat steps 3 and 4 of the Holiday Taken Time Off Quick Guide (PDF). If you are working on a UW holiday: You don’t need to take any action. You will accrue Holiday Credit for working on the UW holiday. The Holiday Credit can be used for time off at a later date. Medical Centers Employees Report your holiday hours time off in Kronos. If you do not enter holiday time off, you will accrue Holiday Credit for working on a UW holiday. Any Holiday Credit that is not used will be paid out annually in the pay period ending June 30. Related Links To determine which days are considered holidays, refer to the UW Holiday Calendar. For more information about the UW’s holiday policy, visit UWHR’s Holidays page.
