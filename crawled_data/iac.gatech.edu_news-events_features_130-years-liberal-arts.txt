From this crossroads, faculty and students consider the implications of policies and actions in the lives of human beings and create sustainable solutions for a better world.  “We are meeting the world, belly-to-belly, face-to-face, head-on, prepared to go forward with the kinds of things that humanists and social scientists ought to be doing in the world,” Dean Jacqueline Royster said.
