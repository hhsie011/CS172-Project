These arts attest to connections between far-flung global networks, linking cities on trade routes in sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian Ocean. The talk will feature images of large-scale frescoes and mosaics with luxury goods, metalwork, jewelry, panel paintings, and illuminated manuscripts, dating from the late antique to the present. It will focus on several interconnected themes central to the visual arts of the region: trade, monasticism, imperial and episcopal authority, as well as diverse Christianities and ethnicities. The exhibition asks: how can we reframe the narrative of art produced by Christian communities in Africa, and to what extent does this reframing disrupt art historical categories?
