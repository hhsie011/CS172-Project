F-1, F-2, and J-1 students enrolling in classes receive the UnitedHealthcare StudentResources insurance coverage automatically, regardless of their course load. The charge for insurance is added to the student tuition and fees bill. Please reference the Insurance Costs page for information on the fees associated with this insurance plan. “NEW” Activation Process: After an F-1, F-2, and J-1 student enrolls in classes, they can now submit an activation request to have their insurance activated prior to the semester beginning and by the UnitedHealthcare StudentResources insurance beginning coverage date. Information about early activation can be found on the “New” Early Activation Process page. If a student does not submit an activation request, their insurance plan will automatically be activated after the insurance waiver process has been completed. The anticipated automatic activation date for summer 2022 is June 25, 2022. Coverage dates for the summer 2022 health insurance plans are June 1, 2022 - July 31, 2022. Students can go to Watkins Health Services for medical treatment prior to their insurance plan being activated. NOTE: Because all J-1 Visitors are required to have health insurance for themselves and their J-2 dependents for the duration of their stay, regardless of enrollment, J-2’s who enroll in KU classes are not automatically billed for the insurance. Contact issinsurance@ku.edu to sign up for the KU UHC insurance.

Additional details found here. Please note, this is not the Kansas Board of Regents selected company. Electronic Waiver Process Students who have an alternative insurance plan, may request a waiver of the KU plan, as long as their insurance meets or exceeds the Kansas Board of Regents requirements. To receive a waiver, students must complete the online waiver process on or before the deadline, for a given term. If an alternative plan meets the KBOR requirements, the financial charge for the plan will be removed from the student’s account (Student Accounts & Receivables). The intent of these insurance requirements is for all international students to have excellent, continuous insurance coverage while studying at the University of Kansas. If you have further questions, please contact the ISS Insurance Team at issinsurance@ku.edu.
