It maximizes Brown’s significant and distinctive assets—outstanding core academic departments, networks of highly accomplished artists and a history of artistic experimentation—to foster an environment where boundary-pushing artists learn from and inform scholars and students across the disciplines. “ Exposure to the arts helps people reflect not only on themselves but also on the wider world. The process of making art is like having an encounter with the unknown. It teaches people to never stop thinking like a beginner and asking those fundamental questions. At the BAI we invite and support artists and arts-scholars to practice among us, work with students, and show us our world. ” Thalia Field Adele Kellenberg Seaver Professor of Creative Writing and Faculty Director, BAI With critical investments, the BAI will enrich the talent, education, and research essential to transform the way students learn the arts. The BAI will also strengthen Brown’s arts infrastructure by augmenting existing labs, studios, galleries and production spaces. And The Lindemann Performing Arts Center will expand the possibilities for the creation and staging of new works by students, fellows, faculty, and community and global partners. Support the Brown Arts Institute. Help us cultivate creativity on College Hill.
