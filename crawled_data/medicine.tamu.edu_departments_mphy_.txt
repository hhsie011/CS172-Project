Zawieja, PhD Regents Professor Director of Division of Lymphatic Biology 1342 Medical Education and Research Building 2 Bryan, TX 77807 dcz@tamu.edu About Medical Physiology The Department of Medical Physiology explores the functions of the human body in health and disease. The department is headquartered in the Medical Research and Education Building at the Bryan campus of the Texas A&M Health Science Center. The teaching, research and service missions of the department are supported by the principal faculty members. Our research focuses on the cardiovascular system with clusters of expertise in cardiac biology, vascular biology, lymphatic biology, physiological imaging, and computational biology. Funding for this research is provided by the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, NASA, American Heart Association, and other foundations. The faculty is committed to bridging the gap between basic and clinical research through translational studies that probe human pathobiology and seek to develop therapeutic countermeasures for these abnormal conditions. Clinical disorders of interest to our faculty include: heart failure, arterial hypertension, ischemia, inflammation, edema, and diabetes. The faculty of the department teaches and trains medical students, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. PhD and MD/PhD training within the College of Medicine are facilitated by a multidisciplinary Medical Science Graduate Program that provides several tracks to accommodate student research interests, including Cardiovascular Science Track. The high level of research and training interactions between faculty members is a strength of the department. Courses MPHY graduate course descriptions can be viewed through the Texas A&M Course Catalog. Joint Research The research interests of the Medical Physiology faculty range from molecular and cell biology to tissues, organs, entire organ systems and organisms. All of our faculty members participate in thematic centers, institutes or interdisciplinary faculties within the Texas A&M University Health Science Center and/or Texas A&M University, including: Cardiovascular Research Institute (CVRI) Center for Translational Environmental Health Research (CTEHR) DeBakey Institute for Comparative Cardiovascular Science & Biomedical Devices Department of Genetics Faculty Huffines Institute for Sports Medicine & Human Performance Interdisciplinary Faculty of Toxicology (IFT) Ophthalmic Vascular Research Program (OVRP) Facebook Twitter Instagram Linked in RSS YouTube Back to top Institution Health Science Center Dentistry Medicine Nursing Pharmacy Public Health Information Calendars Contact Us Diversity Emergency Information Emergency Plans Maps & Parking Press & Media Title IX Clery Annual Reports Resources Directory Facilities Work Request Howdy Portal Information Technology Intranet Libraries Mental Health Resources Policies Webmail Texas A&M University · Texas A&M University System · State of Texas · Open Records · Risk, Fraud & Misconduct Hotline · State Link Policy · Equal Opportunity / Nondiscrimination · Employment · Texas Veterans Portal · Security · Site Policies · Accessibility
