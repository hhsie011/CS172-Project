This includes paying your application fee and electronically signing your housing contract. Once logged in, click on the Housing Application from the menu across the top.

All LLC students should choose Halls & Pay by Semester Apts – August 20XX – May 20XX. Click Save & Continue. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete your Housing Application. At the end of Phase I on the Housing Application you have the opportunity to request more information be emailed to you on any LLC(s) you express interest in.

Click Save & Continue. The next page, Desired LLC(s), will invite you to preference one to three Living Learning Community(s). Click Save & Continue. Some LLCs will have a supplemental application, or more steps, to fully complete their application. Check each of the individual LLC websites you are applying for to learn if this is applicable to you. Once you have completed Phase II of the Housing Application, you should receive an email confirmation within 10 days detailing what LLC you have gained membership to along with what building you can expect to be assigned a room.
