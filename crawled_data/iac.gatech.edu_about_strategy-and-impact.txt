Bringing with her many years of service across multiple institutions and disciplines, experience as the former chair of the School of Public Policy, and a sense of optimism for the College’s role in the new strategic vision for Georgia Tech, the Dean engaged Georgia Tech Strategic Consulting (GTSC) to coordinate and facilitate a strategic planning process for the College. The planning process would be anchored in a study, similar to the work of National Academies studies, researching the following foundational question: “What should be the purpose and potential of a liberal arts college at a technology-centered university in the 21st century?” Over the course of the 2020 –2021 academic year, a study committee will conduct research and develop a set of conclusions and recommendations about Ivan Allen College’s offerings to faculty, students and staff, its role at Georgia Tech, and its contributions to the liberal arts. The culmination of the committee’s work will be a final report that will be shared with the IAC community and used as an input for the College’s strategic planning process. The more traditional development of the strategic plan –mission, vision, goals, objectives, and metrics–will begin immediately after the delivery of the study report, and will be finalized by the end of the Fall 2021 semester.
