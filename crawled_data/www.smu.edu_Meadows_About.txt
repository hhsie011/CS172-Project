Meadows, the Meadows School of the Arts is one of the foremost arts education institutions in the United States. The Meadows School offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in an unusual mix of the arts—visual (art, art history and creative computation), performing (dance, music and theatre) and communications (advertising; film and media arts; corporate communication and public affairs; and journalism)—as well as a preeminent program in arts management and arts entrepreneurship. The goal of the Meadows School, as a comprehensive educational institution, is to prepare students to meet the demands of professional careers. The school is a leader in developing innovative outreach and community engagement programs, challenging its students to make a difference locally and globally by developing connections between art, entrepreneurship and change. Meadows is also a convener for the arts in North Texas, serving as a catalyst for new collaborations and providing critical industry research.
