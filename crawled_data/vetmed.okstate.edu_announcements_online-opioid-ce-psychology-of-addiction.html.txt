For Oklahoma licensees, this course satisfies the full two- hour requirement for the review of CDS laws and/or the Oklahoma Veterinary Practice Act including the one-hour requirement for DEA registrants. Registration is $40. In this course, participants will explore research on the development and patterns of addiction; review signs and symptoms of addiction; identify negative systemic impacts of addiction; explore their role in responding to addiction within themselves and others; and learn appropriate responses to signs of addiction within themselves and others. A compelling personal story of addiction from an Oklahoma veterinarian is included in the curriculum. The Psychology of Addiction is presented by Dr. Jeremiah Grissett, a licensed marriage and family therapist serving as counselor and wellness coordinator at the Oklahoma State University College of Veterinary Medicine. In this role, he provides counseling services for veterinary and graduate students and serves on several committees promoting health and wellness for students, faculty, and staff. The course takes approximately two hours to complete. While the course can be completed at participants’ own pace, it must be completed by June 30 for 2022 license renewal. This course is offered for a reduced rate due to funding support from the Oklahoma Veterinary Board.
