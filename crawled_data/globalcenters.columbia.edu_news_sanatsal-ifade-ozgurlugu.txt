Yazan: Fisun Yalçınkaya September 30, 2017 Columbia Global Centers Istanbul, İsveç Konsolosluğu ve DEPO işbirliğiyle sanatta sansür konusunu ulus ötesi perspektifte tartışmak amacıyla önceki akşam ‘Tartışmalı Alanlarda Sanatsal İfade’ isimli bir panel düzenledi. Panelde sanatsal ifade özgürlüğü önündeki engeller ve hak ihlallerine karşı mücadele biçimleri konuşuldu. Studio-X’te Asena Günal’ın moderatörlüğünde gerçekleşen panelde ilk olarak Columbia Universitesi Küresel İlişkiler Danışmanı, SIPA, Asia Society Fahri Başkanı Vishakha Desai söz aldı. Desai tüm dünyadan ve farklı tarihlerden sanatsal ifadenin engellenmesi hakkında müzelerden kaldırılan eserler üzerine örneklere yer vererek konuştu. Sonrasında panelde Eski Uluslararası PEN Direktörü, Sanatsal İfade Özgürlüğü Alanında Bağımsız Danışman Sara Whyatt söz aldı. Whyatt, tüm dünyada kayda geçmiş binlerce sansür vakası olduğunu sanatsal ifade özgürlüğünün kısıtlanması sorununun uzun zamandır var olduğunu ancak STK’larla birlikte daha çok gündeme geldiğini söyledi. Whyatt sanatsal özgürlüğün insani bir hak olduğuna uluslararası mekanizmaların devreye sokulmasına ihtiyaç olduğuna dikkat çekti. Freemuse Kurucu Ortağı ve Eski Direktörü Ole Reitov ise medyanın ve iletişim araçlarının rolüne değinerek kim olduğumuzu ve yerimizi tanımlamamızın sanatsal özgürlük savunması konusundaki önemini anlattı.
