OSU supports an online degree in WGSS. The Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies major represents multidisciplinary approaches to the study of gender and sexuality, particularly as they intersect with race, ethnicity, class, culture, nation, and ability. The curriculum incorporates feminist social justice theory and research to better understand differences in power and privilege and to contribute to practices that help transform our world. Many classes incorporate a social activism component, and students are encouraged to consider the ways knowledge and activist engagements help promote social justice in local and global communities. WGSS Major (48 credits) A total of 48 credits is required for the major: 27 credits of required Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies core courses, and 21 credits of elective courses. Electives may include courses taught in Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies as well as courses that are taught in other academic units that are approved as Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Program courses in consultation with your WGSS advisor. These courses have a focus on gender, sexuality, and/or women's issues. No more than 9 credits of these Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Program courses may be used toward the major. For the on-campus major, all required course work must be taken on campus and no more than 6 credits of online elective course work can be used toward the major. With the exception of the Writing Intensive Curriculum (WIC), courses used to satisfy requirements for the major may not be used to meet baccalaureate or liberal arts core requirements.

As land acknowledgments become more common, Indigenous people grapple with next steps - https://www.opb.org/article/2021/12/08/as-land-acknowledgments-become-more-common-indigenous-people-grapple-with-next-steps/: December 09, 2021 Dr. Luhui Whitebear on OPB's Think Out Loud More and more organizations, companies and institutions are incorporating land acknowledgments into their work. These statements are intended to acknowledge and show respect to the Indigenous people who have lived on the land for millennia. Luhui Whitebear, assistant professor in the Oregon State University School of Language, Culture, & Society, says land acknowledgments should be the beginning of an organization’s work with tribes, not the end. Whitebear helped to craft OSU’s land acknowledgment. We hear from her and Rachel Black Elk, junior instructor for the Indigenous Nations Studies program at Portland State University.
