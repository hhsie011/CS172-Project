In addition to other teaching sites in New England, students complete clinical clerkships in Dartmouth-affiliated teaching hospitals in Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, and Maine. Fellowships from the Dartmouth International Health Group and from the medical school's newly established Center for Health Equity help Geisel medical students to explore health care opportunities—and needs—throughout the world. Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center is a national leader in patient-centered health care and building a sustainable health system. Founded in 1893, the system includes New Hampshire's only Level 1 trauma center and its only air ambulance service, as well as the Dartmouth Cancer Center, one of only 41 National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers in the nation, and the Children's Hospital at Dartmouth Hitchcock, the state's only Children's Hospital Association-approved, comprehensive, full-service children's hospital. As an academic medical center, Dartmouth Hitchcock provides access to nearly 1,000 primary care doctors and specialists in almost every area of medicine. The VA Medical Center - White River Junction The Veterans Affairs Medical Center, located 15 minutes from the medical school's campus, is consistently rated as one of the best VA hospitals in the country. The WRJ VA Medical Center received the 2010 Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert W. Carey Organizational Excellence Award—the VA's highest recognition of quality—for the ninth consecutive year. The VA Medical Center's outstanding clinical and research environment provides a robust experience for the hundreds of Geisel medical students and residents training there each year. The VAMC includes the National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, the VA Outcomes Group (a division of Geisel's Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice), and the Yasinski Research Building, which houses labs that receive over $9 million in annual research support. California Pacific Medical Center The Geisel School of Medicine has a strong educational affiliation with California Pacific Medical Center, one of the largest private, not-for-profit, academic medical centers in California. Also one of San Francisco's foremost teaching hospitals, CPMC provides Geisel third- and fourth-year students the opportunity for excellent clinical training experiences in a large, urban academic medical center. Geisel students training at CPMC experience the practice of medicine within diverse patient populations, as they see patients with a great range of medical diagnoses, backgrounds, cultures, and countries of origin. Comprised of four campuses, CPMC is a major metropolitan health system with outstanding residency and teaching programs. Indian Health Service Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine and the Indian Health Service have a long, rich history of partnership in medical education, and a shared commitment to improving lives in underserved communities. For many years, the medical school has sent students to clerkship sites at Indian Health Service medical centers and facilities in Fort Defiance and Tuba City, Arizona, and in Shiprock, New Mexico. In 2012, Dartmouth and the IHS signed a new agreement to increase recruiting and training of health care professionals from the Native community at Dartmouth; and providing educational opportunities for doctors and nurses working at the IHS. Dr. Susan Karol, the IHS chief medical officer, is a 1979 Dartmouth graduate. In addition to the third- and fourth-year students training at IHS clinical sites, a group of first-year Geisel students take part in an annual clinical and community service trip each Spring to Indian Health Service clinics and five Ojibwe Indian reservations in northern Minnesota.
