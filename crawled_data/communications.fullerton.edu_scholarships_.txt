Disclaimer: Federal regulations require students to notify the Office of Financial Aid of any scholarships and/or stipends they are receiving, which includes awards issued by academic departments and those paid directly to the student. Upon notification, all financial aid funds - this includes scholarships/stipends - must be considered when determining your eligibility for all other financial aid award(s). Speak with a financial aid counselor to discuss the impact on your financial aid award package. This site is maintained by College of Communications.
