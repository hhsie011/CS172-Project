Students benefit from a low faculty-to-student ratio and the faculty's integrated approach to the study of the planning, design, and management of the built environment and its effects on those using it. The M.A. degree is a two-year, post-professional degree program intended for students with an undergraduate degree in interior design, architecture, or product design who want to do advanced study and research program in interior design. The program culminates in a formal research thesis in which students are encouraged to systemically develop and test research based design solutions, theories, and methods. For more information, check the department web site. Research opportunities: Much of the research occurs in the field. The department also has a computer-aided design and facility management lab; human factors and ergonomics research labs; an art and environmental design gallery; and a wood workshop.

Prospective graduate students will apply for admission to the Field of Design and Environmental Analysis under their desired concentration. All applicants must present scores from the Graduate Record Examinations (GREs), including the writing evaluation now integrated in the GRE. Students holding a master's degree may use previous examination scores to satisfy this requirement. Students whose native language is not English must present scores for the TOEFL English language examination, if they have not studied at least two years or received a degree in a country where English is the native language (see Graduate School English language proficiency requirement for more information). Applications will be reviewed by the members of the graduate field. Only students with outstanding records will be admitted to the program. Outstanding students with a B.S. or B. A. degree in human factors, psychology, facility planning and management or related areas such as industrial design, interior design or architecture, engineering, or anthropology may be admitted into the Ph.D. program depending on the relevance of their background to the research specialty they will pursue. Since Human Behavior and Design is a highly interdisciplinary field, decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
