Citizens mobilize all over France in what is the the beginning of the Yellow Vest movement. In Chartres, a group of men and women gather everyday. Among them are Agnès, Benoît, Nathalie, et Allan, who are fully committed to this collective struggle. Like many in France, they are discovering that they too have a voice that demands to be heard. This free screening with English Subtitles will be followed by a Q&A, in English, with the film's Director, Emmanuel Gras and moderated by Jake Lamar. This event is co-organized with the Columbia Institute for Ideas and Imagination and Lost in Frenchlation. Emmanuel Gras is a French director who graduated in 2000 from the ENS Louis Lumière. His social and poetic approach abandons the conventions of documentary language for a free, visual and musical narrative, playing with reality and the powers of cinema. His first feature film was presented by ACID in Cannes in 2011 and nominated for the Césars for Best Documentary. He won the Grand Prix at the Semaine de la Critique in 2017 with his third film, Makala. Jake Lamar was born in 1961 and grew up in the Bronx, New York. After graduating from Harvard University, he spent six years writing for Time magazine. He has lived in Paris since 1993 and teaches creative writing at one of France's top universities, Sciences Po. He is the author of a memoir, seven novels, numerous essays, reviews and short stories, and a play. His most recent work, Viper's Dream, is both a crime novel and a radio drama, set in the jazz world of Harlem between 1936 and 1961. He is a recipient of the Lyndhurst Prize (for his first book, Bourgeois Blues), a prestigious Centre National du Livre grant (for his novel Postérité), France’s Grand Prize for best foreign thriller (for his novel The Last Integrationist), and a Beaumarchais fellowship for his play Brothers in Exile. He is currently working on a memoir about his life in Paris.
