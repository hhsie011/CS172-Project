Through our core courses, we develop students into leaders with an entrepreneurial mindset. They learn an invaluable set of skills essential to recognizing opportunities and seizing them. We teach students to connect the dots; to look at business challenges from across disciplines, with an integrated perspective. And we provide the guidance and opportunity for them to evolve as effective leaders, so they will not only stand out in the first year after graduation, but in the decades beyond as they move further and further ahead in their careers.
