Typically, electronic transcripts are processed within a few hours, as long as you have no holds on your records. These requests can be completed outside of business hours and are not affected by university closures. If there is a delay in your electronic transcript request, please call 405-945-3291. If you make the request in person, a printed transcript can typically be issued at that time as long as you have no holds on your records. For printed transcript requests made online, by mail or fax, we often can mail transcripts the same day or next business day, depending on the time of receipt. Please allow 24-48 hours for processing at the beginning and end of the semester during our peak registration periods. Additional circumstances that can delay processing include the posting of current semester grades, anticipated changes to your record such as grade changes or incompletes, final degree/graduation processing, etc. Printed transcript requests will not be processed during university holidays and closures Why can’t I request a transcript by phone or receive my transcript by fax or email? The Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law that protects students’ educational records. Under this law, educational records can only be released to the student. A signature or photo ID is required to release or access any education record in order to protect students’ privacy and security of records. Holds Various holds (academic, financial, etc.) may prevent OSU-OKC from releasing your official transcript. Please be sure you have taken care of any outstanding business before requesting an official transcript.
