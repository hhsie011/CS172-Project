Student Organizations On Campus There are more than 500 clubs and organizations that highlight everything from cultural diversity and dance to technology, sports, sustainability, religion, and more. Find a club that suits you or start your own from the ground up. Creative Inquiry Creative inquiry programs also encourage you to take on a problem you want to solve, either on campus or in your community, and to work with a faculty member to build a solution while earning course credit. You can join an existing project or work with a faculty member to create your own. In the Community There are several organizations in the surrounding community – big and small – that need volunteers.
