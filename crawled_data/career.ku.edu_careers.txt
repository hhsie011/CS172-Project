Each career links to a brief description of the career and also includes a few sample majors that could help you gain skills that may be beneficial in pursuing that career, the typical degree level required, and associated interest areas. By utilizing the major and interest area links, you can further explore additional related careers and majors. Featured Resources Occupational Outlook Handbook Back to Explore Careers, Interests, and Majors Careers and Majors Remember, many careers do not require a specific major. Rather, employers are often more concerned about the experiences you have had and the skills, interests, abilities, and strengths you have developed through your experiences. No matter the major you choose, it is important to participate in experiential learning opportunities to supplement your education to help make you more marketable to employers. Careers Requiring a Graduate Degree Additionally, for those careers that require a specific graduate level degree, keep in mind your undergraduate major does not necessarily have to align with the required graduate program. For example, you may have an undergraduate degree in sociology, attend graduate school and earn your PhD in psychology, and become a clinical psychologist. Start Exploring!
