Our faculty does more than teach. As a community of world-renowned scholars, they inform, challenge and transform academia. When you enter their classrooms, you enter into a partnership of learning that opens up whole new vistas of knowledge and lifelong learning. Almost all SMU faculty members hold doctorate degrees or the highest degrees in their fields. That means the people teaching your classes and leading your classroom discussions also are breaking new ground in their fields. We have science and engineering professors who hold patents on innovations that are making an impact on health care and technology. We have business and communications professors who are active consultants and entrepreneurs. We have arts faculty who compose, choreograph and create. And with our small class sizes, you'll get to know these groundbreakers personally, both inside the classroom and individually as your advisors and mentors.
