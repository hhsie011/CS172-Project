Her father, Eugene T. Moore, was a 1949 graduate of Clemson and a highly respected teacher, coach and principal in Florence County, South Carolina. In his honor, Moore and her husband, Richard Rainwater, gave a $10 million endowed gift to Clemson's educational leadership and teacher education efforts. That gift led to the creation of the Eugene T. Moore School of Education, home to renowned classroom and clinical training for pre-service teachers, professional mentoring of early-career teachers, and cutting-edge continuing education for in-service teachers. The Moore family's support and friendship have imprinted a legacy on the College of Education through a shared commitment to excellence. From the Moore Family Eugene T. Moore Welcome to the College of Education, home of the Eugene T. Moore School of Education. The Eugene T. Moore School of Education houses nationally renowned classroom and clinical training for pre-service teachers, professional mentoring of early-career teachers, and cutting-edge continuing education for in-service teachers. All of these efforts are borne out of our collective commitment to the transformation of South Carolina and to leading educational innovation. Clemson University is changing the way teachers and school leaders are taught. Faculty are engaged in groundbreaking professional preparation and research in teaching, educational administration and counseling. Because our family believes in the importance of education, we are pleased that our endowment honors my father, Eugene T. Moore. Our family has a long history with Clemson University. My father is a 1949 graduate of Clemson and had a distinguished career as a teacher, coach and principal in Lake City, S.C. Even if he were not my father, I would find it appropriate to see his name attached to a school of education where many of the nation’s future teachers and principals will launch their careers. He has played an important role in the lives of many young people in this state. We are proud to be part of the Clemson family – a strong network of alumni, colleagues, friends and other professionals. The College of Education has the largest four-year undergraduate teacher education program in South Carolina and offers areas of graduate study at the master’s and doctoral levels. It is inspiring to see so many Clemson graduates who have excelled as educational administrators, teachers and counselors. The Moore-Rainwater endowment was established to create endowed professorships in educational leadership and teacher education and to support future programs designed to prepare professionals for careers in education. If you are interested in a career in education, there is no better place to prepare than the College of Education. It is clear that education is central to the economic development and future of our society. The College of Education is making rapid progress in becoming a first-class school. It is a place where there is a strong commitment to educating all children in this country at the highest levels. We are proud to be a part of such a great university family. Sincerely, Darla Moore Inaugural Distinguished Friend of the College In September 2019, Darla Moore was named the first recipient of the College of Education's Distinguished Friend of the College award, given to honor an individual, partner or program who has provided support over time to benefit the College of Education. She was given the award for her efforts to make a significant difference in education and support the vision and goals of the College of Education. The College recognized Moore with the award at its Annual Awards Celebration, which also honored faculty members for their achievements in research, teaching and service. “ “Anyone’s legacy is the people they leave behind. It’s a legacy of opportunity and excellence that the Clemson College of Education can provide for these young people. There is no greater legacy than those we leave behind who are better prepared and better able to take advantage of opportunities.” Darla Moore Principal Donor College of Education Watch Board of Trustees Video Featuring Darla Moore College of Education "Best In Class" Copyright © Clemson University College of Education "Best In Class" | 101 Gantt Circle 864-656-7656 | Email Us | Website Updates intro-arrow Engage With Us Through Facebook Twitter Instagram Clemson University Facebook Instagram Twitter Linkedin Youtube Tiktok Policy/Terms of Use Web Accessibility Ethics/Safety Hotline Privacy Policy Copyright © 2022 Clemson University • Clemson, South Carolina 29634 Clemson University Facebook Instagram Twitter Linkedin Youtube Tiktok Resources A-Z Index Campus Map CU Safety Directory Webcams Apply to Clemson
