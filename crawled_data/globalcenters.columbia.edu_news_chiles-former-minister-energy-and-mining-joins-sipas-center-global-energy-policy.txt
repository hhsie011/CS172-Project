Energy and Mining Joins SIPA’S Center on Global Energy Policy Santiago Chile’s Former Minister of Energy and Mining Joins SIPA’S Center on Global Energy Policy “Climate change is the biggest challenge of our generation.” Juan Carlos Jobet March 18, 2022 Juan Carlos Jobet, Chile’s former Minister of Energy and Mining, is joining Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy as a Distinguished Visiting Fellow to focus on the development of the green hydrogen industry, the accelerated phase out of coal plants, and the role that critical metals and minerals will play in the energy transition. “Climate change is the biggest challenge of our generation,” said Jobet. “The current energy crisis demonstrates the speed with which we must accelerate the clean energy transition. This will bring enormous opportunities for the countries, communities, and companies that have the vision and determination to transform the ways we produce and consume energy. I can think of no better place than CGEP to make a contribution to those transformations.” As Minister of Energy and Mining, Jobet led Chile’s energy transition which included reaching a set of goals within the country’s carbon neutrality plan for the energy sector. Additionally, he developed the country’s first comprehensive mining policy, establishing a vision for a sustainable, competitive, and green mining, while also holding leadership roles in international organizations and initiatives, including as chair of the Clean Energy Ministerial and Mission Innovation 2021, as well as co-chair of the Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition. “Juan Carlos' experience in government is critical to crafting the near- and short-term policy solutions needed to address the climate crisis and energy transition,” said Jason Bordoff, CGEP director. “I’m excited to have him on our team, his leadership will help guide much of our work in these areas.” Throughout his career, Jobet has held several positions in both the public and private sector. He was Undersecretary of Housing and Minister of Labor & Social Security during Sebastián Piñera’s first administration. He has also worked in investment banking and held several positions in industries including finance, real estate, forestry, fintech, infrastructure, and waste management. On Wednesday March 30, Jobet will take part in the event “Russia-Ukraine Crisis: Implications for Latin America’s Energy Sector,” a conversation on what Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will mean for Latin America’s energy transition and how the region will be impacted by high energy prices. Register for the event here.
