Navigating funding announcements and identifying those opportunities which best match science and scientist can be challenging. While the Office of Research Administration generally does not search for funding opportunities for individual faculty members, this section of our website provides information on internal and external funding sources. Office of the Vice Provost for Research/Internal UM Funding Internal Awards are also available from the University of Miami for faculty on all campuses. Questions related to Internal/UM Funding should be directed to the Office of the Vice Provost for Research.
