SEAS-Affiliated Student Organizations are Harvard College student organizations registered through the Harvard College Student Engagement Office. Each undergraduate group abides by the policies and procedures of Harvard College and are listed on The Hub. Each SEAS-Affiliated Student Organization has significant numbers of SEAS pre-concentrators and current concentrators as a part of their membership, are guided by SEAS faculty and staff as their advisors, and they form an integral part of the SEAS learning community. SEAS-affiliated student organizations are critical to the overall growth of our concentrators as engineering and applied science professionals. These organizations enable our students to pursue passion projects and events in areas of interest that are complementary to the current formal academic curriculum. These organizations provide students excellent opportunities to exercise technical leadership skills and build up their professional portfolios.
