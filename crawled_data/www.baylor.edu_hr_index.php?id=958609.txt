Maximum savers may be interested in deferring part of their salary, up to the IRS limit, into the 457(b) plan on a pre-tax basis. The basic contribution limit is determined by the IRS. This non-governmental plan does not offer an over age 50 catch-up provision. Vestiture in the 457(b) occurs when the employee leaves employment with Baylor University. The Baylor 457(b) Plan allows faculty and staff to postpone receipt of a portion of current income, which results in pre-tax retirement deferrals. These tax deferred dollars may be invested with TIAA.
