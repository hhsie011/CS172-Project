It is a collaboration among researchers and an Earth Science educator at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University; technology integration specialists from Colégio Bandeirantes, São Paulo, Brasil; and classroom teachers from New York, New Jersey, and elsewhere. E2C centers around “Saturday Workshops for Educators” held at Columbia's Lamont Campus in Palisades N.Y. One key feature to E2C is involvement of LDEO scientists. Their availability through workshops, web site postings, and e-mail allow teachers and students access to cutting-edge research which can be used to develop learning activities directly linked to “real-world problems,” and provide scientists with an effective format to disseminate their discoveries more broadly. Since 1998, we have provided more than 120 Workshops featuring over 80 LDEO scientists. To obtain the zoom access link, please email Michael Passow at [email protected] at least a day in advance. There is no charge. A certificate of participation for 1.5 hr of professoional development will be provided.
