ACE participants also receive access to additional exam review sessions, individual tutoring, and other study resources. We accept applications from all students who believe they may benefit from participating in small active-learning sessions led by a highly trained graduate student. ACE Course List Application Process Meet Your ACE CAs Learn About the ACE Team Expectations & Requirements Students accepted to ACE are required to attend the scheduled course lectures for either CME, CS, or Math, and the graduate student-led ACE section for the course. Please note that ACE sections are scheduled so that they do not conflict with the course lecture time. Concurrent enrollment is required. In order to receive credit for the ACE course, the core course must be passed and completed. Application Process & Courses There are three different ACE applications for the Spring quarter, each managed by their respective department.
