Types of bars include financial, nonfinancial and advising. If you have any bars, they will appear on your Registration Information Sheet and in your Important Information on MyUT. Financial bars, in most cases, may be cleared on your What I Owe page or paid in cash or by check at the Cashier’s Office in Main Building (MAI) Room 8. Nonfinancial bars must be resolved in person at the administrative office that imposed it. Advising bars are placed when you have not sought advising required by your major or department. Consult your academic advisor to check your major or department’s advising requirements. Still Need Help? We’re here for you.
