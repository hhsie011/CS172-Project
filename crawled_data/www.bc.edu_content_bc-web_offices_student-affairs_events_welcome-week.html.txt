Boston College Prerequisites As an incoming Boston College student we want you and your classmates to have a healthy social, academic, and residential experience at Boston College. All first year students will be asked to complete four required video modules prior to arriving on campus in August. These include the following: AlcoholEdu (First-Year Students Only) Whether you drink or not, this course will empower you to make well-informed decisions about alcohol and help you to reflect on and consider college drinking related issues. Part I of the course takes about two hours to complete. 45 days after completing AlcoholEdu Part I, you will receive an email to complete Part II, which takes about 15 minutes. DiversityEdu This online course seeks to promote diversity and inclusion by teaching students skills in addressing unconscious biases and stereotypical thinking. This module will provide the opportunity to think critically about your own perspective, as well as the perspective of others. DiversityEdu aims to create a foundation of shared ideas and language that will enhance further conversations around diversity, identity, and inclusion during your time at Boston College and beyond.In total it should take approximately one hour to complete. Your participation in the course will be recorded once you have passed the embedded quiz and completed the entire module. Mental Well-Being This course equips students with essential skills and information to navigate the stressors and emotional challenges associated with college life. The 45-minute module helps learners practice self-care strategies, recognize when they or their peers are in distress, and take action to find additional support. Sexual Assault Prevention for Undergraduates This online interactive course provides information about the important issue of sexual violence. It includes information about relationships and consent, as well as information on sexual assault and prevention.
