Breadcrumb Home Volunteer Volunteer Opportunities Brown Annual Fund Volunteers Sub Navigation In This Section Brown Annual Fund Executive Committee Brown Annual Fund Leadership Council Students Young Alumni Brunonians are known for their spirit of service. For many alumni, that philanthropic spirit began when they were still on College Hill. Students are at the forefront of promoting the importance of philanthropy and volunteerism to their peers. They inspire their classmates to carry on the Brown tradition of giving back and paying it forward. Brown Annual Fund Student Committee The Brown Annual Fund Student Committee (BAFSC) strives to build a strong foundation of altruism for the University. Through creative engagement, events, and personal outreach, the BAFSC educates fellow undergraduate students on the importance of giving back and how alumni giving helps shape the Brown experience. Committee members work in tandem with the Division of Advancement as student representatives on campus. The fundamental goal is to encourage students to start thinking philanthropically during their time at Brown.
