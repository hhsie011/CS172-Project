Medical, Pharmacy, Radiology and Lab Services Student Health Services (SHS) operates on an appointment-based system. Visits can be in-person or virtual, and many medical appointments can be scheduled for the same day. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, please call before walking-in without an appointment. Appointments for annual gynecological exams, physical exams, allergy injections and travel consultations should be made in advance. Our pharmacy is available to students who need new prescriptions filled or refills, with curbside, walk-up or pick-up service.

If you arrive more than five minutes late for your medical appointment, you will be asked to reschedule. If you have a virtual appointment, you will need to start the check-in process at least 20 minutes prior to your scheduled appointment as you must complete all online questionnaires before your appointment time.

Counseling and Psychological Services Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) provides counseling and psychiatric services to support students. These services are being delivered through in-person, videoconference or phone visits, promoting social distancing and reducing the spread of the virus to both the students and the providers. In-person visits will continue to follow Clemson University guidelines for social distancing. Emphasis is on assisting students to adapt and cope with factors outside their control while courageously acting on those factors within their power. Our overnight and over-the-weekend emergency phone-support service is available by calling the Clemson University Police Department at 864-656-2222 and asking to speak with the CAPS counselor on call. Initiating New Services Students seeking services should call CAPS reception at 864-656-2451 during business hours (8 a.m.-4:30 p.m.). Counselors will be available to conduct a brief phone screen to determine the best way to serve your needs. Ongoing Individual Counseling Students in established individual counseling relationships are to reply to secure messages from their counselors. Look for these secure messages in the MyHealth-e portal. Groups and Workshops Established groups will continue to be offered via videoconference. Group facilitators will reach out to group members, and group members are to reply promptly to the counselorâ€™s secure message for instructions. Psychiatric Services Both Dr. Mouzon and the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) telepsychiatrist will continue to provide services through in-person, videoconference or phone visits. These providers will contact students with scheduled appointments. Juanita Foster, RN, is the point of contact for the MUSC psychiatrist and will facilitate the visit. New appointments can be scheduled by calling CAPS reception at 864-656-2451. Students must call CAPS (864-656-2451) and undergo an intake assessment prior to scheduling an appointment with a psychiatrist. Text Message Appointment Reminders To receive automated text message appointment reminders from SHS on your cell phone, go to MyHealth-e and update your profile by entering your mobile phone number and carrier. If your phone number or carrier change, don't forget to update this information in MyHealth-e. Fees for Missed Appointments or Late Cancellation Student Health Services charges a fee for missed appointments and late cancellations. Charges vary by visit type; missed appointments with the psychiatrist incur the same charge as the visit charge. If necessary, cancel or reschedule your appointment by 11:59 p.m. the day before the scheduled appointment. This can be done in MyHealth-e. Please arrive 15 minutes prior to your scheduled appointment and check in at Registration. If you arrive more than 15 minutes late for your CAPS appointment, you may be charged a fee. Please note that CAPS providers abide by licensing laws and provide services, including remote services, in the state in which they are licensed. Therefore, students located outside South Carolina will be assisted with accessing care in their communities. The CAPS staff remains committed to supporting the Clemson University student population.
