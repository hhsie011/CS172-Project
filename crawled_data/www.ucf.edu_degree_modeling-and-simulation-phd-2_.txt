The UCF School of Modeling, Simulation, and Training (SMST) considers its degree programs as transdisciplinary, intended for those who wish to pursue a career in the fields of academia, government, military/defense, healthcare/medicine, entertainment, technology, education, or service/manufacturing. Most engineering or scientific fields use simulation as an exploration, modeling, or analysis technique. However, Modeling and Simulation is not limited to engineering and science, as it is also used in training, management, and concept exploration. These programs involve constructing human-centered, equipment-centered, and stand-alone computer-based models of existing and conceptual systems and processes. UCF SMST sought feedback from industry practitioners to identify key competencies for students in our degree programs. This input has been critical to the development of our curriculum, which is designed to provide a broad overall perspective of the developing simulation industry and an awareness of the economic considerations. UCF SMST's objective is to provide education on evaluating the human, organization, equipment, and systems under study through the evaluation of output from the corresponding simulation construct. Alumni of SMST degree programs have both general and specialized skills in Modeling and Simulation. Students in the Modeling and Simulation Ph.D. program are required to focus their study and research efforts in two areas of specialization. Students base their specialization on their academic and professional goals and determine these areas in consultation with their faculty adviser and the Modeling and Simulation graduate program director. Common areas of specialization are listed below (descriptions can be found at msgrad.ist.ucf.edu). This is not an exhaustive list, as the field continues to grow and evolve.

Behavioral Cybersecurity Computer Visualization Human Systems Instructional and Training Simulation Interactive Simulation and Intelligent Systems Simulation in Government and Military Simulation in Healthcare and Medicine Simulation Infrastructure Simulation Management Simulation Modeling and Analysis Program Prerequisites Though UCF SMST does not have a mandated prerequisite for its graduate programs, the most successful students are those who have an academic and/or work background that has prepared them in mathematics (introductory calculus and probability and statistics) and computer literacy, preferably, familiarity with at least one higher order programming language (e.g., Python, C/C++, Visual Basic, Java, etc.). Students with undergraduate or graduate degrees in Engineering, Computer Science, or Mathematics will generally have this background. Students without this background are encouraged to select the elective course IDC 5570 (Introductory Mathematics for Modeling and Simulation). This course will prepare them for the required core course COT 6571 (Mathematical Foundations of Modeling and Simulation). Degree Requirements Core 15 Total Credits Complete the following: COT6571 - Mathematical Foundations of Modeling and Simulation (3) IDS6147 - Perspectives on Modeling and Simulation (3) IDS6145 - Simulation Techniques (3) IDS6262 - Research Design for Modeling and Simulation (3) IDS6267 - Understanding Humans for Modeling and Simulation (3) Restricted Elective 3 Total Credits Complete all of the following Complete at least 1 of the following: IDC5602 - Cybersecurity: A Multidisciplinary Approach (3) IDC6601 - Behavioral Aspects of Cybersecurity (3) IDC6700 - Interdisciplinary Approach to Data Visualization (3) IDS5142 - Modeling and Simulation for Instructional Design (3) IDS6146 - Modeling and Simulation Systems (3) IDS6149 - Modeling and Simulation for Test and Evaluation (3) IDS6916 - Simulation Research Methods and Practicum (3) Students must select an elective course taught by the Modeling and Simulation Graduate Program. Approved courses are listed below, but others may be used with the program director's approval. Unrestricted Electives 39 Total Credits Earn at least 39 credits from the following types of courses: All Modeling and Simulation Ph.D. students must take at least 39 credits of unrestricted elective courses that reflect their two areas of specialization. Students are expected to carefully select electives with guidance from the program director and/or their faculty adviser. The UCF SMST has identified and approved over 175 courses that students may choose as unrestricted electives. This list can be found at msgrad.ist.ucf.edu. New courses are developed at the university every semester, so this list is updated once a semester. If a student identifies a course that will benefit their area of study but is not on the published list, they may request approval from the program director for inclusion in their plan of study. Unrestricted electives must consist of at least 9 credit hours of formal courses, excluding independent study. The remaining credits may consist of additional coursework, directed research, independent study, and additional dissertation as advised appropriately by faculty adviser and/or program director. Modeling and Simulation PhD Elective Courses 0 Total Credits Complete all of the following In addition to successfully completing the core courses for the M&S PhD program, students are required to carefully select electives with the guidance of a Program Director or faculty adviser. Elective choices should be made with the intent to strengthen a research interest and/or area of focus in order to meet the individual student's educational goals and objectives. Listed below are suggested courses in various areas of focus or specialization. These course groupings are mere guides, are not exhaustive and are only meant to assist with advising and course selection in order to meet the individual student's educational goals and objectives. They are not intended to restrict elective choices among focus areas as we strongly encourage Modeling and Simulation students to maintain an interdisciplinary approach to their graduate studies. If a student identifies another UCF course which may be of value to his/her M&S research area, but is not already identified in a list below, that student may request approval from the Graduate Program Director for the course to be used as an elective in the Graduate Plan of Study. All such requests must be made in advance of enrolling in the course. Those electives categorized as "General" and "Fundamentals of Modeling and Simulation" would be appropriate for all students regardless of interest area. The remaining categories are grouped by area of interest.
