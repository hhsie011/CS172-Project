Texas Tech University Directory Raiderlink A-Z Index Curriculum Menu Search TTU Office of the Provost Curriculum Lab Science Requirement The state of Texas requires that all students complete six credit hours in the Life and Physical Sciences area. Texas Tech University has an additional, two credit hour laboratory science requirement that is not included in the state's requirement. Courses that fulfill this institutional requirement are indicated with a ‡ symbol in the listing below. The total, eight credit hour Life and Physical Sciences requirement can be satisfied by taking two four hour combined lecture and lab science courses (for example, BIOL 1401 and 1402) or two 3-hour science lecture courses along with the accompanying laboratory courses (for example, ATMO 1300 and ATMO 1100, GEOL 1303 and GEOL 1101). It is also permissible to take one 4-hour science course and one 3-hour science course along with the accompanying laboratory course (such as BIOL 1401 and ATMO 1300 with ATMO 1100). Credit toward the science laboratory requirement is not granted for laboratory courses that do not share the same course prefix as the lecture course taken to satisfy a portion of the life and physical sciences core requirement. Transfer students who present 3-hour science courses may complete the science laboratory requirement in either of the following in ways: They may take a laboratory course that matches a 3-hour course accepted in transfer as satisfying a portion of the life and physical sciences requirement (for example, GEOL 1101 if the student transferred a course that was accepted as equivalent to GEOL 1303). They may enroll in BIOL 2202. This is a 2-hour self-paced online course designed specifically for transfer students who need to complete the science laboratory requirement. BIOL 2202 carries a biology prefix, but it is designed to be taken by any student who has completed one or two 3-hour science courses in any science discipline. The BIOL 2202 modules stress providing students with a framework for evaluating and critiquing scientific research findings and will help students understand the role of scientific research in improving human health, contributing to economic growth, answering basic questions about the world, and working toward solving a multitude of problems faced by modem society. BIOL 2202 is not available to students who complete their life and physical sciences requirement at Texas Tech University.
