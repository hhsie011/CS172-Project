Often cross-disciplinary, the workshops also offer faculty an opportunity to share drafts of their scholarly work. Taking a Workshop Students interested in one of the workshops below should contact the faculty member for more information and register for the class through my.harvard. Proposing a Workshop Faculty interested in establishing a research workshop may submit a proposal that includes at least two faculty members and six graduate students who intend to meet regularly over the course of the academic year. Participants may also invite visiting scholars (one or two per term) to speak. Grants of up to $3,000 per year are available and may be used to underwrite the cost of travel expenses for a guest scholar, photocopying materials, refreshments for meetings, and stipend for a student to coordinate workshop activities. If you have questions or would like more information on how to generate a workshop proposal, please contact Sheila Thomas.
