Religious communities also designate important times and seasons. These holidays—or Holy Days—can be weekly events such as the Jewish Sabbath, or annual events like Easter, or seasonal events such as Ramadan. These Holy Days and Festivals include special rituals or personal obligations such as fasting or almsgiving.
