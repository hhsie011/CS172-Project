HUCL also works with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) to review and refine its methodology for interpreting lab results to align with emergent best practices. Color, the health technology company partnering with Harvard for COVID-19 testing, will send you an email and text notification when your results are available. Negative Test Results If you test negative for COVID-19, no further action is needed. Continue to wear a mask if you feel the need to, maintain your required testing frequency, and practice good hygiene. Read more tips about how to keep Harvard healthy. Positive Test Results If you receive a notification of a positive test through Harvard’s testing program, it’s incredibly important to minimize your movement and exposure to others by returning or staying home and wearing a well-fitting mask at all times if in the presence of other household members. HUHS will contact you via your Harvard email about what it means to be positive and explain next steps, including isolation and notifying your close contacts. Contact tracers rely on email for most communication, so please check your Harvard email for instructions about next steps. As required by state law, the Massachusetts DPH will also be notified of any positive test result. Individuals are not routinely notified of their variant status because public health guidelines are the same regardless of the variant involved. After HUHS’ initial outreach with you, HUHS will contact: School/Unit emergency leads, including College housing (if applicable) Campus Services, including emergency management, environmental health and safety, security, facilities management, and dining services These two groups, in partnership with HUHS, will work together to mobilize local support. They will take great care to ensure your privacy while supporting your isolation and, if you’re living on campus, caring for you during the isolation period. See the Exposure, Quarantine, & Isolation page for more information on case support and isolation protocols. If you test positive outside of Harvard’s testing program, you should report your positive result to HUHS through Crimson Clear. If your positive result was on an outside antigen or PCR test, you should begin isolation even before the HUHS Contact Tracing team emails you. Unsatisfactory Sample Occasionally, your result may be unsatisfactory. If you receive an unsatisfactory result, you will need to take another test as soon as possible. If your repeat test requires clinical observation, HUHS will let you know. If you are in quarantine, it is acceptable to leave your home briefly in order to submit a test sample, but masks and physical distancing are required. Here are some common ways samples are classified as unsatisfactory: Tube cap popped off – Always make sure your cap is pushed on securely before submitting. Loose caps are the biggest reason samples are discarded. Failed to activate kit – Always make sure you receive a message from Color that your kit was successfully activated. This is what links the sample to an individual. If a kit is not activated, the sample will be discarded. Debris on swab – We recommend blowing your nose before collecting the sample; any solid debris on your swab will prevent the lab from processing your sample. Kit activated, but sat for a long time – Your sample needs to be placed in a collection bin as soon as possible. Samples not deposited in a bin within 24 hours from activation may be discarded by the lab. Be sure to check the testing calendar for pick-up dates and times. Inconclusive Sample In rare instances, the lab may be unable to interpret results for a test. You should not make any determinations about your current status based on the inconclusive result. If you receive an inconclusive result or a notification that the lab was unable to return results for your sample, please submit another test as soon as possible. If you are currently in isolation or quarantine, you should continue to adhere to relevant guidelines until additional results are received. Please Respect Individuals’ Privacy Anonymity for individuals who test positive for COVID-19 remains paramount. Please respect their privacy— even if you believe you know who they are—so they can focus completely on their health. As a community, we must do everything we can to support one another through this incredibly difficult time.
