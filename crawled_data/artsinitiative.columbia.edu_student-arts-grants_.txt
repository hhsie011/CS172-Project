Grants support performances and publications from recognized student groups that are non-curricular, with a priority given to undergraduate art making. Two Types of Student Arts Grants: Performance Grant Apply for a grant to support performances, with a focus on theater, dance, music, and cultural showcase events. Performance Grants range from $400–$1,000 Apply Publication Grant Apply for a grant to support printing costs for literary, visual art, and other printed arts publications. Publication Grants range from $200–$500 Apply Spring 2022 schedule: 2/11-3/7: Submission period Week of 3/21: Grant Recipients Announced 4/29: Deadline for submission of reconciliation info (or other date as specified on award letter) Eligibility To be eligible to receive a Student Arts Grant, your group must be a recognized Columbia University or Barnard College student organization. The primary purpose of the project must be student art-making, with priority given to undergraduates. The project must be non-curricular.
