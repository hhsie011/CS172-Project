Through our programs, international students will learn about U.S. culture, enjoy Baylor traditions and make friends that will last a lifetime. Global Friendship Program The Global Friendship Program (formerly known as the PAWS Program) is designed to help international students experience American traditions and customs, and developing friendships that will last by connecting with American students and families. Friendships with an American college student are helpful in learning how to navigate life at Baylor and the U.S. as well as getting connected to other American students. Connecting with local Waco families allows international students to become part of a local American family and experience the atmosphere of a home with a family off-campus. International students may connect with either US students or local families. Whether you are an international or US Baylor student, or a local Waco family, we have opportunities for you to get involved! Trips & Special Events Each semester, International Student and Scholar Services plans a series of events and trips that are fun and educational. You’ll have the opportunity to visit some amazing places as we explore Waco and other parts of Texas. Also, it will give you a great opportunity to meet and travel with fellow students from other countries! Previous schedules have included trips to NASA and San Antonio as well shopping at a premier outlet mall and our annual Thanksgiving Dinner. We also have our Popcorn & Culture Program several times a semester where we gather to hear speakers talk on important topics of international significance. Some events have a small fee but many are free! Remember that almost all of the events do require you to sign-up early so be sure to reserve your spot for these great events. The schedule will be available at the beginning of each semester. Also, we advertise these events during orientation and throughout the semester in the weekly BU World Weekly Email Newsletter! CGE Ambassadors The Center for Global Engagement ambassadors are a group of student leaders, both domestic and international, who represent the Center through events and programming. This may include welcoming international visitors and helping them adjust to life at Baylor, as well as talking to peers about study abroad. Academic and Language Support for International Students Baylor University offers numerous resources for international students to receive support in both their academics and English proficiency skills. Find out more about the support resources Baylor has to offer!
