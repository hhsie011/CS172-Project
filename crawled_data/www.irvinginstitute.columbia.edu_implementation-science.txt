Translating new public health and healthcare knowledge and research among practitioners, healthcare providers, patients, and the general public is complex, but critically important. Research is needed to help advance understanding of how to enhance the uptake, reach, and impact of scientific discoveries. Dissemination and implementation (D&I) research is the scientific study of methods and strategies to promote the adoption and integration of proven treatments, programs, and policies into routine use in diverse real-world settings and populations. Community-engaged research and partnerships with key stakeholders and a foundational focus on promoting health equity are critical components of high impact D&I research. Ultimately, D&I science can accelerate the pace of improving healthcare and health outcomes from research, with CTSA Program hubs well positioned to help advance science in this area. The Implementation Science Initiative at the Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Columbia University’s CTSA Program hub focuses on: 1) increasing awareness of and capacity for implementation science; 2) providing opportunities for education and training; and 3) facilitating research and collaborations in implementation science. We provide the Columbia Implementation Science seminar series with the New York State Psychiatric Institute, Working Group meeting, training and symposia, consultation services, pilot funding, and help build research capacity and connections. Services Implementation Science Consultation Service Implementation Science Seminar Series Intervention and Implementation Science Pilot Award Join Our Working Group The Implementation Science Initiative holds a regular Working Group meeting of faculty, post-docs, and students across a range of Columbia-wide schools, departments, and organizations. We meet monthly (the second Thursday of each month from 1-2 pm EST). This network of transdisciplinary researchers and practitioners shares a common interest in dissemination and implementation (D&I) science and practice across diverse topical areas, sectors, and contexts (e.g. emergency medicine, HIV, social work, mental health services, public health, cancer screening and treatment, digital health, aging, cardiovascular health, pediatrics, mental health), with efforts both domestically and globally. At monthly meetings, we share new resources for implementation science, have ‘works in progress’, build research capacity and collaboration, and plan collaborative projects, trainings, or events. If you would like access to more information from the Implementation Science SharePoint Group and view additional materials, please contact us. The Working Group has compiled resources, curricula, and readings on health equity and anti-racism. If you are unable to access this document, please email us for a copy. View the full list of Working Group members. To join our Working Group or share updates, grants, publications, or events you are aware of that relate to D&I science or practice please contact us: irvinginst_implement@cumc.columbia.edu Additional Resources Resources for Health Equity & Anti-Racism The Working Group has compiled a list of resources, curricula, and readings on health equity and anti-racism, as well as a Presentation of Health Equity Resources.
