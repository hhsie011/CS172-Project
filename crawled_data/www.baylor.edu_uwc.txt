The UWC is currently closed. We will reopen for Summer 1 on Monday, June 6. SUMMER 2022 (In-Person and Online) Dates: June 6-August 11 (closed on University Holidays) Hours: Mon-Thu: 9:00am-6:00pm CT Location: Moody Library, 2nd floor West Phone: (254) 710-4849 Email: UWC@baylor.edu About the UWC At the University Writing Center (UWC), we offer free personal consulting in all areas of writing and composing at any stage of the writing process. Whether you want a reader for a final draft, to brainstorm ideas, or to discuss an entire assignment, the UWC can help. Because everyone writes differently, we tailor our support to meet each writer's needs. We believe that writing benefits from feedback and response, so the UWC is a place for dialogue and conversation. We take the time to talk about your writing so that you can become a better writer, reviewer, and editor of your own work. We are qualified readers of print-based, digital, and new media compositions. Some of the print-based documents we review include academic essays, research papers, lab reports, literature reviews, job applications, proposals, personal statements, resumes, and CVs. We also consult over digital, visual, and multimodal compositions, including audio and video essays, brochures, flyers, websites, digital stories, research posters, and other new media projects. We also help with issues particular to ESL writers. We offer three types of consultations at the UWC. Click on any of the following hyperlinks for more information: In-Person Tutoring Online Consultations: Video Conferencing (immediate feedback via video) Written Feedback (written feedback within 48 business hours) Please visit these webpages to determine what will work best for you.
