President Swearer had the foresight to locate the new center within the Dean of the College’s office — at the heart of the undergraduate curriculum. He strongly believed, as President Christina Paxson does today, that public service and experiential learning are essential components of Brown’s educational mission. Today, the Howard R. Swearer Center works with more than 1,200 Brown students, through and with 80+ community partners — more than half of which are in the Greater Providence area. Throughout our history, we have developed and nurtured many deep — and deeply rewarding — relationships with individuals and organizations in Providence that continue to inspire us and our work. We connect students, faculty, and community partners through community engagement, engaged scholarship, and social innovation — three key perspectives that are the foundations of our work.
