Será que, nas eleições presidenciais de 2018, o Brasil conseguirá digerir conflitos passados e avançar como um só, pavimentando um novo caminho de crescimento? Ou será que as diferentes visões políticas serão usadas, mais uma vez, para separar e distanciar a população? Independentemente de qual governo for eleito, é preciso ter como principal objetivo a superação da desigualdade, a maior chaga brasileira.
