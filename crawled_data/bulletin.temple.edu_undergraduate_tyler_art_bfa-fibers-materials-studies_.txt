Students explore the expressive potential and social meaning of fiber materials as they learn technical skills that prepare them for focused, graduate-level study and a variety of careers. Tyler Fibers & Materials Studies majors join a close-knit, inclusive community led by a strong, diverse faculty that pushes students to experiment and collaborate. Students learn traditional skills and activate them in a contemporary context, contributing to vital discussions on history, identity, current social issues and more. Through dynamic events and projects such as the annual Wearable Art Show and the Natural Dye Garden, Fibers & Materials Studies majors create exciting conversations with artists and students throughout Tyler. Students take full advantage of Philadelphia's vibrant fibers community and DIY scene and opportunities to engage global social challenges, working closely with professors to engage in community-based projects that challenge them as critical, reflective participants in a broader creative culture. These experiences prepare Fibers & Materials Studies majors to flourish in top graduate programs and production design careers. Degree Requirements The Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Fibers & Materials Studies may be conferred upon a student by recommendation of the faculty and upon the satisfactory completion of a minimum of 126 semester hours of credit with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00. All Fibers & Materials Studies majors must complete the BFA curriculum and General Education requirements. Students must earn a C- or better in ART 2201 and ART 2202 to enter the Fibers & Materials Studies major. The seven required Junior/Senior studio courses, ART 4205 and ART 4096 (capstone) must be completed with a C- or better to fulfill major requirements.

Fibers and Materials Studies majors interested in studying abroad should consult with an academic advisor to determine if a semester (generally spring semester of second year) or a summer program would be the best option to remain on track for graduation.
