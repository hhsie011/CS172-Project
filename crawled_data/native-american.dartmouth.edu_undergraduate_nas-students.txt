(Photo by Eli Burakian '00) PreviousNext Native Americans at Dartmouth The Native Americans at Dartmouth (NAD) organization is strictly a student organization, a voluntary group of Native American students who meet three or four times each term to determine their agenda of activities for the term. This might include working on joint concerns of their group and planning to improve the environment for NAD campus-wide. The NAD also plans an annual Spring Dartmouth College Pow Wow on the weekend of Mother's Day. Native American Writing Prize The Native American Writing Prize is awarded each year by the Native American Studies Program in recognition of one outstanding piece of writing or consistently excellent writing by a Dartmouth Native student. In some years two students have been given the award. The award has been funded since 1997 by royalties from the sale of the book, After King Philip's War: Presence and Persistence in Indian New England, edited by Colin G. Calloway and others. The funds will be supplemented by a portion of the royalties from the forthcoming book Native Americans and Dartmouth: The Indian History of an American Institution, edited by Professor Colin G. Calloway.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Native American and Indigenous Studies Undergraduate Overview Major and Minor Courses Honors Program Waitlists and Applications NAS 85 Independent Study Rules & Procedures NAS Students Writing Prize Award Recipients Alumni - Tell Us Your Story 2020 2021 Funding for Internships and Independent Research Off-Campus Program Research Overview Gordon Russell Visiting Professorship Gordon Russell Visiting Professorship Alumni Charles Eastman Fellowship Eastman Fellowship Alumni Tribal Scholar Fellowship Program Tribal Scholar Fellowship Alumni Resources News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
