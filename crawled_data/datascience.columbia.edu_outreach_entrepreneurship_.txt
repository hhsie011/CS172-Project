Encouraging entrepreneurship and developing an entrepreneurial ecosystem for the Institute’s faculty and staff who are interested in starting companies is an important component of DSI’s mission and has emerged as a central educational theme within Columbia Engineering. Columbia Engineering promotes engineering innovation and engaged entrepreneurship. Its entrepreneurship programs provide education and support for Columbia Engineering students and faculty, socially engaged entrepreneurs, and the Harlem community through the following: Developing, implementing, and sustaining innovative entrepreneurship education programming Supporting Columbia students with new business ideas Building virtual and physical infrastructures that promote new technology ideas, facilitate technology transfer, and incubate new products, process, and service ventures Facilitating cross-campus collaborations and community partnerships The strong entrepreneurial culture at Columbia is led by one of the most experienced and successful technology transfer offices in the world, Columbia Technology Ventures (CTV), which each year, on average, manages approximately 300 new inventions from Columbia inventors; executes 50 to 70 license agreements; launches 15 new companies; and generates in excess of $135 million in gross licensing revenues. In fact, over its 17-year history, CTV’s cumulative record includes 4,000 inventions; 1,800 patents; 500 licenses; and the creation of 128 new companies (81 of them still active). By combining and coordinating the resources of CTV and Columbia’s professional schools, the Institute will be able to both increase the number of startup companies formed around innovation in the data sciences and engineering, and strengthen those that do launch. A priority for CTV and the Institute will be to develop incentives for startup ventures to locate in New York City and remain here. DSI works with the broader entrepreneurship programs at Columbia Engineering and at the University level to provide our faculty and students with both general and data science specific resources to enable them to more effectively engage in company creation.
