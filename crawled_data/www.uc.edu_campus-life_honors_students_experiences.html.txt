There are three types of honors experiences: honors seminars, pre-approved experiences, and self-designed experiences. Current Students: Access the UHP Database Types of Honors Experiences Honors Seminars Three-credit hour, interdisciplinary courses designed by faculty to engage students in special topics. All seminars are open to UHP students from all disciplines. We typically offer 10-12 honors seminars each fall and spring semester. Typically, 3-5 of those include study tours each fall and spring. In summer, we typically offer 1-3 honors seminars. How to Register Fall 2022 Seminars Spring 2023 Seminars Summer 2023 Seminars Past Seminars Pre-Approved Experiences Co-curricular programs and other opportunities approved by the University Honors Program that include the key elements of honors experiences - engagement in experiential learning, ongoing and summative reflection, and integration of learning. Pre-Approved Experiences Self-Designed Experiences Individual projects proposed by students. Students take the responsibility to develop their own experiential learning opportunity based on their own interests and goals. Students work with an advisor who has expertise in the area of their choice and identify academic resources as a foundation to plan their experience and reflection process.
