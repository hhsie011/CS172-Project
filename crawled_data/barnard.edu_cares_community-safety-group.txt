Using input from many different groups, identities, and constituencies, the evolving work of this council will be both strategic and tactical, conceptual and practical. CSAC is an important part of the College’s commitment to examining the intersections of identity, civic life, and social justice not just on our campus but also in the larger context of Columbia University and Morningside Heights, the dynamics of New York City, and the national and international climates so that we can create a place where all members of our community feel acknowledged and respected. The 2021-2022 charge for CSAC include: Work closely with the CARES team to educate and define community safety at Barnard. Host public events and regularly engage Barnard students, faculty, and staff to seek broad input on how to improve community safety. Serve as a liaison for community concerns or issues that relate to campus safety in all its forms. Assist with review and publishing an annual report on the work conducted by CARES, which will include an evaluation of campus safety efforts. Continue to identify structures and policies at Barnard, particularly in regards to safety, that diminish safe and equitable inclusive access for all Barnard community members and offer proposals to institutional leadership. Advisory Council Members The Community Safety Advisory Council is co-chaired by Amy Zavadil and Cammie Jones, and the 2021-2022 members are: Amy Zavadill, Associate Vice President for CARES Jennifer Rosales, Vice President for Inclusion and Engaged Learning, Chief Diversity Officer Elizabeth Scott Francis, Director, Nondiscrimination & Title IX Student Experience & Engagement Rep (staff) SGA Rep (student) Clery Intern Rep (student) 1-2 Faculty Members Community Safety Staff Rep You are welcome to email CARESTeam@barnard.edu to share your comments or express your interest in volunteering to support the work of the Barnard Community Safety Advisory Council.

History of Community Safety Advisory Council What is the prior work of this group? Community Safety Group Barnard College prides itself on academic excellence, which cannot exist without a diverse community where everyone feels welcome and safe. To support these values, Barnard formed the Community Safety Group in April 2019. Reporting to the President, this Group was charged with discussing broad issues related to campus safety, including concerns about racial and other forms of bias and their consequences, accessibility, who feels welcome in different spaces, and advising on improved structures for relationship building, training, and community oversight. Using input from many different groups, identities, and constituencies, the evolving work of this group will be both strategic and tactical, conceptual and practical. Matters for the Group to address included: Providing opportunities for diverse voices to be heard and acknowledged in ongoing open sessions where people can share their personal experiences with matters of safety on our campus; Determining an overall philosophy of how to keep people safe on campus and how the current mission of public safety aligns with it; Considering the use of language in communications about campus safety; Reviewing the relationships between Community Safety and the community, particularly students, faculty, staff, and visitors of color; Recommending how current policies, procedures, and practices of Community Safety can be improved to meet the needs of the diverse populations on campus; Providing advice and input regarding Community Safety training curriculum and content; Providing advice and input regarding training and support for members of the community; and Developing clear and transparent procedures for when community members have concerns about the conduct of Community Safety staff.
