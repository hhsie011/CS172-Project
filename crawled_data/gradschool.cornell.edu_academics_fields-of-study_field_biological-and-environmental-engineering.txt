The M.S. and Ph.D. research degrees require submission of an acceptable thesis or dissertation. The professional degree of Master of Engineering (Biological and Environmental) is intended primarily for students who plan to enter engineering practice. This program is intended to develop students' backgrounds in engineering design as well as to improve their fundamental engineering knowledge. The professional degree of Master of Professional Studies (Agriculture) is ideal for career-focused students interested in the thorough study of issues and advancements in the fields of life, social and environmental sciences and agriculture. In addition, the M.P.S. (Agriculture & Life Sciences) program has a Peace Corp option in which the student undertakes two semesters of academic work at Cornell and a Peace Corp assignment. For information and instructions on how to apply, check the M.P.S. (Agriculture and Life Sciences)/Peace Corps Web site, or contact International Programs, B075 Mann Library, Ithaca, NY 14853; phone 607-255-3035; email peacecorps@cornell.edu.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
