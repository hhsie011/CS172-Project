Launched in 2019, the Applied Research Fellowship was created – and continues to be run – in partnership with the University of Washington’s Center for Studies in Demography & Ecology. The program’s goal is to offer students data analysis, critical thinking and team science skills that will help them solve complex population health challenges on their way to becoming future leaders in the field. The cohort of students selected for this year’s fellowship program are: Name Degree Program School Oliver Tjalve Sociology and Statistics College of Arts & Sciences Chris Govella Real Estate College of Built Environments Jenna Castillo Sociology College of Arts & Sciences Maxine Wright Sociology College of Arts & Sciences Mary Jewell Epidemiology School of Public Health These students will spend 10 weeks over the summer working collaboratively with King County’s demographer and Public Health – Seattle & King County’s Assessment, Policy Development and Evaluation Unit with the support of the Population Health Applied Research Fellowships. They will estimate trends in household size and household characteristics across the county to build on the efforts of the 2021 cohort of applied research fellows. This work is particularly relevant for policymakers and future resource allocators, as it helps them understand indicator trends across time and space, and how these trends vary across age, race and space. The dramatic changes in size, geographic distribution and demographic makeup of King County also contribute to the significance of this work. The opportunity for students to work on a real-world, client-driven project as part of a multidisciplinary team will benefit their understanding how to integrate their disciplinary expertise into a team-oriented, problem-solving approach that develops interdisciplinary solutions to population health challenges.
