The mission of OSI is to encourage a comprehensive learning environment through the promotion and implementation of the Academic Honor Code/Student Code of Conduct to foster integrity and ethical conduct within the Georgia Tech community. Georgia Tech's Student Code of Conduct prohibits discrimination, including discrimination on the basis of sex.
