About Community Navigation About Community About the Central Carolina Cornell Club The Club is for alumni, friends, parents of Cornellians, and all interested in Cornell University. We sponsor a variety of events and activities throughout the year to promote Cornell University, our Cornell community, local events, and alumni interests. Please update your information on Cornell Connect to receive emails about our future events. It is our mission to maintain a club that serves the social, family, and networking needs of all our members. Our club provides opportunity to bond with new members, as well as recapture friendships from years gone by. The Central Carolina Cornell Club is a center for good times, as well as meaningful discussion. We hope this is what you take with you each time you attend a meeting, a function, or family event. We welcome suggestions and involvement! Is there an event or activity, tour or concert which interests you? Then take the lead and turn it into a Cornell alumni opportunity! Let us know about it!
