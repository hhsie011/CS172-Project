Be a part of our annual spring show Join our team! Join the only collegiate ballroom dance team in Philadelphia Previous Next Summer 2022 update: We are continuing with in-person classes in the summer. Please see our class schedule. Penn Latin and Ballroom Dance (PLBD) is a student organization at the University of Pennsylvania. Our goal is to teach and promote Latin and Ballroom dancing to Penn students and other members of the Philadelphia community. No partner needed. We welcome beginners! In fact, most people currently on the team had no prior dance experience. In addition to providing DanceSport lessons and social dance lessons, we compete in collegiate competitions in the Northeast and put together dance performances throughout the year. If you don't want to compete and just want to take dance lessons - that's perfectly fine too! Please check out our FAQ or contact us if you still have more questions.
