Campus Ministry at Wichita State University is: Conversation about things that matter; Service that makes a difference; and Spirituality that equips us for life! Rooted in the life and teaching of Jesus and the mainstream of tradition, we give witness to a grace based understanding of Christianity. Knowing that men and women are created in God’s image, we think science, the arts, and an awe of mystery all contribute to what it means to be fully human. Where are you at on your journey? What questions do you wrestle with? How have you encountered God? What is your deepest joy? What practices sustain you? Let's talk! We invite you to CONNECT and explore life and faith with us! » CONNECT with us on Facebook! Check out CONNECT!
