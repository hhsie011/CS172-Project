We strive to make each testing experience as successful as possible. Testing dates change on a semester basis, but we do offer sessions regularly and throughout the summer. Due to limited seating, testing at our facility by appointment is encouraged. If you do not feel well or have a fever, you need to reschedule your testing appointment. Steps we are taking to keep you safe: Sanitizing stations have been installed at building entrances and at the top of stairs. Plexiglass guards have been installed at check-in desks. Sanitizing workstations and equipment between each candidate.
