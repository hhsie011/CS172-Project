Related Links Office of Global Education Global Engagement Getting Started Students who are interested in studying abroad should attend the Study Abroad Fair in early September of their sophomore year. Following the fair, students are able to make advising appointments with staff from the Office of Global Education to learn more about the programs available and the application process. After students have confirmed their study abroad program, they will need to receive approval from the Senior Associate Dean and begin to get courses approved. Students should consult the study abroad guidelines for their concentration for information specific to their area of study.
