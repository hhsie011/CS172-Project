Over the last few weeks, we have heard many stories of patience, resilience, and creativity as we resumed the semester through online instruction. We are proud that, despite our distances, we have maintained our Red Raider community that we have worked so hard to nurture. Today, we are writing to share an announcement related to adjustments to the University's normal grading procedures for undergraduate and graduate students that will apply to the Spring 2020 semester only. These adjustments are being made, not as an easing of our academic standards, but as an acknowledgement and understanding that we are learning and growing together through these challenging times. For the Spring 2020 semester, faculty members will assign grades as they normally would. Once they post grades, students will have the option to choose to have individual course grades of C- or better changed to Credit (CR) or No Credit (NC) by the Office of the Registrar. If a student is taking a course as a prerequisite for a course in sequence, the grade of CR will be sufficient to allow the student to move to the next course in sequence. A grade of CR will not factor into the student's GPA. A full explanation of grading options is available for undergraduate and graduate students. As part of our commitment to the principles of shared governance, the undergraduate policy has been reviewed by the Faculty Senate and the Graduate Council has reviewed the proposal for graduate students. The School of Law will soon be sharing their policy for professional students. We stand with the entire faculty and staff in our commitment to deliver a high-quality distance education through this unique moment in the history of Texas Tech University. We wish for all the best for you and your families and her here to support you through a successful Spring semester.
