Flores, Visiting Scholar Talk March 24, 2022 at 6:00pm – 7:30pm EDT Heroy Geology Laboratory, Heroy Auditorium This event has already occurred. The information may no longer be valid. Visiting rhetorical scholar Lisa A. Flores, Ph.D., will deliver the talk “The Im/Possibilities of Gendered/Racialized Im/Mobilities.” Flores is a professor in the Department of Communication at the University of Colorado Boulder. She is guided by the argument that the vocabularies we speak and the stories we tell create the worlds we inhabit. In her research, Flores studies narratives of privilege and disadvantage, particularly as they play out in public discourse around questions of race, gender, nation and labor. She is the author of “Deportable and Disposable: Public Rhetoric and the Making of the ‘Illegal’ Immigrant” (Penn State University Press, Fall 2020), as well as a number of essays appearing in journals, such as the Quarterly Journal of Speech, Rhetoric & Public Affairs, and Critical Studies in Media Communication. Her current work examines mobility and containment as rhetorical mechanisms of race, gender and sexuality. This event was published on March 11, 2022.
