The emergence of COVID-19, however, creates new complexity in regard to the global energy economy, patterns of supply and demand, and anticipated investments. This webinar, in partnership with Columbia | SIPA Center on Global Energy Policy, explored the global market context, as well as clean energy policies and measures that are taking shape around the globe and in the Middle East.

Health Status and Reproductive Health among Postpartum Syrian Refugee Women in Jordan This project, spearheaded by Jennifer Dohrn, Associate Professor of Nursing at Columbia University Medical Center, examined the health status, reproductive health knowledge, attitudes, and practices of postpartum Syrian refugee women who live outside of formal camps in host communities across Jordan. The aim was to better understand the health needs and reproductive health practices of these women for the purpose of sharing recommendations and informing policy directions to provide reproductive health services more reflective of their voices and responsive to their needs. The project was carried out in partnership with the schools of nursing at Columbia University and the University of Jordan.
