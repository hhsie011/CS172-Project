July 28, 2015 Ari Goldman, Professor of Journalism at Columbia University and Director of the Scripps Howard Program in Religion, Journalism, and the Spiritual Life, visited Jordan on 28-30 July, 2015 to prepare for his “Covering Religion” course at Columbia University. Professor Goldman conducted preliminary work for research that explores media trends and practices in covering religion. The Amman Center identified and scheduled meetings with local scholars of religion and media, faith-based humanitarian agencies, and professional journalists from various sectarian, political and social domains. The meetings generated a discussion to better understand the following: How different religions are covered in the media and popular culture in a society where religion plays a vital role in everyday life The role of religion and media in the formation of religious and cultural identity The role of religion as a coping strategy, both in the lives of refugees and as a motivating factor for relief workers How refugees are portrayed in the media How religion is factored in the coverage These meetings provided an insight into the media and humanitarian landscape in Jordan, and generated opportunities for Professor Goldman’s next visit in December 2015.
