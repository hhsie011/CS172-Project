In it, students serve as mentors and additional resources for their fellow students. Whether exploring an unmet need, designing a value proposition, or developing a sustainability model, PEIRs work with founders to clarify and sharpen their ideas. Many PEIRs, through their own ventures or through internships and other experiences, have knowledge of particular sectors and can help refer students to additional resources. Learn more about this year’s cohort here. “I always knew I was interested in entrepreneurship but didn’t know where to start. The advice I received from one-on-one office hours with PEIRs helped me start a venture of my own. Seeing the impact the PEIRs made on me motivated to help fellow students the way fellow students helped me.” Samanee Mahbub ’19, History 2018 PEIR Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA Phone: 401-863-1000 Maps / Contact Us / Accessibility © 2017 Brown University Connect with us: Facebook Youtube Instagram Twitter Copyright 2018 Brown University
