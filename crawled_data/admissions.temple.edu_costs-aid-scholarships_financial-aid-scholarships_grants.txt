While scholarships are typically merit-based, grants are most commonly awarded according to your family’s financial need and offered by the federal government, state governments and Temple University. Your grant options are determined by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Submit your FAFSA, and then do your own research so you can understand your aid package. Federal Grants The U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Federal Student Aid offers a variety of grants to students attending four-year universities. The following are among the federal grants you should research. Federal Pell Grants Federal Pell Grants are awarded to undergraduate students who have not earned a bachelor’s or professional degree. The amount of these grants can change annually and is dependent on your financial need, cost of attendance and enrollment status per semester. A Federal Pell Grant cannot be awarded for more than 12 semesters or the equivalent. The amount of this grant is not affected by the amount of any other student aid for which you might qualify. Learn more about Federal Pell Grants and qualifications. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant The Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOGs) are awarded to undergraduates with exceptional financial need on a first-come, first-served basis. Priority is given to students receiving Federal Pell Grants. Learn more about FSEOGs and qualifications. State Grants and Special Programs Administered by the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Authority, the following grants are among the programs available to qualified undergraduate applicants. Explore more state educational funding opportunities. Pennsylvania State Grants The Pennsylvania State Grant program awards undergraduate Pennsylvania residents who are pursuing their first bachelor’s degree in an approved program of study of at least two years in length. Grant amounts are dependent upon enrollment and classroom and/or online credit hours per semester. Learn more about the PA State Grant program and qualifications. Ready to Succeed Scholarship The Ready to Succeed Scholarship (RTSS) Program, which is funded by the Pennsylvania General Assembly, provides support to high-achieving students whose annual family income does not exceed $110,000. Awards of up to $2,000 for full-time students and $1,000 for part-time students can be used to pay for tuition, books, fees, supplies and living expenses. In order to be considered for the RTSS, you must demonstrate academic excellence by attaining a minimum cumulative 3.5 GPA. Learn more about the RTSS Program and qualifications. Temple University Grant Temple University Grants (TUGs) are need-based grants for full-time undergraduate students pursuing their first bachelor’s degree.
