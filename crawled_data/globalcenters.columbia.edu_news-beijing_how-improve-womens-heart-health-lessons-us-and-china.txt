Lessons from the U.S. and China Beijing How to Improve Women's Heart Health? Lessons from the U.S. and China March 08, 2022 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is thought of as a “man’s disease”, but it remains the leading global cause of death among women, responsible for 35% of female deaths each year. Despite women being more likely to experience atypical symptoms such as nausea or vomiting, CVD among women remains understudied, under-recognized, under-diagnosed, and under-treated, with women under-represented in clinical trials. In celebration of American Heart Month and International Women’s Day, Columbia Global Centers | Beijing and the Women Creating Change initiative of the Center for the Study of Social Difference at Columbia University jointly gathered a panel of seasoned CVD experts from Columbia University and China to look at what we can learn from international comparisons and discuss ways to improve women's heart health in different health systems. The Number 1 Killer of Women The lack of awareness of CVD is putting women’s lives in both countries at risk and lowering survival rates. Dr. Tolani, Co-Director of the Women's Heart Center at Columbia University, mentioned only about 60% of women in the U.S. realized that heart disease is their number 1 killer. The number is less than 10% in China, according to Dr. Ying Xie, Attending Physician at Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital Department of Cardiology. Putting Others before Themselves Dr. Xi Chu, Director of Health Management Center at Capital Medical University's Xuanwu Hospital, pointed out that women, as primary caregivers to their family, often pay more attention to their family’s health than their own. In the meantime, women tend to underestimate the threat of CVD due to the misperception that women are more ‘protected’ than men against CVD. Disparity in Access, Diagnosis, and Treatment The discussion highlighted the barriers to equitable cardiovascular care that women face across the globe, leading the audience to a better understanding of the disease in women. Dr. Elaine Wan, Columbia University Medical Center's Esther Aboodi Associate Professor of Medicine in Cardiology, stressed that women and men have very different presentation symptoms of CVD. Dr. Rong He, Chief Physician at Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital Department of Cardiology, commented on the differences in anticoagulation practices in the U.S. and China, as well as the efforts made by Chinese hospitals to improve anticoagulation. Tools and Strategies to Improve CVD Prevention and Treatment in Women The discussion also evaluated how wearable devices are used for cardiovascular disease monitoring and risk reduction. Dr. Ying Xie talked about positive actions taken by several medical associations in China to improve the participation of female physicians and patients in the research and clinical trials on CVD. Dr. Rong He shared the best practices of utilizing social media to raise awareness, provide guidance, and encourage healthy activities and lifestyles.
