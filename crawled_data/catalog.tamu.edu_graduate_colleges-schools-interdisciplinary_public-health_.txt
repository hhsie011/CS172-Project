Offering classes at the College Station campus as well as other Texas locations through distance education, the school provides a bachelors program and graduate level programs including two master's degrees (Master of Public Health and Master of Health Administration) in several public health disciplines: epidemiology, biostatistics, environmental health, occupational safety and health, health administration, policy and management, and health promotion and community health sciences. The school also offers a Doctor of Public Health with concentrations in epidemiology, environmental health, and health promotion and community health sciences, and a Doctor of Philosophy in health services research. The school provides an excellent forum for tomorrow’s public health leaders to engage in a learning environment that builds on a wide array of research strengths and scholarly inquiry of a stellar faculty (seven of whom have received the prestigious designations of Regents Professors and one Distinguished Professor). Further, the research and practice links established by the faculty provide an extensive diversity of opportunities for students to work closely with professionals in applied public health settings.
