The mission of University Advancement and Alumni Engagement is to support and advance the mission of TU by increasing engagement in and financial support of the institution. In this role, the 50-member University Advancement and Alumni Engagement team leads TU’s fundraising, alumni relations and stewardship efforts through meaningful experiences that foster lifelong relationships and promote student success. Why Give Make an immediate impact by providing scholarships, improving technology, and beautifying our campus. How to Give Make gifts by check, credit card, or automatic bank drafts – learn about estate planning and stock gifts. Where to Give Direct your charitable contribution to the program, project, or department of your choice. Annual Fund Your gift to the TU Annual Fund provides the critical foundation of support the University needs to continue toward its goal of being recognized as one of the nation’s Top 50 institutions of higher education. The breadth of financial support from alumni is one of the benchmarks used in national rankings of universities through surveys such as those conducted US News and World Report and The Princeton Review. In other words, it doesn’t matter how big your gift is but, rather, that you are counted as donor to the University. It is impossible to overstate the importance of the TU Annual Fund and its impact on the day-to-day life of TU. Budgeted funds are earmarked for specific purposes and are often allocated before the fiscal year even begins. Annual Fund support, on the other hand, provides the needed flexibility to take advantage of unexpected opportunities or address unforeseen challenges that may have no other dedicated funding source. You may direct your gift to any area of the University you wish to support. These may include the general scholarship fund, any academic departments, your favorite athletic program, or to the University in general. And remember – your support of the TU Annual Fund is greatly appreciated! Make a gift to TU Endowed Funds An endowed fund generates earnings year after year, ensuring that ongoing financial support will be sustained at The University of Tulsa. Endowed funds create a continuing and meaningful tribute to their namesakes. Many alumni and friends have contributed funds created in memory of professors that have touched their lives. You can also honor friends and family through endowed funds. If you, your family or your organization is interested in establishing an endowed scholarship, please contact the Development Office at (918) 631-2561.
