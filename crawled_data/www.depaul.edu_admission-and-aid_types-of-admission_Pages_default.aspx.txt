But not every path is the same. We provide an education that’s accessible to everyone — no matter what you’re up to outside of class. There are nine student types at DePaul. Find the one that best fits you and learn more about applying. Degree-seeking Freshman Student You are under age 24 and have completed at least six semesters of high school. Transfer Student You are under age 24 and have completed college courses at a regionally accredited institution. Adult Undergraduate Student You are age 24 or over, with or without prior college coursework, and are interested in an undergraduate degree. Graduate Student You have an undergraduate degree and are applying for a graduate degree program. Or you want to take graduate courses without pursuing a degree. International Student You have been educated outside the United States and will submit international educational credentials as part of your application, and/or you are or will have F-1 or J-1 visa status. Returning Student You are a former DePaul student previously enrolled in an undergraduate degree program who has been absent from the university for three or more consecutive quarters (excluding summer sessions). Non-degree Visiting Undergraduate Student You are a high school student, high school graduate or a college student interested in taking undergraduate courses for credit that will transfer to another institution. Non-Degree Student You are a college graduate interested in taking courses for credit (i.e., for graduate school preparation, career development or personal interest) without the intent of completing a degree. Continuing Education Student You are a professional seeking an online certificate, endorsement or review course. These options do not require an application. Simply find your program of interest and register. Online Degrees & Coursework DePaul offers many courses and entire degrees online.
