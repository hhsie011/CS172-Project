Name: Timothy Sellnow Position: Pegasus Professor and associate director of Graduate Studies, Research and Creative Activity in the Nicholson School of Communication and Media Why are you interested in this research? I’ve always been fascinated by how some communities and organizations do better at avoiding or recovering from crises than others. This fascination motivated be to join the emerging community of risk and crisis communication scholars very early in my graduate education. Are you a faculty member or student conducting research at UCF? We want to hear from you! Tell us about your research at bit.ly/ucf-research-60-form. Who inspires you to conduct your research? I’m always inspired by the community leaders we meet. My wife, UCF colleague, and research partner, Deanna, and I just spent returned from a research trip to Puerto Rico. We met some true heroes who are working tirelessly to help the Island continue recovering from the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria. How does UCF empower you to do your research? The Nicholson School of Communication and Media and the College of Science provides tremendous support. I’m grateful to work with excellent leaders such as Robert Littlefield, Michael D. Johnson, and Maggy Tomova. What major grants and honors have you earned to support your research? I’ve been on research teams funded by the CDC, WHO, USDA, EPA, DHS, FEMA, and others. This funding has enabled us to solve some troubling communication problems. Why is this research important? Risk and crisis communication research helps us anticipate the messages needed to help people protect themselves and their loved ones. In many situations, these messages are the difference between life and death.
