According to the most recent Census figures available, Hispanics/Latinos currently represent more than 39% of the Texas population. The Census Bureau projects that by the year 2030, immigration will surpass natural increase as the primary contributor to population growth in the United States. The timing of this initiative is responsive to these changing demographics and future trends. The Baylor in Latin America initiative positions the University to be one of the most extensively engaged faith-based universities in the nation with regard to work in the Americas, further bolstered by the University's strong ties to Baptist and Christian life, both in Texas and abroad. We will seek opportunities to scale existing congregational partnerships and explore new avenues that maximize the work of laity, vocational ministers, and Hispanic-serving organizations that work at the community level. Areas of inquiry will reflect needs in high-impact geographical areas and meaningful collaboration across content areas and disciplines such as health and disease prevention; business development and international trade; human capital formation and education; immigration, migration, and human trafficking; congregational development; democratic governance and economics; and culture and arts.
