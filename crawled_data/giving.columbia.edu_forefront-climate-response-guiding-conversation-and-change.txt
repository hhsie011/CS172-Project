Columbia Climate School News Share Share Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Cancel Strengthened by the 2020 launch of the Columbia Climate School, the University continues to lead the global climate action effort through initiatives like the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), where Columbia scholars shaped urgent conversations and guided meaningful change. Heads of state, business leaders and members of civil society all gathered in Glasgow for two weeks in November to deliberate on what more needs to happen to keep the goal of limiting Earth’s warming to 1.5 degrees C. This year the Columbia Climate School expanded its presence at COP26 by hosting special events and sharing stories that included a variety of perspectives from global thought leaders, students, and experts.
