Most of our teaching partners interview on campus by participating in our Interview Days events held each fall and spring semesters. The October Interview Days is the time to interview students who will begin their first rotations in the spring semester (January). The March Interview Days event is the time to interview students who will begin their first rotations in either the summer semester (May) or the fall semester (August). The co-op advisors work closely with the students and the companies to set up full or partial day schedules of 30 minute interviews during this event. Companies registered with the Co-op Program receive invitations several weeks in advance of these events. Our teaching partners find Interview Days to be an organized and efficient means to connect with a pool of highly qualified students. Companies that cannot attend Interview Days may opt to select “Resume Collection” when registering for the event. Many of our out-of-town teaching partners make hotel reservations at Clemson University’s Martin Inn. A shuttle is available to take all employers from the Martin Inn to the Hendrix Center where the interviews are held. When contacting the Martin Inn (1-888-654-9020), let the reservationist know that you are participating in Co-op Interview Days. Directions to the inn can be found on the hotel website. IMPORTANT: If you are not staying in town overnight, it is still important to use the parking with shuttle service we provide from the Martin Inn because parking space on campus is extremely limited.
