This is the first award from the Honors College designed for students in Tulsa. “We want to give students at OSU-Tulsa the chance to be recognized for their intellectual and personal potential,” said Dr. Keith Garbutt, dean of the OSU Honors College. “We hope students in Tulsa will seize this opportunity to challenge themselves and stand out among their peers.” The OSU-Tulsa Honors Award is similar to the General Honors Award for students in Stillwater, consisting primarily of honors work within the student’s regular coursework. Some honors credit can be transferred from other institutions of higher learning. To meet the honors credit hour requirement for the award, students will engage in honors contracts with their professors. Honors contracts are a mechanism for adding an "honors dimension" to courses or sections that are not already deemed an honors course. These projects add an academic element to the course by introducing new material or by allowing the student to go into greater depth than normally required in some aspect of the course. “The honors contracts are a unique chance for faculty to help students dive into a subject they’re really interested in,” said Dr. Susan Johnson, associate provost and associate vice president for academic affairs at OSU-Tulsa. “These flexible projects are rewarding for both the student and the faculty member involved, and can take the form of in-depth research, a thoughtful presentation or a creative assignment.” A presentation for faculty to learn more about the award and how to navigate honors contracts at OSU-Tulsa will be hosted in North Hall 150 on April 27 from 3 to 4 p.m. Dr. Aditi Grover, OSU-Tulsa honors program coordinator and assistant professor of professional practice in the School of Marketing & International Business will lead the presentation alongside Beverly Morris, director of OSU-Tulsa academic advising. Students interested in pursuing the OSU-Tulsa Honors Award should contact Grover at aditi.grover@okstate.edu.
