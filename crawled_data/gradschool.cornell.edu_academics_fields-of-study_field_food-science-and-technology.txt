Candidates for the Ph.D. degree select one major in the field and two minors outside the field. There are no general course credit requirements for the M.S. or Ph.D. degrees. M.S. and Ph.D. degree candidates must make at least one research seminar presentation prior to graduation and are required to assist with the teaching program for at least one semester. In addition to the examinations required by the Graduate School, a qualifying examination is required of the M.S. and Ph.D. degree candidates before the start of their second semester of residence. M.P.S. degree candidates must meet the CALS credit requirements in addition to field requirements, which include a project presentation prior to graduation. All graduate students must take the field seminar (FDSC 6000) each term and Principles and Applications of Food Science and Technology (FDSC 6010) their first Fall semester. Excellent opportunities for graduate study in both basic and applied research are available. All course work is done on the Ithaca campus, but students may conduct their research at the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station at Geneva as well as on the Ithaca campus. In addition, the M.P.S. (Agriculture and Life Sciences) program has a Peace Corp option in which the student undertakes two semesters of academic work at Cornell and a Peace Corp assignment.

EDCs can cause detrimental health effects at very low concentration by affecting the endocrine system. There are emerging evidence that some EDCs could act on the thyroid hormone system affecting the development, or act as %u2018obesogens%u2019 by affecting adipogenesis and lipid metabolism. My laboratory investigates how these EDCs that are ubiquitously detected in our diet are affecting our health, especially at the critical stages of development and in the development of obesity. We use zebrafish embryos as high-throughput screening model to detect any endocrine disrupting effects in complex food matrices. We also utilize other whole animal models such as rodent and avian species, as well as in vitro cell culture models, to understand underlining mechanisms of endocrine disrupting effects of EDCs by molecular and histological techniques. In addition, we are interested in studying health effects of toxic compounds other than EDCs that are found in food and beverage products that are of potential health issues in the current food industry.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
