Swearer's Engaged Scholars Program (ESP) "enables students who are passionate about communities and the challenges they face to design courses of study and action as part of their concentration requirements. Through guided coursework, advising and hands-on experience working with community partners, students in ESP are able to contextualize abstract theories, challenge assumptions and develop skills that prepare them for lives of effective action." Archaeology ESP students will complete coursework in such topics as ethics, migration, and ethnography, participate in the Think Like an Archaeologist program, and complete a practicum in the Providence community or as part of summer fieldwork.
