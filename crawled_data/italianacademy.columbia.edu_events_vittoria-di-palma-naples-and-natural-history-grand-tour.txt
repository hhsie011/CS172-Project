She is the co-editor of Intimate Metropolis: Urban Subjects in the Modern City(Routledge: 2009) and her writing has also been published in AA Files, the Journal of Architecture, and the Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians. She is currently writing a book on landscape and natural history in 18th-century England. Prof. Di Palma specializes in modern European architectural history and theory, with a particular concentration on eighteenth-century architecture and landscape. Her research focuses on connections between landscape and epistemology; ideas of the natural and the artificial; and, more broadly, brings art historical issues to bear upon architectural history, examining, for example, ways in which visuality, aesthetics, and perception inform our understanding of buildings and environments.
