Our students perform independent research under the guidance of top faculty investigating a diverse range of questions in the sciences of molecular, cellular and developmental biology. MCDB Graduate Learning Goals Demonstrate comprehensive understanding of scholarly literature in the area of study. Form testable hypotheses and articulate research objectives that, when met, will lead to significant contributions to the field of study. Conduct qualitative and/or quantitative research via appropriate acquisition, analysis, and reporting of data. Interpret research results appropriately, integrating them into the existing knowledge in the discipline. Clearly and accurately communicate research findings orally and in writing, and often through the use images (tables, figures, and other forms of imagery) and electronic or other forms of media. Articulate how the graduate program, including coursework and creative scholarship, fits into life and career goals. Conduct scholarship, in teams or with independence, in ways that consistently demonstrate ethical practice and professionalism.
