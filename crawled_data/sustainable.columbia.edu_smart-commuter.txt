Sustainable Columbia defines a "Crown Commuter" as someone who chooses something other than a drive-alone commute to and from campus. Instead of driving alone, a Crown Commuter chooses a sustainable travel mode such as: Public transportation like subway, bus, or ferry Carpool or vanpool Walk Bike Park and ride Work or study from home 100% electric or plug-in hybrid electric car Any combination of the above A Crown Commuter must use a sustainable commute mode at least three times per week to qualify. Columbia understands the importance of doing what we can to reduce traffic congestion, increase travel efficiency, and mitigate our overall environmental impact. About one third of greenhouse gas emissions are derived from the transportation sector. This program encourages people to think about their commute and consider more sustainable and efficient travel modes, supporting the goals of Columbia’s Sustainability Plan. Those who don't currently qualify as a Crown Commuter can visit the Columbia Transportation website to find resources for choosing a new sustainable commute. Why designate as a Crown Commuter?
