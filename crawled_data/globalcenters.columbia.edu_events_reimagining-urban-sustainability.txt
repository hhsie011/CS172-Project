While urban dwellers show an increased predisposition towards bold environmental policies, thinning financial resources might render the cost of green transition unbearable to municipalities. This conference will offer insight into cities' capacity to implement a green recovery and explore the potential emerging forms of multilateral, multilevel, and multi-stakeholder partnerships. Welcoming remarks: Dr. Shannon Marquez, Dean of Global Engagement, Columbia University Chaired by : Professor Lorenzo Kihlgren Grandi Speakers: Dr. Paola Deda, Director of Forest, Land and Housing Division at the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Ms. Emmanuelle Pinault, Director of City Diplomacy, C40 Dr. Stefano Marta, Coordinator, Territorial Approach to the SDGs, OECD Q&A session facilitated by: Lou Garcia, Sciences Po graduate student This discussion is part of the Reimagining Cities series, co-organized by Sciences Po Paris School of International Affairs and Columbia Undergraduate Programs in Paris. Co-sponsored by the Alliance Program and Urban Flag. ABOUT THE SERIES Reimagining cities. Exploring global trends towards a new (urban) normal Hit hard by what was revealed to be primarily an urban pandemic, cities across the world have been harnessing the potential of their proximity with residents, the private sector, and civil society to deploy rapid, innovative, and cost-effective solutions. Most of this innovation is likely to continue as part of a broader movement led by numerous mayors committed to boldly re-direct urban development towards environmental sustainability, social equality, and resilience. Designed by Dr. Lorenzo Kihlgren Grandi, instructor of City Diplomacy at Sciences Po – PSIA, the École Polytechnique, and Columbia in Paris, this conference series aims at engaging distinguished mayors, scholars, practitioners, and students in a global discussion on the future of urban life in a post-pandemic world.
