On-Campus Work There are two types of on-campus student work available at Columbia University: (1) Federal Work-Study and (2) ‘casual’ positions. Federal Work-Study positions at Columbia can be found in a centralized database and are not available to all students (please see below for more information on eligibility). Casual opportunities have less restrictions but are not centralized in any database. To help you find these opportunities, we have listed on-campus departments that have been known to hire students. Since this is by no means a comprehensive list, we encourage you to also contact other departments that not listed below to inquire about casual work opportunities. Federal Work-Study Jobs (U.S. Citizens + permanent residents) For Work-Study opportunities, please visit Student Financial Services' Federal Work-Study Jobs Database. Please note that, in order to be eligible for Work-Study, you must be a United States citizen or permanent resident. For more information on Work-Study Eligibility, please click here. If you do not know your Work-Study status, you may check it on NetPartner. On-Campus ‘Casual’ Jobs Please carefully review and follow any instructions below or on the departments' respective websites for following up about on-campus work opportunities.
