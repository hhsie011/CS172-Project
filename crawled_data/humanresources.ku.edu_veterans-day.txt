Only those employees required to conduct necessary business should be requested to work. Eligibility All regular unclassified fiscal year faculty, academic staff, university support staff, and unclassified professional staff are eligible to observe Veterans Day and receive Holiday Credit. Holiday Compensation Policy If you are required to work on Veterans Day, compensation will be determined based on the following: Exempt (salaried) unclassified fiscal year faculty, academic staff, and professional staff required to work will receive equivalent time off (i.e., accruing holiday compensation at the rate of one hour for every hour worked). Non-exempt (hourly) and exempt (salaried) University Support Staff, and non-exempt (hourly) unclassified professional staff will receive holiday compensation at the rate of 1.5 hours for each hour worked. Additional Information Shared service representatives will contact supervisors of exempt employees to collect holiday hours worked and will submit to the HRM HR/Pay team for adjusting balances. Non-exempt (hourly) employees and their supervisors may wish to review item 17 for reporting work hours on a holiday in the following document: http://humanresources.ku.edu/document/guide-time-absence-reporting-document. The holiday credit should not be deleted unless the employee is not eligible for the holiday. Holiday credit may need to be added for eligible employees if hired after the process loaded the timesheet (~ a month in advance). For those in non-traditional work schedules, the holiday credit may be moved to a scheduled workday in the same work week.
