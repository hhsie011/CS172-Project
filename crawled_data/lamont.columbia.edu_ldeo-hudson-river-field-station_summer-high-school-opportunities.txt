Our high school students first take a deep dive into the Hudson River to develop a better understanding of the historic-to-present human connection to the estuary; the dynamism of its biology, physics, chemistry, geology, and topography; and the challenges the Hudson faces along with potential community solutions. Place-based field investigations build an appreciation for the estuary and environmental stewardship that participants can pass on to their communities. We also host speakers to talk about Hudson science; science communication; diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice (DEIJ) in science and environmental resource access; and community planning to embrace diversity. Students learn from the Hudson River through field work and data collection, and then work in teams to create their own communication tools designed to engage a diverse and multigenerational audience. In order to offer interesting and relevant information to their communities, students conduct interviews to learn directly from their friends, family, and neighbors about their perceptions and existing knowledge of the Hudson. Involving the community in place-based education is crucial because residents provide key information that is otherwise unknown to a visiting scientist or educator. Students then use this information to build communication tools that better connect all communities to their local waterways! A Voice of Unity is an extension of the program that looks to unite the voices of Rockland County by sharing the diverse stories, perspectives, and experiences that residents have had with the Hudson while building their knowledge. Students visit the five Rockland towns to learn from their communities about their diverse cultural relationships with the Hudson, then amplify these voices through filmed interviews integrated into a mini-film, annotated by the students, and showcased across the County. ELIGIBILITY: The Next Generation of Hudson River Educator Program is for historically underrepresented students in the sciences who are currently enrolled in high school. Student applicants must be at least 16 years old, and preferred current 10th, 11th, and 12th grade students. Honoraria are provided to high school participants. ‚úèÔ∏èAPPLY: The 2022 Next Generation of Hudson River Educators Program application is OPEN!
