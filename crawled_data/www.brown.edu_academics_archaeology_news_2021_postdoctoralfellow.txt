Exceptional junior scholars who can enhance and strengthen our commitment to inclusive education and research and to equality and social justice are encouraged to apply. We especially welcome applicants from historically underrepresented groups and those who identify with a particular ethnicity, race, class, gender, religion, or sexual orientation. We seek candidates who have demonstrated a capacity for innovative research, engaged scholarship, and cross-disciplinary thinking. We are interested in individuals whose work focuses on any region or time period, and who have significant fieldwork experience. Of particular interest are applicants working on environmental aspects of the ancient world in the broadest sense of the term and including human relationships to these, on topics such as landscape, climate change, pastoralism, agriculture, etc. Applicants must have normally received their doctorate from an institution other than Brown within the last five years, and the Ph.D. must be in hand prior to July 1, 2022. We fully understand and appreciate the impact that the current pandemic has had and continues to exert on our lives, personally and professionally, and we will regard ongoing research efforts and publication records in that light. In addition to pursuing their research, successful candidates will be expected to teach one course per semester. Teaching may be at both the undergraduate and graduate levels; interdisciplinary offerings are desirable. Successful candidates will be expected to make substantive contributions to the ongoing development of the Joukowsky Institute, through the organization of reading or working groups, a topical symposium, or another project intended to foster a stimulating intellectual environment in which to pursue research and to develop new interdisciplinary or community connections. This will be a two-year position, with confirmation after one year, beginning on July 1, 2022. Application Instructions All candidates should submit a letter of application, curriculum vitae, short descriptions of 3-4 proposed courses (150-300 words each), a statement (150-300 words) of their experience and/or ideas for prioritizing diversity and inclusion in their teaching and research, and contact information for three references by February 15, 2022.
