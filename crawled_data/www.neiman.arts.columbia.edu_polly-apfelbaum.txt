Inspired by an installation work presented at the Lodz Biennale in 2004, Apfelbaum selected a group of flags that represent revolutionary cultural and political movements throughout history. Some are highly recognizable images such as the Black Panther Party flag and LGBT pride rainbow spectrum while others are more obscure. To create a new system of symbols, Apfelbaum superimposed her own iconic pop flower shape on each flag. Apfelbaum (b. 1955) has lived and worked in New York City since 1978. She is primarily known for her colorful drawings, sculptures and fabric floor pieces. Apfelbaum’s work has been exhibited extensively in the United States and abroad and in 2004 was the focus of a mid-career survey initiated by the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia which travelled to the Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati and the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art, Kansas City. She has received numerous awards and honors including the Joan Mitchell Award, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and a Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant. Apfelbaum’s work is represented in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Israel Museum and the Yale University Art Gallery among others.
