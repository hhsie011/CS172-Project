Our long-standing expertise in family and household research highlights the importance of children’s health in relation to population health and demonstrates that the childhood origins of social inequality are immediately relevant to public policy about population-level inequality. PSTC researchers work to improve the welfare of children and families through the study of marriage, cohabitation, and fertility; childcare, adoption, and elder care; the impacts of education access and experience; intergenerational inequality; access to work; and life course health.
