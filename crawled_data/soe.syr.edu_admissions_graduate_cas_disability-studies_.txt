Overview Admissions & Financial Aid Program Requirements The Certificate of Advanced Study (C.A.S.) in Disability Studies program is internationally recognized and provides students a foundation to examine disability as a social, cultural, and political phenomenon. This program in the Department of Cultural Foundations of Education gives students the skills, methods, and perspectives to play leadership roles in disability research, policy, advocacy, and practice. It offers a variety of course formats and can be completed in person on campus, entirely online, or a combination of online and on campus classes. This variety of course formats gives students more opportunities and flexibility to engage in course work in Disability Studies. Graduate students from any department or school at Syracuse University can apply to the CAS in Disability Studies. In addition, although the program does not provide certification for clinical roles, many of our CAS students complete this program part time while also working and find an immediate benefit to their jobs and careers from this program. Recent graduates work in a diverse array of areas nationally and internationally including education, nonprofits and NGOs, law, government, and advocacy. Coursework in the CAS can also be transferred into a future M.S. or Ph.D. in Cultural Foundations of Education.
