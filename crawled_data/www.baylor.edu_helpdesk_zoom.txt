Additional features include two-way audio and video, text chat, application and desktop sharing, breakout rooms, and session recording for up to 300 participants per session. Availability Zoom is available for use by Baylor faculty, staff, and students through Canvas and directly through Baylor's Zoom website baylor.zoom.us. Accessibility Information (VPAT) Resources & Support (B) Video Retention Notice Zoom recordings are automatically deleted 180 days from the date of the meeting. Any recordings that are needed beyond 180 days must be downloaded manually and stored elsewhere outside of Zoom. Before Using Zoom Before setting up a Zoom meeting, please be aware of these important security measures. Avoid using your Personal Meeting ID (PMI) to host meetings. Every Zoom user is assigned a Personal Meeting ID that appears on your user profile. Anyone who knows or can discover your PMI can jump into meetings that you host with this ID. At Baylor, we disabled the ability to initiate meetings using your PMI by default. Keep your Meeting ID private. Every Zoom meeting has a 9-digit Meeting ID. If you share the Meeting ID on Twitter, Facebook, a web page, or other public media anyone will be able to attend your meeting. Password protect your meetings. Zoom meetings created using your Baylor Zoom account will be password protected by default. Do not de-select this option and be sure to share the password privately with those you invite. Use Zoom's Waiting Room feature. Waiting Rooms are enabled by default on our Zoom account. Meeting hosts must authorize attendees so that they can join a meeting. Guests in the Waiting Room will be marked as guests. Only allow people into the meeting that you invited. Restrict Screen Sharing. The host has the ability to restrict screen sharing during the meeting. This is a good idea that prevents people in the meeting from accidentally sharing their screen. The host can enable screen sharing as needed for particular participants. Lock the Meeting. Once all of your meeting attendees have arrived, you can lock the meeting to prevent anyone else from attending. Suspend Participant Activities. If your class is disrupted, hosts can instantly suspend the meeting to remove and report the offending party to prevent further disruption. Click the Security icon and select “Suspend Participant Activities” to halt all video, audio, in-meeting chat, annotation, screen sharing, and recording, and end Breakout Rooms.
