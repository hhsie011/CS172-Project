Integrating aspects of theatre, film, design, music, performance art and emerging technologies, students create original and adapted performance works through intensive and multi-dimensional collaboration. They graduate with specialized skills incorporating the emotional availability, creativity and transformational capacity of an actor, the athleticism and physical expression of a dancer, a choreographer’s eye for shape, movement and balance, a director’s sense of conceptualization, collaboration and leadership, a designer’s vision for sound, place, image and light, and a writer’s focus on language and story. They learn formal skills for successful collaboration, and train in processes for providing productive and meaningful feedback that make them highly sought-after following graduation.
