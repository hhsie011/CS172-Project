Advocacy exercises introduce skills critical to the practice of law. Competitions bring all of those elements together, enabling students to step into the shoes of a practicing attorney, counsel clients, draft agreements, negotiate deals, interview witnesses, make arguments, appeal decisions, and try cases all the way to final verdict. Under the watchful eyes of accomplished professors, practicing lawyers and sitting judges, Baylor students have the chance to go head to head with their peers—from here and around the country—to see how their skills stack up. Some competitions are required. Some are elective. Some students travel to face off against the top teams in the nation. Some even offer cash prizes. All offer students valuable, hands-on experiences that will make them more confident and capable advocates. WHY COMPETE? The practice of law is competitive. And whether aspiring lawyers find themselves squaring off against opposing counsel or competing against themselves to become the best lawyers they can be, having the skills necessary to overcome adversity, think strategically, argue convincingly and prevail on behalf of their client is crucial to success. For many students, it’s their first chance to be outside the classroom, to see if they have what it takes think and respond quickly and match wits against their classmates. One-on-one opportunities to work with professors over prolonged periods lead to a mastery of the nuts and bolts of oral and written skills—the very skills they will draw on while in Practice Court during their third year of law school. Competitive experiences translate into resume builders, as prospective employers look for young lawyers who have been tested. And in the end, students who face off against competition come away much better prepared for the challenges of real-world practice. ALL-IN FACULTY. Students who elect to compete soon discover that their coaches dedicate as much (if not more) time as they do—working side-by-side, one-on-one, nights and weekends—helping them formulate their strategies, polish their skills, craft their arguments, and prepare them for the competitions ahead. Few law schools, if any, offer the degree of full-time involvement—coaching and mentoring students throughout the rigors of competitions—as Baylor Law. ALL-OUT PREPARATION. Students also have access to some of the nation’s most accomplished litigators, sitting judges, transactional attorneys and written advocates—as Baylor Lawyers return as adjuncts—adding their insight and expertise to the preparation for competition. Working hand-in-hand with real-world experts, many of whom earned their spurs competing in these same competitions, it is not surprising that Baylor students enter tournaments with a distinct advantage. And that Baylor teams consistently place among the top ranked in America. ALL STAR ADVOCATES. Students who have tasted competition emerge with a core of confidence that only comes from having been tested under fire. Most come away with a newfound sense of what they’re made of, and more importantly, what they’re capable of doing. Having stepped up and continually delivered under pressure, they enter practice with the additional polish, precision, poise and resilience to become successful advocates. They know what to do. And, they know they can do it. “I have come back to judge mock trial competitions over the past few years. Watching students from other schools sometimes struggle with basic courtroom procedure and tactics drives home the point that Baylor Law provides a high quality learning experience not duplicated in any other academic setting I have seen.” —The Honorable Aleta Hacker Judge, 326th District Court Academics Academic Calendar Academic Services Advocacy Top Gun National Mock Trial Competition 2021 Top Gun XII Top Gun XI - How We Did It 2020 Top Gun XI 2019 Top Gun X 2018 Top Gun Competition 2017 Top Gun Competition 2016 Top Gun Competition 2015 Top Gun Competition Transactional Practice Ready Transactional Courses Professional Tracks & Capstones Transactional Dual Degree Programs Transactional Faculty Transactional Law & Practice Court Legal Writing Business Law Boot Camp The Closer National Transactional Law Competition 2023 | The Closer 2022 | The Closer 2021 | The Closer 2020 | The Closer 2019 | The Closer 2018 | The Closer 2017 | The Closer In House Counsel Externship Program Competition Opportunities and Results for Current Students Transactional Law Mentorship Program Degree Programs Executive LL.M. in Litigation Management Baylor Law Learning Outcomes Experiential Learning Practice Court Program Legal Clinics Entrepreneurship Clinic Estate Planning Clinic Immigration Clinic IP Law Clinic Trial Advocacy Clinic Veterans Clinic Transactional Capstones Public Service Baylor Law's Pro Bono and Public Service Program Adoption Day People's Law School People's Law School | 2022 People's Law School 2022 Class Schedule People's Law School 2022 Survey People's Law School | 2021 Service Opportunities for Law Students Waco McLennan Pro Bono Challenge Waco McLennan Pro Bono Challenge Hours Recording Form Waco McLennan Pro Bono Challenge Sign-up Waco McLennan Outstanding Pro Bono Advocate Awards DAYL Pro Bono Challenge DAYL Pro Bono Challenge Hours Recording Form DAYL Pro Bono Challenge Sign-Up DAYL Pro Bono Annual Challenge Results DAYL Pro Bono Partners Service Award Resources Student Awards Competitions Intramural Opportunities Intermural Opportunities Externships Leadership Development Program Legal Mapmaker Legal Mapmaker Program Payment Study Abroad Legal Writing Integrated Approach Writing Courses Writing Faculty The Ultimate Writer Competition The Paper Chase Legal Writing Competition Study Abroad at St Andrews Baylor Law Review Show More General Information Colleges, Schools, Libraries & Research Admissions Administration Gateways For...
