Bradbury Award Made possible by a gift from the Clemson Class of 1940, the Douglas W. Bradbury Award recognizes a faculty member who has made outstanding contributions to the Clemson University Honors College. Nominations may be made by senior Honors students, faculty, and department chairs or other academic administrators. Awards Presentation The presentation of the Douglas W. Bradbury Award is made at the Clemson University Honors College Spring Awards Ceremony in May. Questions? For more information about the Honors Faculty Awards program, please contact the Honors College at 864-656-4762 or email Jenny Wirtz. Nomination Process How to Nominate a Faculty Member Nominators should complete the online nomination form to nominate a deserving faculty member by March 15, 2022. Nominators are not asked to submit a letter along with their nomination; however, the faculty member may, at his or her discretion, specifically ask the nominator to write one of their letters of support. The Honors College will notify nominees of their nomination via email and will also provide a submission packet for the nominee to complete. Full submission packets, including the below materials, are due to the Honors College by April 1, 2022. In support of their candidacy, nominees are asked to submit the following materials: A current curriculum vitae A statement of no more than two pages summarizing the nominee's involvement in and service to the Clemson University Honors College, addressing the evaluation areas detailed below A sample Honors course syllabus (if appropriate) No more than three supporting letters, at least two of which must be from Honors students; letters must be submitted to Jenny Wirtz (jwirtz@clemson.edu) by the submission deadline Nominations remain active for three years. Evaluation Process In selecting the recipient of the Douglas W. Bradbury Award, the Clemson University Honors College Committee will assess nominees in each of the following areas, giving preference to candidates who exhibit breadth and depth in their contributions to the Honors College and Honors students: Involvement in the development and teaching of Honors courses Involvement as an Honors thesis/project advisor Service to the Honors College (e.g., departmental liaison, member of the CUHCC, Honors College application reviewer, member of other Honors College committee) Service to Honors students as mentor/advisor (e.g., Dixon Fellows senior fellow, EUREKA! mentor, Honors College study abroad faculty member, advisor/mentor to Honors students or organizations affiliated with the Honors College) Although candidates need not contribute in all areas, the strongest candidates will demonstrate exemplary contributions in more than one area. Nominees and references are strongly encouraged to address the evaluation criteria in their materials. The committee will only consider materials and information presented in the nomination packet. If in the judgment of the Clemson University Honors College Committee none of the nominees meet these criteria, no award shall be made. Previous Award Recipients Douglas W.
