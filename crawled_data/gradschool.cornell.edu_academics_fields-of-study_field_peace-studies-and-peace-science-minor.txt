The peace science concentration emphasizes mathematical modeling and game-theoretic models, while the peace studies concentration emphasizes historical, institutional, and policy-oriented approaches. The minor concentrations are intended to complement basic study in such fields as government, history, anthropology, public affairs, industrial and labor relations, agricultural economics, city and regional planning, civil and environmental engineering, economics, operations research, psychology, sociology, and science and technology studies. Requirements: Students are required to complete at least two semesters of the Proseminar in Peace Studies (GOVT/HIST/STS 7937), a two-credit course typically offered each semester of the regular academic year. As described in the Courses of Study catalog, the Proseminar in Peace Studies offers a multidisciplinary review of issues related to peace and conflict at the graduate level. The course is led by the director of the Judith Reppy Institute for Peace and Conflict Studies and is based on the Institute's weekly seminar series, featuring outside visitors and Cornell faculty. Additionally, students pursuing research degrees are required to include a member of the minor field on their special committee, while those pursuing professional degrees are required to have an advisor drawn from the minor field. Students pursuing research degrees should specify the concentration represented by that committee member (either peace studies or peace science) when forming their special committee with the graduate school. The committee member representing the peace studies or peace science concentration is then responsible for certifying completion of the minor to the graduate school. Students pursuing professional degrees should ask their advisor in the minor field to certify that the student has met the minor requirements to the Director of Graduate Studies (who is also the Director of the Institute); the DGS and minor coordinator will then certify completion of the minor to the registrar for that student’s degree-granting program (e.g. the Cornell Institute for Public Affairs). Note that each member of a student’s committee can represent only one concentration for that particular committee. Hence, an advisor cannot represent the peace studies or peace science concentration on a student’s committee while simultaneously representing a different concentration on the committee (for example, the international relations concentration within the government major), even though the advisor may be a member of both fields and concentrations. In such cases, students may add additional committee members to specifically represent the peace studies or peace science concentration.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
