Student Testimonials “At the time I was looking for a program, there weren't many that would focus on and be applicable to my field--I teach science and STEM. I really liked the course descriptions I read online and I knew I didn't want to spend money and time learning about stuff that was too general or not applicable to my practice. The fact that UC had a track that enabled me to earn graduate certification in STEM along with my MEd was also very important to me. Also, I really liked the "Student Success Coordinator" aspect of the UC online system--a person with whom I could (and did!) build a relationship, who served as my academic enrollment specialist and was available to answer any and all questions I had throughout my time as a student. Finally, I found the UC faculty and staff to be without exception responsive, supportive, forward-thinking, professional experts in their field. The structure, administration, and content of the program combined with the excellent UC faculty and staff made the whole experience worth every penny and moment of time I spent.” Amy B.
