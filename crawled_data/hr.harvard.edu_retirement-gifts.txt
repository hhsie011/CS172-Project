Showing appreciation for a decade or even a career spent at Harvard is a positive part of our workplace culture. Harvard policy (Harvard Key required) provides guidance about such celebrations and gifts. Finding an appropriate, Harvard-branded retirement gift that conforms to University policy – and to the IRS limit for tax exempt "longer service" gifts, which is $400 – has sometimes been a challenge. To make it easier, Harvard Human Resources has partnered with M.LaHart & Co. to create a retirement gifts portal at: https://huretirementshop.mlahart.com/. M.LaHart & Co. is known for its collection of fine quality university-branded gifts and has been a Harvard licensee for over 20 years. Harvard departmental and human resources admininistrators are invited to create a personalized account on the site to browse and purchase retirement gifts for faculty and staff. After a quick review by Harvard Human Resources, your account will be activated. Like other e-commerce sites, you'll be able to select from many gift choices, specify engraving and shipping location. You may pay with a corporate card or request that an invoice be sent to you for payment by Harvard. Regardless of payment method, you will need to provide the name and the first four digits of the HUID of the faculty or staff member retiring when ordering online, to fully substantiate this expense. Once done, no other reporting or paperwork is required. (All gift purchases will be subject to audit by Harvard.) M.LaHart's Connecticut-based customer service team is ready to assist with any questions you might have. Please contact Mary Skoog at mskoog@mlahart.com or 1-800-551-4715.
