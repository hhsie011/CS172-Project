Brown Affiliations Engineering On the Web Group webpage on GitHub Google Scholar Research Research Statement My research focuses on the formulation of new continuum-level constitutive theories for describing material behavior and the quantitative modeling of material behavior through numerical simulation. I am particularly interested in materials that exhibit coupled and size-dependent phenomena. Some areas of ongoing research include: 1. Constitutive models for flow and size-segregation in dense granular materials. 2. Large-deformation, viscoelastic constitutive modeling of elastomeric foams. 3. Modeling of wave propagation and electromechanical instabilities in dielectric elastomer composites. 4. Modeling of inertial microcavitation in soft materials.
