Bell Graduate Faculty Excellence In Mentoring Award The delicate balance of mentoring someone is not creating them in your own image but giving them the opportunity to create themselves. - Steven Spielberg Mentoring is an important aspect of graduate education and most will agree that a successful faculty-graduate student mentoring relationship fosters student success. Providing support for graduate students through mentoring can assure that students are well trained in their disciplines, able to successfully complete their degrees, have appropriate development of professional skills, and have increased employment opportunities after graduation. Students who have mentors are more involved in their academic programs and the university, are more productive and are generally more satisfied with their programs. The Graduate School at Texas Tech University has created the Nancy J. Bell Faculty Excellence in Mentoring Award to recognize those mentors who have gone above and beyond in mentoring graduate students. This award was designed to allow graduate students and/or faculty to nominate Texas Tech University faculty mentors who they believe embody the spirit of a great mentor and have helped them on their educational journey. The winning faculty member will receive $1,000 to be utilized for travel or research purposes. The nomination form is currently closed.
