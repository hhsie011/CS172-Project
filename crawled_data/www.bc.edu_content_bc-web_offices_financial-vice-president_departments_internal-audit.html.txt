Blanchette Senior Auditor 617-552-3343 michelle.blanchette@bc.edu Timothy Roche Senior IT Auditor 617-552-1268 timothy.roche@bc.edu Business Ethics Hotline Sound business conduct requires that each employee, as a basic condition of employment, assume responsibility for safeguarding and preserving the assets and resources of the University, particularly those for which he or she is responsible. In accordance with the University Professional Standards and Business Conduct Policy, each University employee is expected to report any instance of suspected ethical misconduct to the Director of Internal Audit. If presented with reasonable evidence of a suspected ethical misconduct, the Director of Internal Audit will conduct an audit to determine if the reported suspicions of fraud are valid. Situations may arise when an individual discovers or reasonably suspects unethical or illegal behavior and yet may be reluctant to report it for fear of reprisal or retaliation. Accordingly, Boston College has selected EthicsPoint, a third-party vendor, to provide an anonymous Ethics Hotline. EthicsPoint will facilitate confidential and anonymous reporting of concerns about any aspect of University compliance, through either a direct telephone call or an online intake process. 855-327-4477 Submit an Anonymous Report More Info About Internal Audit For BC community members Contact intaud@bc.edu Directions Back To Top Back To Top Office of the Financial Vice President & Treasurer 129 Lake St., Suite 540 Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 617-552-4191 About Departments Accessibility Emergency Contact Notice of Nondiscrimination Copyright Â© 2022 Trustees of Boston College
