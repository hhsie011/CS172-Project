Students may apply to only one program per term. If you are applying to an Approved or Petition program, you must complete both an OIP application in Via TRM and the application for the program provider, whose deadlines may differ from the OIP application deadlines below. Please refer to the program provider website for information about their application deadlines. Applications for Brown and Consortium for Advanced Studies Abroad (CASA) programs are processed on a rolling admissions basis. Early applications are highly encouraged. It is best to apply early to an Approved or Petition program because many program providers accept applications on a rolling admissions basis. If you are considering an Approved or Petition Program, we recommend that you apply as soon as possible, even if you have not yet received study abroad approval from Brown. Please view specific program deadlines by term below: Fall 2022/Year 2022-2023 Deadlines Spring 2022 Deadlines Please note: The Brown deadlines above are for application to study abroad, not for admission to Brown University.
