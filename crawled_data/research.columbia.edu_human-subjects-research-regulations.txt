These revisions became effective in 2018, so although the general compliance date was advanced to January 21, 2019, the regulations are referred to as the "Pre-2108 Requirements" and the "2018 Requirements." As the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not yet revised its regulations, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) has not signed onto the revised Common Rule, the Pre-2018 Requirements currently apply to research that is FDA-regulated or DOJ-supported. The general compliance date for the Revised Common Rule is January 21, 2019. 2018 Requirements 2018 Requirements: 45 CFR 46 - Protection of Human Subjects The term "2018 Requirements" refers to the Common Rule as published in the July 19, 2018 edition of the e-Code of Federal Regulations. The 2018 Requirements were originally published on January 19, 2017 and further amended on January 22, 2018 and June 19, 2018. The 2018 Requirements may also be referred to as the “2018 Rule” and the "revised Common Rule."

The pre-2018 Requirements were originally promulgated in 1991, and subsequently amended in 2005. The pre-2018 Requirements may also be referred to as the “pre-2018 Rule” and the "pre-2018 Common Rule."
