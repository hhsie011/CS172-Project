Minimally Invasive Procedures (MIPs) provide improved outcomes, reduced anesthesia times, reduced hospital stays and feasible treatment options for conditions that previously had none. Types of Minimally Invasive Procedures Interventional Endoscopy utilizes endoscopic equipment to guide diagnosis and treatment in virtually all organ systems. Some of the common conditions treated with IE include urinary tract infections, incontinence, kidney stones, and various tumors. Interventional Radiology employs various advanced imaging modalities such as CT, MRI, fluoroscopy and ultrasound to guide diagnosis and treatment of conditions virtually anywhere within the body. OSU-VMH is currently the only provider of High-Frequency Focused Ultrasound to treat tumors and medically non-responsive infections in veterinary medicine. We believe this innovative treatment will revolutionize the treatment of cancer in animals. Minimally Invasive Surgery includes laparoscopy, thoracoscopy, arthroscopy and minimally-invasive fracture repairs such as external fixators. BEFORE: Tux came to the OSU Veterinary Medical Hospital with a large amount of fluid in his abdomen due to a severed narrowing of the caudal vena cava, a major vessel. AFTER: Tux responded well to his MIP. Notice his abdomen is no longer swollen. He is expected to live a normal, happy life!
