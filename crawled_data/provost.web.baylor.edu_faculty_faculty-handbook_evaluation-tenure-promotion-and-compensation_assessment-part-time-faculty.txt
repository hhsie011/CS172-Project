In order to execute this evaluation, chairs, deans, or program directors review course evaluation results and any other applicable information (including other teaching-related duties that may be assigned) for each part-time faculty member and record their conclusions on the Evaluation of Part-Time Faculty Instruction worksheet. A copy of this worksheet is submitted to the dean each semester, and the chair or dean, as appropriate, takes subsequent action—declining to offer future employment in cases in which a negative conclusion has been reached, and addressing matters of concern through discussions with the faculty member and remedial processes as indicated.
