Box 750436 Dallas, TX 75275-0436 The Multicultural Greek Council's Mission Statement "Provide a forum that allows for the free exchange of ideas, programs, and services between its constituent fraternities and sororities; to promote the awareness of multicultural diversity within collegiate institutions, their surrounding communities, and the greater community-at-large, and to support and promote the works of its member organizations." MGC seeks to: Promote the interests of the University, which include scholarship, leadership and citizenship. Promote the interests and unity of the Greek organizations represented on campus. Promote the interests of college fraternities and sororities in general, which includes the consideration that they are viable and valuable collegiate experiences. Facilitate communication and cooperation between member fraternities and the University administration and faculty. What makes MGC organization’s unique? MGC organizations were founded to support and celebrate student populations from culturally diverse backgrounds. The Multicultural Greek Council is a coalition of perspectives and identities. By nature, it requires membership to examine themselves, make space for peers, and enhance everyone's capacity to engage across the campus community. MGC Recruitment Current MGC Organizations at SMU Upcoming MGC Events The Multicultural Greek Council and the National Pan-Hellenic Council Garden The National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) was founded in 1930 and established at SMU in 1986, and the Multicultural Greek Council (MGC) was founded in 1998 and established at SMU in 2000. Both councils continue to thrive on the SMU campus and have been a driving force for all of the student body by breaking down barriers and fostering leadership opportunities throughout the institution. The presence of these two Greek governing councils at SMU has been an important aspect of the University’s support for our diverse student body. To recognize their contributions and ensure a lasting legacy for generations of SMU students to come, SMU has created a garden in honor of the Multicultural Greek Council and National Pan-Hellenic Council. Situated at the corner of University Boulevard and Airline Road, the garden is comprised of individual stone markers for each fraternity and sorority chapter that is a member of each council, signifying the enduring impact these organizations have made on the University.
