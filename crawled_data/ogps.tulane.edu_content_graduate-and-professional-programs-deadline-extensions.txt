Four students received Master of Arts degrees in 1885, and the first Doctor of Philosophy was conferred in 1887. In the ensuing years, graduate program offerings continued to develop under several different names and forms of administration. In 1925, the Faculty of Graduate Studies became the Graduate School. With the renewal of the university in 2006, all graduate program administration returned to the respective schools and the Graduate School was closed. Today, graduate studies are administered by the deans of the schools. At the departmental level, the graduate chair is responsible for the administration of graduate affairs. The Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies (OGPS) opened in 2012.
