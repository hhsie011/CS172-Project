The degree includes 81 units in the major, 24 General Education units, 15 units of electives and all university requirements. When selecting courses, students need to consult with a faculty adviser. Course prerequisites are strictly enforced. All required courses toward the degree must be taken for a letter grade. All required mathematics and science courses must be passed with a “C-” (1.7) or better. Graduate courses are not open to undergraduate students without department approval. A GPA of 2.0 or better is required for the major. Mathematics and Science Courses (30 units) CHEM 123 - Chemistry for Engineers (3) MATH 150A - Calculus I (4) MATH 150B - Calculus II (4) MATH 250A - Calculus III (4) MATH 250B - Introduction to Linear Algebra and Differential Equations (4) PHYS 225 - Fundamental Physics: Mechanics (3) PHYS 225L - Fundamental Physics: Laboratory (1) PHYS 226 - Fundamental Physics: Electricity and Magnetism (3) PHYS 226L - Fundamental Physics: Laboratory (1) EGCE 308 - Engineering Analysis (3) Introductory Engineering Courses (9 units) EGCE 201 - Statics (3) EGCE 302 - Dynamics (3) EGCE 401 - Engineering Economics and Professionalism (3) General Education Courses All students at Cal State Fullerton are expected to complete prescribed units of General Education that are made up of courses outside of their chosen disciplines. Students seeking a degree in Engineering have been provided exceptions from some of the General Education requirements. For this reason, it is important that students take the approved G.E. courses for Engineering majors that are found in their Titan Degree Audit (TDA). Additionally, they should confirm the G.E. courses that are required within their specific programs with their respective advisers. Upper-Division Writing Requirement Six units from the following courses are required and must be passed with a “C” (2.0) or better.
