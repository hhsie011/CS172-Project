This walk concentrates on the women who frequented Montparnasse and the neighboring Luxembourg Gardens, including Gertrude Stein, Josephine Baker, and Simone de Beauvoir. Tour led by Dr. Monique Y. Wells. Meeting Point: Reid Hall End Point: Luxembourg Gardens Language: English Dr. Monique Y. Wells is a native of Houston, Texas and a 29-year resident of Paris. She and her husband, Tom Reeves, founded their travel business—which was originally called Discover Paris!—in 1999. In 2018, they narrowed their focus and rebranded as Entrée to Black Paris (ETBP) tours because of the consistently increasing demand for tours and activities that feature the history, culture, and contemporary life of African Americans and the larger African diaspora in Paris. Writer of the multi-award-winning Entrée to Black Paris blog, Dr. Wells created twelve of ETBP’s 13 walking tours. She was named an Outstanding Woman in Travel Research by Women in Travel and Tourism International in 2017 and 2020. She is the U.S. Delegate for the Académie de l’Art Culinaire du Monde Créole (Academy of Culinary Art for the Creole World). And she is the creator of Paris - An Afro-centric Perspective, the only continuing education course for travel professionals that features African diaspora Paris. Dr. Wells created the Paris Was a Woman walking tour as part of her work to uncover the stories of the women who contributed to Paris’ rich cultural landscape and yet are often forgotten in the discourse of the city’s history.
