We continue to work closely with health authorities to manage the University response to the pandemic. Academic Calendar Spring 2022 Updates As we prepare to return to campus for the spring semester, we continue to implement ways to protect your health and that of our community. During the last month, there has been a surge in COVID-19 cases from the rapidly spreading Omicron variant across our region and the country. Unfortunately, NYC is reporting a 32% positivity rate. Personal Wellness: If you have symptoms of COVID-19 or have tested positive for COVID-19, do not come to campus. Please complete the COVID-19 Notification Form and consult with a healthcare provider. Booster Requirement: All students and employees are required to get a booster before January 19, 2022, or as soon as they are eligible. Getting your vaccine booster is the best protection against the Omicron variant. Per the CDC, everyone ages 18 and older should get a booster shot. We are requiring all students and employees to get their booster shot (6 months after their initial Pfizer or Moderna series or 2 months after their initial J&J vaccine). NYC Vaccine Finder provides resources to schedule vaccine and booster appointments and locate walk-in clinics. For those outside of NYC, please visit Vaccines.gov for information on locating a COVID-19 booster dose. Employees are entitled to up to four hours of paid leave to receive booster shots. When you have received your COVID-19 booster dose, please upload proof into Medicat (view instructions). Isolation/Quarantine Guidelines New York State recently updated its guidance on isolation and quarantine to align with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revised protocols. St. John’s has adopted much of the New York State’s updated guidance, which you may view at Isolation/Quarantine Protocols, It is important to understand the difference between isolation and quarantine: Isolation is for individuals who have been infected with COVID-19 even if they don't have symptoms. You isolate in order to prevent spreading the virus to others. Quarantine is for someone who has been exposed to the COVID-19 virus but has not tested positive for COVID-19 and does not have symptoms. Quarantine is important because even before a person has tested positive for COVID-19 or has any symptoms, they can spread the virus without knowing. If you test positive for COVID-19, please complete the COVID-19 Notification Form. Students that reside on campus will be moved to isolation spaces. Students that reside off-campus must isolate in their own residence. Employees must isolate in their own residence. Having our employees and students fully vaccinated with the booster will enable us to more safely engage in campus events, programs, and activities. We appreciate your cooperation in making these changes. Updates We will continue to assess our COVID-19 protocols throughout the semester, in collaboration with local health authorities from the New York City and New York State Departments of Health as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and will adjust as needed throughout the semester. Please note: NYS no longer specifies or mandates a case count threshold for determining whether or not a higher education institution should enact online learning.

In addition, all employees be fully vaccinated by September 30, 2021. Employees who believe that they are eligible for a medical or religious exemption from the vaccine requirement must apply to the Office of Human Resources’ Employee Benefits Department no later than September 3, 2021. Anyone who has been granted medical or religious exemptions, or anyone in process of completing full vaccination, will be required to complete daily symptom monitoring, report for regular testing, wear masks on University-managed properties, and comply with other protocols applicable to those who have not been vaccinated. Under New York City law, Unvaccinated students arriving to St. John’s from international destinations need to take additional steps that include a 7-day arrival quarantine.

Masking Click to Open From the earliest days of the onset of the COVID-19 global pandemic in February 2020, the guiding principle for decision-making at the University has been to follow local, state, and federal public health guidelines. On Sunday, February 27, New York State Governor Kathy Hochul announced an end to the statewide indoor mask mandate in schools effective Wednesday, March 2. Shortly after that statewide policy update, New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced that he plans to lift the mask order for New York City schools and also announced that beginning Monday, March 7, the city’s Key2NYC requirement that businesses confirm vaccination status for indoor dining, indoor fitness, and indoor entertainment will be lifted. These decisions follow new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention saying most people do not need to wear face coverings in indoor public settings unless there is a high level of severe disease. With protection from immunity rising—both from vaccination and infection—the overall risk of severe COVID-19 is now generally lower. Effective Monday, March 7 masks are no longer required anywhere at St. John’s University either for indoor or outdoor campus activities. Those with vaccine exemptions must wear a mask while on any St. John's University campus or location. People may still choose to wear masks at any time. Anyone on campus or visiting campus is welcome to wear a mask anywhere, if they feel safer doing so, and those personal and individual decisions demand our mutual respect and support. We need to remember that we have members of our community who feel vulnerable because of their own health conditions or those of their family. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 or have tested positive for COVID-19, you should not come to campus. Please complete the COVID-19 Notification Form and consult with a health-care provider. If you are exposed to a person with COVID-19, you are required to wear a mask at all times when around others, and you need to be tested 5 days after the exposure. It is important that we make decisions in the collective interests of the greater campus community following local, state, and federal public health guidelines and considering conditions on campus and in our surrounding communities. All of our COVID-19 planning and protocols are subject to the latest public health guidelines and may be modified as circumstances change. Having our employees and students fully vaccinated and boosted enable us to safely engage in more robust campus events, programs, and activities. Together, we have worked as a community to confront the many unexpected and enduring challenges presented to us by the pandemic. The University’s preparedness and responses for living, learning, and working during the pandemic helped to form a stronger, nimbler St. John’s—a community better able to maintain our business operations and to serve our students in a safe and healthy environment. Since our founding in 1870, St. John’s University has endured through periods of great adversity and emerged from these challenges stronger while remaining faithful to our Catholic and Vincentian mission. We pray for all those impacted by the far-reach of the COVID-19 pandemic. The University’s successful response to the pandemic is measured by small but meaningful contributions made by so many members of the St. John’s community. We appreciate your cooperation and compliance regarding all our campus safety protocols as, with great anticipation, we look forward to the return of our students for the duration of the Spring 2022 semester. Testing Click to Open During the spring 2022 semester, the University will conduct both entry testing and community surveillance testing for COVID-19. If you need assistance with on-campus COVID-19 testing services, please contact [email protected]. Students and employees will be selected for community surveillance testing throughout the semester. When a person is selected to participate in community testing, they will be notified via the St. John's Connect app and their St. John’s email. Those who have been granted an exemption to the University’s vaccination requirement are required to provide weekly COVID-19 test results on their own. Failure to comply with this requirement may result in a temporary denial of access to campus until testing compliance has been re-established and/or a revocation of the granted exemption Spring 2022 Health Service Office Hours Student Health Services on the Queens Campus and Staten Island Campus are being centralized; call 718-990-6360, during the following hours: Queens Office, DaSilva Hall Mondays – Thursdays, 8:30 a.m. – 4:30 p.m. Fridays, 8:30 a.m. – 3 p.m. Footer CTA Visit Give Request Info News Events Admission SignOn (UIS, Email, Blackboard, MS) St. John's Connect Notice of Non-Discrimination, Equal Opportunity Locations Queens Staten Island Manhattan Rome Paris Limerick Resources Safety Information Security and Compliance Employers [email protected] John's Faculty & Staff Directory Human Resources Policies Webmail For Students Career Services Academic Calendar Bookstore Title IX Office of the Registrar Contact Us Admission: 718-990-2000 8000 Utopia Parkway, Queens, NY 11439 Choose Language Select LanguageEnglishAfrikaansAlbanianArabicArmenianAzerbaijaniBasqueBelarusianBengaliBosnianBulgarianCatalanCebuanoCroatianCzechDutchEsperantoEstonianFilipinoFinnishFrenchGalicianGeorgianGermanGreekGujaratiHaitian CreoleHausaHebrewHindiHmongHungarianIcelandicIgboIndonesianIrishItalianJapaneseJavaneseKannadaKhmerKoreanLaoLatinLatvianLithuanianMacedonianMalayMalteseMaoriMarathiMongolianNepaliPersianPolishPortuguesePunjabiRomanianSerbianSlovakSlovenianSomaliSpanishSwahiliTamilTeluguThaiTurkishUkrainianUrduVietnameseWelshYiddishYorubaZulu Facebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn YouTube TikTok © 2022 St. John's University.
