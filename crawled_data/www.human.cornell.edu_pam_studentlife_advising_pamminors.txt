General Information Each minor is open to all Cornell University undergraduates (other than PAM and HCP majors). Students must choose one minor, they cannot complete all. Keeping track of courses required and completed is the student’s responsibility. Students will not be assigned a Brooks School advisor. In order to receive preference for enrollment in PAM courses that are at course limits, complete the Intention to_Minor in_PAM form. Submit the form to Jen Wright (jrd292@cornell.edu) using the Secure File Transfer, any time after you have completed at least one of the minor requirements. Unfortunately, formally declaring intent to minor does not guarantee that a student will be able to take a given Brooks course in a given semester. During the semester in which you are planning to graduate: Submit a copy of the Application to Graduate with a Minor in Policy Analysis and Management Form to the Undergraduate Program Coordinator, Jen Wright (jrd292@cornell.edu) using the Secure File Transfer. After verifying that you have completed all of the requirements for the minor, your college registrar will be notified, and your final transcript will indicate that you earned a minor in Policy Analysis and Management or Health Policy.
