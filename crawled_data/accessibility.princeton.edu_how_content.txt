Content Accessibility Checklist Pictures are for puppies, not for paragraphs. Avoid images of text. Alternative text describes what the image means in this particular context. Color contrast is checked with eyedropper tools. Headings, lists and table header tags make pages navigable. Meaningful links work out of context, unlike click here to learn more. Language switches need tags, or "Español" becomes "A Spaniel." Instructions should not depend on color alone (in green) or sensory characteristics (left column). Video and audio need accurate closed captions or transcripts PDF documents should be deleted out of love for mobile and screen reader users. New designs should be checked with automatic tools, mobile phones and real devices. Footer Accessibility © 2022 The Trustees of Princeton University
