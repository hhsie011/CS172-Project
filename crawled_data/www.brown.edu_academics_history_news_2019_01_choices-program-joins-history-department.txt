Founded in 1988 at the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, Choices was conceived as part of an initiative to engage the U.S. public in considering contested international policy issues. Under the leadership of founding director Susan Graseck, the Choices Program expanded its focus to create curriculum content on international policy, world history, and U.S. history. Today, Choices curricula is used by more than one million students annually in all 50 states and over 200 international school and considered a leader in supplementary social studies curriculum.

Choices is beginning a new era with an exciting partnership with the department under the leadership of a rotating Faculty Director from History. Last summer, Graseck left her position as director of Choices and began her retirement. “I leave knowing that the work of Choices is in good hands, not only with its dedicated staff and faculty at Brown but with the universities, school district leaders, teachers, civic engagement programs, and foundations across the country with whom we have worked closely for many years.” Choices will continue its work on critical international policy issues and current events, but the new partnership with History means that it will be able to broaden its geographical diversity and deepen its temporal range. New units under discussion include: a history of race and the Middle Ages, a global history of incarceration, and an examination of slavery in the Americas that focuses on the experiences of enslaved people. Building on the program’s three decades of experience in curriculum development, History faculty expertise on Africa, East Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia, North America, and Europe will add a significant new dimension to Choices curriculum offerings. The inaugural Choices Faculty Director is Associate Professor Naoko Shibusawa. In her new role as director, Shibusawa is enthusiastic about building on Choices’ strengths and “empowering students to use the past more mindfully.” The partnership with Choices, she says, “will help all of us think of ways to study and teach the past in order to imagine a better future.” Explore Brown University Search Brown Show/Hide Learn More About Brown Academics Admission Research Campus Life Find A to Z Index People Directory Information for Students Faculty Staff Families Alumni Friends & Neighbors Top Destinations Global Brown Watson Institute Graduate School Alpert Medical School School of Public Health School of Engineering Contact Department of History Department of History Brown University Box N 79 Brown Street Providence, RI 02912 Phone: 401-863-2131 Email [email protected] Twitter Twitter Facebook Facebook Giving to Brown Brown University Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA Phone: 401-863-1000 Maps & Directions / Contact Us / Accessibility © 2022 Brown University Connect: [email protected] Facebook Twitter YouTube Instagram iTunes U LinkedIn SnapChat
