Texas Tech University Directory Raiderlink A-Z Index Financial Aid Menu Search TTU Financial Aid Home Special Circumstances We understand that circumstances may arise where your family's financial situation may be jeopardized creating challenges in financing your education. Should this be the case, please complete the Special Circumstances Form which can be found below. Please note that this application should only be completed if your family's financial situation has significantly changed from the previous calendar year to the current calendar year. Learn more below. The primary reason for a special circumstance is to make qualifying adjustments to the family adjusted gross income which may lower a student's Expected Family Contribution (EFC). In some instances, this adjustment will assist in qualifying the student for grant funding. If the student's EFC is already 0, there is no reason to submit a Special Circumstance. <!-- intentionally non-empty iframe; for xsl --> Reasons for submitting a special circumstance include: Loss of employment - If the year to date income is equal to or more than the previous year income, no changes can be made for loss of employment. Separation or divorce - Changes can only be made if both parent/stepparent income was included on the FAFSA and a separation or divorce occurred after the FAFSA was submitted. Loss of child support - Changes can only be made if child support was included on the FAFSA. Medical Death of a spouse or parent - Changes can only be made if income of the deceased was included on the FAFSA. Deduction of one-time payment - Consumer debt cannot be considered.
