What is the universe made of, how does it work, and why is it so huge? What is the nature of space and space time? What is dark matter? And can the theory of quantum mechanics be reconciled with gravity? To address these theoretical challenges, SITP fosters a collaborative culture where scientists reach beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries and take sweeping intellectual leaps. This open, interactive environment has made SITP a world leader in the following fields: The Precision Frontier: Beyond the Standard Model of particle physics Quantum gravity and quantum information theory Cosmology and the evolution of the early universe Condensed matter About The School of Humanities and Sciences is the foundation of a liberal arts education at Stanford. The school encompasses 23 departments and 25 interdisciplinary programs. It is the university's home for fundamental research, where free, open, and critical inquiry is pursued across disciplines.
