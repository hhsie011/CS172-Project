PreviousNext Institutional Affiliation The program is affiliated with the Department of History of University College London, and students will have access to library and recreational facilities available to University College London students. Curriculum The History FSP consists of the following three courses (all three must be taken): History 95.01: London in History Through lectures, readings, discussions, and fieldwork this course explores aspects of London's history from medieval to modern times. Using the city itself as a living laboratory for historical thinking, the course relates the development of London and its neighborhoods to the larger concentric histories of nation, region, empire, and world. History 95.02: History Study Abroad Graded credit for this course is awarded to students who have successfully completed an approved course offered by the History faculty of University College London while a member of the Dartmouth Foreign Study Program in History. Selections for previous terms include: "The Human and Its Others: Enlightenment Ideas of Ethnicity and Race"; "Crime and Popular Disorder in England, 1714-1780"; "Penal Era or Golden Age? Ireland 1689-1801"; "Remembering Slavery"; and "Law's Empire: Legal Cultures in the British Colonial World." History 96.34: London-Based Archival Research and Historical Writing Independent Field Project The course instructor will work alongside the History London FSP director to aid students admitted to the program in developing and executing independent study proposals. This model, to be a permanent alteration, supplants earlier collective practice, in which a range of faculty supervised individual students on an ad hoc, unstructured basis. Living Arrangements Students live in flats in central London, within easy reach to UCL, theaters, museums and other famous historical sites. All flats have a comfortable living room, with television and wireless internet, and kitchens with a full range of crockery and utensils. Students will need to provide for their own meals. Criteria for Admission The size of the program is limited and admission is selective. You do not have to be a History major to apply, but before arrival in London participants should have taken two courses in History. Applicants to the program will be asked to outline briefly (250 word max.) the area, theme, or topic that they are interested in pursuing through their independent field project (History 96.34). Admitted students are required to take History 10.02 during the Summer preceding the program to prepare for their independent field project. Students who are not on during the preceding Summer Term may apply for an exception. Applications can be found on the Off-Campus Programs site.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of History Undergraduate Overview History FAQs for First Year and Transfer Students How to Declare a Major or Minor in History Major Modified Major Minor Transfer Credit Policy Course Descriptions First-Year Seminars Introductory Africa, Asia, Latin America & The Caribbean (AALAC) Europe (EUR) Interregional & Comparative (INTER) United States (US) Seminars & Colloquia Independent Study & Honors Course Schedule 2021-2022 Schedule 2022-2023 Schedule 2023-2024 Schedule Course Syllabi Honors Thesis Program General Timeline Guidelines for the Class of 2022 Guidelines for the Class of 2023 Honors Theses By Year Phi Alpha Theta Honors Society Prizes After Graduation Alumni Update Research Overview Faculty Research Initiatives Dartmouth History Institute Student Research Initiatives and Resources The Dartmouth Vietnam Project History Librarian Research Funding Resources Undergraduate Research Database Student Class Projects Foreign Study News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
