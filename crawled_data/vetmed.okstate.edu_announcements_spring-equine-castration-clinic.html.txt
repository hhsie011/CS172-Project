A limited number of tickets are available for each clinic. Castrations will be performed by third-year veterinary students under the supervision of board-certified faculty veterinarians from the veterinary hospital. Owners will be contacted prior to surgery to confirm participation. The registration fee is $40 for each horse. This is nonrefundable and does not include costs associated with any complications that may occur because of the inherent risk of the procedure. Costs for treatment due to complications are the owner’s responsibility. Eligible horses, donkeys or ponies for field castrations must be halter broke. Preferred age range is 1 month to 8 years old. Both testicles must be visibly descended (no cryptorchids). A current Coggins Test (within one year) must be provided. Animals must be trailered to and from the Large Animal Hospital on the day of the procedure. Participants will receive Tetanus prophylaxis (an antibiotic injection), anesthesia, and pain/anti-inflammatory medication. All animals need to be at the OSU Veterinary Medical Hospital Large Animal Entrance by noon and may be picked up no earlier than 5 p.m. Space is limited, and registration is required.
