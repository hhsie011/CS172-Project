If you are 20+ years of age and this is your first time attending college, you will be working with both Freshman Admissions and Transfer Services. While you are technically a "first-time freshman," UofL understands that you are in a different situation than students coming directly out of high school. As an adult first-time freshman, you are not required to: live on campus; attend an overnight freshman orientation. You will be required to: complete the new freshman application; meet the freshman admissions requirements for your intended program of study; attend a transfer/adult orientation; pay the freshman enrollment deposit. This process does require you to work between two offices, so we highly encourage you to reach out to our office first for admissions advising. From there, a dedicated transfer admissions counselor will work with you through the application process and act as a single point of contact within the Office of Admissions. Contact us! If you would like to speak our transfer admissions counselor who works specifically with our adult student population, please schedule an appointment with Brittney Hunt. Appointments are available in person and over the phone.
