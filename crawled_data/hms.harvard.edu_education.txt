Established in 1782, the School has produced generations of physicians whose life's work is to care for patients with skill, compassion and integrity. HMS graduates also embrace opportunities to have a broader impact on biomedicine. Some alumni, for example, bring new insights to disease through research while others champion solutions to seemingly intractable policy problems. The emphasis on leadership development extends to the School’s graduate programs, which foster profound discovery through classroom and laboratory instruction. Our educational programs advance Harvard Medical School's core mission to alleviate human suffering by nurturing a diverse group of leaders and future leaders in both clinical care and biomedical inquiry. These individuals are on the front lines of medicine and science serving individuals and populations locally, nationally, and globally.
