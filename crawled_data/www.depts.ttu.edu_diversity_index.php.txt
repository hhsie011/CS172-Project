Texas Tech University Directory Raiderlink A-Z Index Division of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Menu Search TTU Division of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Mission The Division of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DDEI) works across Texas Tech University to foster, affirm, celebrate, engage and strengthen inclusive communities through diversity, equity and inclusion. Using this framework as our foundation, we facilitate and support transformative opportunities that support the University Strategic Plan: to educate and empower a diverse student body, to enable innovative research and creative activities, while transforming lives and communities through strategic outreach and engaged scholarship. As we in DDEI work across the university, we are inspired by the opportunities to explore our differences as we celebrate our shared commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. The process of creating a culture that allows every individual to feel as though they matter, and they belong is not accidental, but intentionally created by those who are members of the community and how they welcome and retain new members. We establish our culture through shared practices and traditions, through our artwork and our food, through our words and our actions, through our practices/policies/procedures, through the photos we publish and the stories we tell, and through the ways in which we affirm and validate the experiences of others. Knowing this we are humbled by our role in reflecting to the world that Texas Tech University is a place we are proud to call our own and encourage others to do the same. Vision At Texas Tech we Foster, Affirm, Celebrate, Engage, Strengthen inclusive communities.
