If you have been accused of Academic/Research Misconduct but have not received a letter from the Office of Student Conduct, please review the information below regarding what your experience may entail: The following six-steps are a basic outline of what is recommended for faculty members who believe students have engaged in academic or research misconduct. Students who have questions regarding the student disciplinary process and the reporting procedures can refer to these procedures and the "What to Expect" portion of this website. It is recommended that faculty: Arrange for an opportunity to meet with the student and discuss their conclusions. Allow the student to provide their side of the story, and ask if they admit or deny responsibility for the misconduct. If they deny responsibility, do not yet assign a grade for the assignment or course (leave grade as N for grade processing). If they admit the misconduct, you may assign a grade according to your discretion and what you may have outlined in your syllabus. Refer the case and information to the Office of Student Conduct, including related materials such as emails, exams, essays, & websites. The Office of Student Conduct will review the information and send a letter to the student if it appears that policy may have been violated. When an outcome is determined by the Office of Student Conduct, both the faculty and student will be notified and apprised of the conclusions. For questions about an allegation of academic misconduct, please email the Director of the Office of Student Conduct at skellogg@iastate.edu.
