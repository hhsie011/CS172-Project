Architecture and Representation Amman Book Launch of The Arab City: Architecture and Representation On June 14, the Museum of Modern Art in New York hosted the book launch for The Arab City: Architecture and Representation, edited by Amale Andraos, Dean of the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation at Columbia University and Architecture Advisor to the President, Nora Akawi, Studio-X Amman Curator and Adjunct Assistant Professor at the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation, and Caitlin Blanchfield. June 14, 2016 On June 14, the Museum of Modern Art in New York hosted the book launch for The Arab City: Architecture and Representation, edited by Amale Andraos, Dean of the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation at Columbia University and Architecture Advisor to the President, Nora Akawi, Studio-X Amman Curator and Adjunct Assistant Professor at the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation, and Caitlin Blanchfield. Published by Columbia Books on Architecture and the City and distributed by Columbia University Press, the book is a result of the conference “The Arab City: Architecture and Representation” held on campus in November 2014, co-organized by Dean Amale Andraos and Nora Akawi, in partnership with the Columbia Global Centers | Amman, and the Middle East Institute. Moving beyond reductive notions of identity, myths of authenticity, the fetishizing of tradition, or the resilience of constructed oppositions between tradition and modernity, Architecture and Representation: The Arab City critically engages contemporary architectural and urban production in the Middle East. Taking the “Arab City” and “Islamic Architecture” as sites of investigation rather than given categories, the book reframes the region’s buildings, cities, and landscapes and broadens its architectural and urban canons. Arab cities are multifaceted places and sites of layered historical imaginaries; defined by regional and territorial economies, they bridge scales of production and political engagement. The essays collected in the book investigate cultural representation, the evolution of historical cities, contemporary architectural practices, emerging urban conditions, and responsive urban imaginaries in the Arab world. The Arab City includes contributions from Ashraf Abdalla, Senan Abdelqader, Nora Akawi, Suad Amiry, Amale Andraos, Mohammed al-Asad, Caitlin Blanchfield, Mohamed Elshahed, Yasser Elsheshtawy, Rania Ghosn, Saba Innab, Adrian Lahoud, Lila Abu Lughod, Ziad Jamaleddine, Bernard Khoury, Laura Kurgan, Ali Mangera, Reinhold Martin, Timothy Mitchell, Magda Mostafa, Nasser Rabbat, Hashim Sarkis, Felicity Scott, Hala Wardé, Eyal Weizman, and Gwendolyn Wright.
