Close Search / Engineering and Natural Sciences / MacKay innovation scholarship makes TU more affordable for STEM students MacKay innovation scholarship makes TU more affordable for STEM students January 15, 2018 The University of Tulsa has received a generous contribution from TU Trustee Andy MacKay and his wife, Helen, to create new academic opportunities for students pursuing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). The Andrew D. and Helen G. MacKay TU Scholarship for Innovation will provide annual awards for at least 20 incoming fall 2018 freshmen. Funding amounts will range from $10,000 to $25,000 a year for four years. This new scholarship is stackable with other scholarships and grants up to the cost of tuition plus room and board. The scholarships will be available for U.S. citizens with preference being given to Oklahoma residents and students from a military background. To be considered for a scholarship, students must have an ACT score ranging from 28 to 32, complete an application and FAFSA paperwork and major in one of the following programs within TU’s College of Engineering and Natural Sciences: mechanical engineering electrical/computer engineering computer science math/applied math engineering physics physics chemical engineering information technology computer simulation and gaming biology/biological science biochemistry chemistry The university continues to build on its foundational STEM programs as a center of innovation and technological entrepreneurship. TU is a national leader in areas such as cybersecurity, video game design and nanotechnology and supports local initiatives that encourage students, elementary through high school, to pursue degrees in STEM fields. “Helen and I are eager to grow the innovative environment at TU, throughout Tulsa and across the state,” MacKay said. “We hope to empower STEM students and encourage leadership in areas that will advance scientific and technological research.” Recipients of the new scholarship must complete their degrees in four years and maintain a minimum 3.0 grade-point average. The MacKays’ gift will add to the more than $21 million in financial aid that was awarded to TU freshmen in fall 2017, and 96 percent of those students received some form of financial assistance. “Our dedicated trustees, faculty and staff are committed to making TU an accessible option for students seeking a personalized experience at Oklahoma’s top-ranked university,” President Gerard Clancy said. “Thanks to the MacKays, TU is better equipped with funding to engage students in our nationally recognized engineering and science programs.” Andy MacKay is cofounder and president of Maccor, Inc., a Tulsa-based manufacturer of sophisticated battery test systems and a global leader in advanced electronics technologies and computer programming. He also is cofounder and chairman of Unicorp Systems, Inc., a Tulsa company specializing in aircraft equipment repair. Among many scholarships and academic initiatives, the MacKays support Golden Hurricane athletics, Tulsa’s Gilcrease Museum and STEM education programs.
