Our spirit of community is particularly striking. Though our students have varied backgrounds and represent more than 200 colleges and universities in the United States and abroad, they readily support one another in their learning. Diverse student groups also work together on common projects. Our community is characterized by care and concern for others. Our students work hard, of course, but they find other students, faculty, staff, and alumni mentors who help them through any rough patches. We realize that the theory and practice of law are complementary rather than conflicting. We have great respect for the craft of lawyering and teach it early and often, in our first-year research and writing program, Law Practice, in our nationally recognized clinical programs in the Center for Experiential Learning, and in many other aspects of the curriculum. We are also proud to be part of the long Jesuit tradition that combines the highest regard for learning with an emphasis on service to others. We stress professional responsibility throughout the curriculum. We believe the practice of law stands for something beyond detached analysis and neutral professional skills. Many of our classes and co-curricular activities connect directly to seeking justice, and we repeatedly consider the impact of our actions on the less fortunate. As a result, we emphasize the importance of pro bono service. This does not in any way diminish our commitment to a broad range of legal scholarship and learning. Our faculty continue to gain national and international recognition for their work in numerous areas of law, even as they remain focused on teaching and being accessible to students outside the classroom. Our students excel in their studies, their advocacy, and their involvement in countless community projects. At Boston College Law School, students are prepared to meet the many challenges of a successful legal career as they study in a supportive, collegial environment. You are always welcome to reach out to our students, faculty, and alumni to learn more about us. Contact our Admissions Office for more information.
