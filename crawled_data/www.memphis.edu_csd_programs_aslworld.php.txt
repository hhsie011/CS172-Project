American Sign Language courses AMSL 2010 and 2020 (or the equivalent) are acceptable courses to satisfy the world language requirement of some bachelor's degrees. These courses are offered through the School of Communication Sciences and Disorders. Unless a student has waived out of the introductory level (1000) courses, he or she will need to plan on four semesters of American Sign Language (ASL): AMSL 1010: Introduction to ASL 1 AMSL 1020: Introduction to ASL 2 AMSL 2010: Intermediate ASL 1 AMSL 2020: Intermediate ASL 2 Students must earn a grade of C or better in a class to advance to the next level. Completing the ASL language course sequence for the world language requirement does not prepare a student to work as an ASL completed interpreter. Students should not represent themselves to the public as interpreters. To learn more about becoming a certified ASL interpreter, please see the following sites: Become an interpreter Interpreting American Sign Language Students interested in testing out of a 1000-level course in ASL should email the ASL Program Coordinator in the School of Communication Sciences and Disorders.
