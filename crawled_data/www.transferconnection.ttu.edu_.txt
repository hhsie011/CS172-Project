"When I became involved in the Transfer Connection I quickly realized I WAS SO NOT ALONE. There were so many transfers out there feeling just as overwhelmed as I did. I suddenly felt like I found a place at Texas Tech.I made relationships that were beyond surface level because these people truly understood me. The Transfer Connection changed my college experience for the better, and I met all my closest friends through it." Violet Watson Supply Chain Management Transferred from University of Houston "The Transfer Connection meant that my university loved me and cared about my time as a Red Raider. It allowed me to meet new people when I didn't know anyone at first, and become a leader among my fellow students."
