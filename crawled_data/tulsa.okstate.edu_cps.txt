The College of Professional Studies offers flexible bachelor's degree programs to help working adults complete a bachelor’s degree that adds value to their current career. The Bachelor of Professional Studies is adaptable, with a flexible course schedule and real-world application to students’ current employment. Request Information A recent Market Street report showed the Tulsa metropolitan area 7.5 percentage points behind the rest of the nation in 25 to 44-year-olds with bachelor’s degrees. An estimated 90,000 Tulsans have some college credit, but no four-year degree – a major barrier to career advancement and attracting companies to the city. Many studies, including one by the Brookings Institute, tell us that the earnings profiles of bachelor’s degree graduates outperforms those of associate and high school degree graduates. Many working adults have some college credit, but life has paused their education. The College of Professional Studies seeks to remove barriers to obtaining bachelor’s degrees by providing flexible, focused degrees that maximize credit for prior learning, transfer credit and military credits. From an employer’s perspective, these degree programs are a new form of workforce development, providing a clear pathway to overcome the college degree barrier and enable employees to advance within their organization. Curricula are designed to meet the needs of students and the companies who employ them. Tulsa-area employers who have partnered with OSU-Tulsa on these degree programs include the Tulsa Police Department and TTCU Federal Credit Union.

OSU-Tulsa students graduate with the same OSU degree that students in Stillwater receive. Students generally transfer to OSU-Tulsa with an associate degree or at least 45 credit hours from another institution. The majority of our students take their first two years at Tulsa Community College or another local two- or four-year school, but students have transferred to OSU-Tulsa from colleges and universities across the country. OSU-Tulsa’s location adds to the value of that degree by giving our students access to the internship and volunteer opportunities, cultural attractions and social scene that come with an urban campus. Since many of OSU-Tulsa's students are working adults, we offer class schedules, course formats and amenities to support their success.
