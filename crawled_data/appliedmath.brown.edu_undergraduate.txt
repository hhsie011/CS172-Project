Applied Mathematics graduates join together outside of Saint Stephen's Church on the day of Commencement. Applied Mathematics has a profound impact on our daily lives. Whether it is weather forecasts, search engines, climate research, secure online shopping, or movie recommendations, none of these would work the way they do without algorithms and tools from the mathematical sciences. More generally, Applied Mathematics is an inherently interdisciplinary subject which applies to many problems that arise in the physical, life and social sciences as well as in engineering. Applied Mathematics provides a broad set of qualitative and quantitative skills and knowledge for use in these fields. Concentrations Our undergraduate program offers concentrations in: Applied Mathematics (A.B. and Sc.B.) Applied Mathematics-Biology (Sc.B.) Applied Mathematics-Computer Science (Sc.B.) Applied Mathematics-Economics (A.B. and Sc.B.) Concentration Requirements All concentrations have options for professional degrees. We offer a wide range of courses, and our faculty actively involves undergraduates in summer research projects and offers many independent studies every year. Information about these concentrations, including concentration requirements, concentration advisors, honors program, alumni career paths and recent job placements, can be found in the Undergraduate Program Finder or in our Undergraduate Handbook. Careers Our Applied Mathematics concentrations prepare students for a variety of careers. Our former students work in many different areas, including actuarial science and insurance companies banking, finance, and investment companies computer and software development consulting companies data analytics, and data science teaching graduate study in applied mathematics, mathematics, economics, and operations research law and medical school Applied mathematicians are often hired by companies who seek employees with strong analytical thinking and problem-solving skills: our courses and concentrations help you develop these skills. A list of positions that Brown Applied Math concentrators moved into after graduating can be found at the CareerLAB website. If you would like to find out more about the careers pursued by applied mathematicians, please have a look at the SIAM's career brochure, or go to the career pages of AMS, MAA and SIAM. More Information For more details about applied mathematics, possible career paths, and our concentrations, please check out our Undergraduate Handbook or contact one of our concentration advisors.
