Owing to its size, the collection is divided into a number of categories. Only approximately 5,000 titles have been cataloged and have records in the Library’s online catalog, Josiah. These include African-Americana, music relating to World Wars I and II, and musical settings of American poetry. The remainder are filed, usually by title (vocal) or composer (instrumental), as appropriate. The cataloged African American music, the World War I music, and the Yiddish American music have been digitized as part of the Library’s digital collections. The Sheet Music Collection is located in the John Hay Library.
