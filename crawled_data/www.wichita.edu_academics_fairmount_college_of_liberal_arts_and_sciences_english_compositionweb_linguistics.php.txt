The applied linguistics major at Wichita State University offers a rich and diverse experience for students interested in pursuing various aspects of language study and/or analysis. Students are introduced to the basic methodology and linguistic principles of linguistics, including phonological and grammatical concepts used in modern and historical linguistics. Students also study how language varies across time and space, and how it is used in different social contexts. They are also introduced to various subfields of linguistics, including phonetics and phonology, syntax and semantics, morphology, sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, historical linguistics, and applied linguistics. Linguistics classes are offered through departments of English, Anthropology, Modern Classical Languages and Literatures, Communication Sciences and Disorders, thereby engaging students in a truly interdisciplinary critical inquiry and enabling them to become informed participants in public discourse about language.

Back to top WichiLing: WSU Linguistics Club Welcome to Wichiling, the linguistics club at Wichita State University! We generally meet every other Friday afternoons at 12:00 pm in Lindquist Hall 503! The Linguistics Club at Wichita State University is open to everyone, whether or not you're a linguistics minor, and is free to join! Each week we meet to hang out, eat snacks, play language games, and talk linguistics. Sometimes an invited speaker comes in to talk about their job or research in linguistics, so WichiLing is a great way to network and think about your career as a linguist. It's also a good way to meet other linguistics students on campus if you want a study buddy! » Check out the WichiLing website » Follow WichiLing on Facebook Back to top 1845 Fairmount St.Wichita, Kansas 67260 USA (316) 978-3456 Request InfoVisitApply Contact Us Virtual Tour Campus Map and Directions Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube TikTok Wichita State has helped me put marketing strategy in a real-world perspective.
