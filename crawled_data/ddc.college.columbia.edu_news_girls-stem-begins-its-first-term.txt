Newsletters Search Enter a keyword Search Girls STEM Begins its First Term DDC has expanded its informal science education options to include a Girls STEM initiative for the Spring 2017 term. The goal of the program is to increase girls participation in science learning opportunities, encourage girls to pursue science careers, and have fun. For ten weeks high school freshmen and sophomores meet in laboratories on the Morningside Campus with Columbia graduate students and post doctoral researchers to take Saturday courses in Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. The new program is generously sponsored by the Patrina Foundation. Pictured below is the “Life in the Lab” course, taught by Chiara Bertipaglia, a Post-Doctoral Researcher at the Vallee Lab. The students are engaged in molecular cloning.
