(There is no GRK 2). These courses cover all the basics and introduce some reading skills. During Spring term, there is also the option of Intensive Greek, a two-credit course that covers both GRK 1 and GRK 3. Successful completion of GRK 3 satisfies the College language requirement. If you have already studied ancient Greek before coming to Dartmouth, please read the section on Placement in Ancient Greek. Continuing your study of Greek After completing Greek 1 and 3, you will enter an intermediate course, Greek 10, which will be based around a theme or an important text. For instance, we might read Plato's Crito or one of the beautiful speeches by Lysias. As you proceed, you will continue to develop your overall knowledge of the language, and will be able to immerse yourself in some of the ideas circulating in Athens in its political, literary, and philosophical heyday. If you are unable to take Greek 10 in the spring term, there is another opportunity in the fall. After Greek 10 you are eligible for any course numbered 20 or above. Homer's Iliad, Euripides' Medea, Plato's Republic, the New Testament Greek are just a few of the texts you might read in the original language. During sophomore summer, there is a combined seminar with the advance Latin students.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Classics Curriculum Overview Course Offerings by Term Fall 2021 Winter 2022 Spring 2022 Summer 2022 Fall 2022 Winter 2023 Spring 2023 2023-24 Classical Studies Courses Entry points for Classical Studies Literature, Philosophy, Religion Ancient History Classical Archaeology Language Study -- Latin Latin Classes Placement in Latin Language Study -- Ancient Greek Courses in Ancient Greek Placement in Ancient Greek Majors and Minors Classical Studies track Ancient History track Classical Archaeology track Classical Languages and Literature track Culminating Experience Foreign Study NEW Classics FSP in Spring 2022 Greece Foreign Study Program Rome Foreign Study Program Projects & Awards Classics-Related Projects and Awards Student Research Archaeological Fieldwork Reid/Wiencke Funding for Research Senior Honors Projects Awards & Prizes Faculty Media Projects Annual Lecture Programs Faculty Books Inclusivity News & Events People Our graduates Graduating with a Classics Degree Alumni Support Tell Us Your Story Alumni Stories My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
