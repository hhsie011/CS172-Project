About Undergraduate Graduate Local and Community History Certificate Programs Religion Courses Faculty Awards Alumni Clio's Correspondence Newsletter "Pursuing graduate work in history allowed me to develop skills that serve me well in my industry. The critical thinking required in the study of history lends itself well to finance. Numbers and objectivity go well together. I use research techniques every day. There is a great deal of research – especially of technical documents like system manuals – in my current role. My background helps me find key information quickly when presented with significant amounts of data. Effective communication – like the ability to take complex concepts and simplify them for a broader audience – is expected."
