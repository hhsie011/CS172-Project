Undergraduate Programs Master’s Programs Certificates of Advanced Study Doctoral Programs Online Programs Courses & Advising Graduation and Retention Data Data for those matriculating (entering the MSLIS degree) from 2012 to 2019. Data for seven years since matriculation is provided. While the number of credits a matriculated student may take will vary throughout the student’s program, the data below are based on the number of credits a student takes during the person’s first semester (0-8 credits for part-time; 9 or more for full-time). For full-time students, the MSLIS curriculum is optimized for completion in two years; Syracuse University requires that students in a master’s program graduate within seven years after beginning the program. These data were last updated February 2022. Full-time, On-Campus Data based on matriculation from 2012-2013 to 2018-2019; 14-31 students starting full-time in each of these years.

Successful Transfer of Credit into the MSLIS program Graduate students in the iSchool may seek to transfer into their program of study up to six credits from another graduate institution. For those credits to be considered, it is required that they relate to the student’s program of study and be within 7 years of the student’s anticipated graduation from the MSLIS program. It is our experience that few students transfer in credits, because of those requirements. However, we encourage any prospective student, who is interested in this option, to talk with an admissions counselor about the process. MSLIS with School Media Specialization (MSLIS: SM) New York State Licensure Pass Rates Teachers certified in New York State, who are seeking an MSLIS with School Media Specialization, do not have to take the Education All Students or the edTPA. Students who do not pass the test on their first try are able to retake the test until they receive a passing score or, if available, use the Safety Net provided by the New York State Education Department. Students who do not pass the edTPA are able to use the Safety Net as implemented by the New York State Education Department, passing an alternate state exam: Assessment of Teaching Skills (ATSW).
