To learn and get experience with writing a finding aid, I’m working with materials that already have a finding aid, “The Chinese Church of Christ in Korea papers 1908-1975.” Some of what needed to be done was basic copy editing and formatting the […] Read More… Posted in Student EntryTagged Chinese Church of Christ in Korea, Collections, interns, Korea, library science, Missionaries, MRL, MRL8, Processing, studentsLeave a comment The Relevance of Reference: A Discovery Posted on November 22, 2013 by Rossy Mendez People always ask me why I want to become an archivist, and I always respond with some idealized blanket answer that references the preservation of history and provision of access to everyone. My answers are always filled with such good will that I feel as if some heroic composition should be playing as I recite […] Read More… Posted in Student EntryTagged History, Missionaries, reference1 Comment “These Are Bloody Times in Which We Live…”: The Journal of Mary Lewis Shedd Posted on September 11, 2012 (September 11, 2012) by Brigette C. Kamsler June 17, 1918 One of the first collections I processed at Burke was MRL2: Mary Lewis [Mrs. W. A.] Shedd Papers, 1918.

It's a pretty unpopular concept these days. Missionaries are associated with all the damage wrought by the project of subjugation, exploitation, displacement, and genocide of native peoples and cultures across the world. The criticisms are well-founded. Retrospect is a tricky thing though. History is often tainted by a touch of arrogance and a […] Read More… Posted in Student EntryTagged Archives, History, Imperialism, Missionaries, Missions, MRL12, students1 Comment Search Quick Links Staff Contributors Student Bloggers Recent Posts The Construction and Evolution of the UTS Campus: a Re-Imagined Exhibit Union Seminary Quarterly Review (USQR) Archive Gratian’s “Decretum” and the Foundations of Christian Legal Education Looking Back & Looking Forward Belonging As a Latinx Seminarian Archives April 2022 March 2022 February 2022 December 2021 November 2021 September 2021 May 2021 April 2021 March 2021 February 2021 January 2021 May 2020 April 2020 March 2020 February 2020 January 2020 November 2019 October 2019 September 2019 August 2019 July 2019 June 2019 May 2019 April 2019 March 2019 February 2019 December 2018 November 2018 October 2018 September 2018 May 2018 April 2018 March 2018 February 2018 January 2018 December 2017 September 2017 August 2017 July 2017 June 2017 May 2017 April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 Tags Archives Behind the Stacks Burke Archives Burke Library COVID-19 CUL Graduate Student Internship CUL Graduate Student Internship Program Diary ecumenism Exhibits FMCNA German Graduate Intern History Imperialism India Instruction interns Journal library science Luce Luce Foundation Manuscripts Missionaries Missions More Product Less Process MRL MRL3 MRL10 MRL12 Native Americans NCC prisoners of war Processing Rare Books Special Collections students Union Theological Seminary Union Theological Serminary UNP WAB war Water Disaster WCC work-study Subscribe2 Leave This Blank:Leave This Blank Too:Do Not Change This: Your email: Category Specific RSS Archives (41) Burke Library History (10) Burke Staff (8) Circulation & Delivery (4) Collections (2) Events (1) History (38) Manuscripts (4) Rare books (30) Student Entry (86) Student projects (1) Uncategorized (2) Union Theological Seminary History (25) CUL Blogs Home CUL Blogs Dashboard 535 West 114th St. New York, NY 10027 | Telephone (212) 854-7309 | Fax (212) 854-9099 Copyright | Policies | Suggestions & Feedback | Contact Us | About Us
