To apply to the History Honors Thesis Program, you must propose a thesis topic and secure the agreement of a faculty member to advise the project. If you are interested in participating in the History Honors Thesis Program, you should consider topics of interest to you and discuss them with potential faculty advisers as early as possible. All ideas require discussion, development, and preliminary research to transform them into viable research topics. We strongly advise you to communicate with and secure a faculty adviser by the end of spring term of your junior year. For the Class of 2023, you should apply for admission to the Honors Program using this form: HISTORY HONORS PROGRAM APPLICATION FORM The form asks for details of History courses you have taken, your GPA (overall and in History specifically), and your identification of a potential thesis adviser from among the History faculty. It also asks that you provide a brief description of your area of research interest, including any ideas about potential primary sources (350 words maximum). You will develop a more detailed research proposal at the start of the fall term in HIST 98. Your application will be evaluated primarily on your meeting the GPA standards (3.0 GPA overall and 3.5 in History – with at least 5 History classes completed before Fall 22) and in the approval of your potential faculty adviser. If you are interested in writing a thesis but do not meet the criteria for admission based upon GPA or History courses taken, then you may consider submitting a petition for special admission, explaining your interest in the program and your experience in History courses at Dartmouth, alongside the application form. If you plan to submit a petition you must contact the Honors Program Director, Professor Paul Musselwhite (paul.musselwhite@dartmouth.edu) in advance to discuss this option. Applications will be considered on a rolling basis beginning March 28th 2022 (first day of Spring classes) and up until the Friday, Sept 9th 2022 (the Friday before Fall classes begin). If you know that you will be seeking research funding for the Fall term or Winterim (for travel to archives or to acquire copies of archival records etc.) then you should seek confirmation of your admission as soon as possible in order to qualify for Summer and Fall Term research funds. The department can provide some limited research funding to students conducting honors research and details on this will be made available to Honors students in the fall. However, more extensive funding is available through the following channels: UGAR thesis funding for Summer and Fall Term (up to $2,500) – Deadlines Apr. 27th (for Summer Term research funding) and July 27th (for Fall Term research funding) Rockefeller Center Thesis Funding for Fall Term (up to $1,000) – Deadline May 1st Leslie Center Student Research Grant for Summer and Fall Terms (up to $1,500) – Deadline June 1st UGAR, Rockefeller and Leslie also offer funding for research during Winterim and Winter and Spring Term. The deadlines for this additional funding are during the fall term and can be found on the relevant websites. Be sure to consult your adviser about your funding applications; in addition to providing a letter of support, they can help you develop a budget and craft your application. If you have any other questions about the application process or the Honors Program in general, please do not hesitate to contact the Honors Program Director, Professor Paul Musselwhite (Paul.P.Musselwhite@Dartmouth.edu).

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of History Undergraduate Overview History FAQs for First Year and Transfer Students How to Declare a Major or Minor in History Major Modified Major Minor Transfer Credit Policy Course Descriptions First-Year Seminars Introductory Africa, Asia, Latin America & The Caribbean (AALAC) Europe (EUR) Interregional & Comparative (INTER) United States (US) Seminars & Colloquia Independent Study & Honors Course Schedule 2021-2022 Schedule 2022-2023 Schedule 2023-2024 Schedule Course Syllabi Honors Thesis Program General Timeline Guidelines for the Class of 2022 Guidelines for the Class of 2023 Honors Theses By Year Phi Alpha Theta Honors Society Prizes After Graduation Alumni Update Research Overview Faculty Research Initiatives Dartmouth History Institute Student Research Initiatives and Resources The Dartmouth Vietnam Project History Librarian Research Funding Resources Undergraduate Research Database Student Class Projects Foreign Study News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
