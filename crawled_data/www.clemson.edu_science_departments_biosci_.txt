We then apply this knowledge to areas such as medicine, conservation, and agriculture. Our motto, From Molecules to Ecosystems, captures the excitement of discovery and dedication to the scientific process found in our large department. The applications of biology affect the health and well-being of individuals in their societies and the continuation of earth as a balanced ecosystem. We aim to produce informed citizens who not only contribute to the scientific community, but also to the ongoing dialogue concerning the many ethical, social, and political issues that have biological context or consequences.
