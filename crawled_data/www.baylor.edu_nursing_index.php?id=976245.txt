Please use the transfer course equivalency tool to verify. Please note: The following applies to any college work taken prior to transfer: To determine whether a course will transfer into Baylor University from another college or university, please refer to the Equivalent Course Tool. The most recent grade earned in a course will be used to calculate prerequisite GPA. However, any grade earned below a "C" will be factored into GPA but will require an applicant to retake the course in order to achieve a passing grade. If a science or foreign language course is offered with separate lecture and lab, both portions must be completed. It is recommended that separate lecture and lab portions be completed through the same university or college. Credit by examination secured through another college or university by a student transferring to Baylor University will be accepted only to the extent that the exam and scores are equivalent to what Baylor accepts. Scores received must meet the Baylor University minimum score requirements stated in the Credit By Examination brochure in effect in the year that the student entered college as a freshmen. To find more information regarding accepted exams and minimum score requirements, please refer to the Baylor University testing website click here. HESI A2 Entrance Exam Students must complete the following sections: English Composite (reading comprehension, vocabulary, general knowledge & grammar) Math Minimum scores of 80 or better on both the HESI A2 math and English composite portions are required to be eligible to apply to the nursing program. The HESI A2 exam may only be taken once during each admission period. In the event a student has taken the exam more than once, the most recent exam will be counted.
