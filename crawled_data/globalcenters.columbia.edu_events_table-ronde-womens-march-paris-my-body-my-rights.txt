However, in the debate over bodily autonomy in France, certain voices are almost completely ignored: those of people of color, Muslims, LGBTQI+ people, people with disabilities, fat people, and sex workers… They are denied this fundamental human right in extremely violent and often fatal ways. For the third anniversary of Women’s March Paris, we want to create space to encourage the exchange of ideas around the notion of bodily autonomy by those most concerned. The goal is to change perspectives and advance human rights. Among those joining the discussion are Amy Hong, a consultant on migration policies for international organizations and producer of the documentary Regarder le racisme en face (in production); Rose, a black queer non-binary student and activist; Nta Rajel ?, a collective of North African decolonial feminists; and ASSOCIATION DIIVINESLGBTQI+ VISIBILITÉ REPRÉSENTATIVITÉ AFRO-CARÏBÉEN.NES LGBTQI+ PARIS CARAÏBE-AFRIQUE, who promotes the visibility and representation of LGBTQI+ people of color who are Afro-Caribbean and Afro-descendants. The event will take place in French and English. Entrance is free, but please bring a menstrual product to donate to the fight against menstrual precarity. If you are a US citizen, you will also be able to register to vote and take a stand for bodily autonomy in the US. --- L’autonomie corporelle, le droit de disposer de son propre corps librement, sans contraintes ou pressions extérieures, est un droit humain essentiel. Mais dans le débat autour de l’autonomie corporelle en France, la société ne prend que rarement en compte les expériences des personnes racisées, musulmanes, LGBTQI+, handicapées, grosses et/ou travailleuses de sexe…et le déni de leurs droits humains est extrêmement violent et peut même attenter à leur vie. Pour le troisième anniversaire de Women’s March Paris, nous organisons une table ronde avec un objectif d'encourager l’échange d’idées sur la notion d’autonomie corporelle afin de changer le regard de la société et faire avancer les droits, depuis le point de vue des concerné.e.s. Cette conversation aura lieu en français et en anglais en présence de Amy Hong, une consultante en politiques migratoires pour des organisations internationales et productrice du documentaire Regarder le racisme en face (à venir) ; Rose, un.e étudiant.e et militant.e queer noir.e et non-binaire ; Nta Rajel ?, collectif féministe de la diaspora nord-africaine de politique décoloniale ; et ASSOCIATION DIIVINESLGBTQI+ VISIBILITÉ REPRÉSENTATIVITÉ AFRO-CARÏBÉEN.NES LGBTQI+ PARIS CARAÏBE-AFRIQUE, qui promeut la visibilité et représentativité des personnes Afro-Carïbéennes, Afrodescendantes, et racisées LGBTQI+. L’événement est gratuit, mais nous vous demandons d'apporter comme don un produit menstruel pour lutter contre la précarité menstruelle.
