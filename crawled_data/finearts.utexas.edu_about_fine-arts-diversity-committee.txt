Formed as a taskforce in 2012, the council is made up of representatives from faculty, staff, graduate students and undergraduate students from the College of Fine Arts, the Department of Art and Art History, the Department of Theatre and Dance, Butler School of Music and Texas Performing Arts, as well as staff from the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement and the Office for Inclusion and Equity. After a two-year planning and research process, the council shared its strategic plan in 2014, and the college is actively working to implement the goals of the five-year plan, which covers 2014–2019. The strategic plan outlines goals in three focused areas: Culture & Climate, Recruitment & Retention, and Curriculum & Creative Programming.
