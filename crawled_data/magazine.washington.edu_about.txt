Twice in the years since then, the magazine ceased publication entirely—during World War I and in the mid-1930s—only to be revived each time. For most of these years it was published by the UW Alumni Association and sent only to UWAA members. In 1989, the magazine was redesigned, its circulation expanded and the name changed to Columns. In 2019, the publication rebranded and expanded into University of Washington Magazine. The print magazine is published four times a year in September, December, March and June. To help us ensure that we continue to be responsible stewards of natural and financial resources, the print edition is now mailed to contactable alumni and donors each September, unless they have opted out of receiving print communications. UWAA members and UW donors will continue to receive print issues in December, March and June unless they have opted out of print mailings.
