At NC State, we join in this important celebration now and throughout the year. There are many opportunities to learn more about and honor the rich heritage and tremendous contributions of Black, African and African American people, to our university, our state and our nation. I encourage us all to take time to learn more about and acknowledge the challenges and celebrate the contributions, aspirations and accomplishments of the Black community — both here at NC State and beyond. NC State’s African American Cultural Center is celebrating 30 years in the Witherspoon Student Center this year. The center is focusing events throughout the year on the theme of connection and community building. After so much time apart and in virtual spaces throughout the pandemic, this theme and the accompanying events offer our community opportunities to reconnect, learn and grow together. A few highlights during Black History Month include: The Blacks in Wax live museum event, sponsored by the African American Cultural Center on Feb. 11, which brings the past to life for key moments in Black history. The Women’s Center and the African American Cultural Center are co-hosting the HERMonies: Black Sounds, Black Voices, Black Movements exhibit on Feb. 15, which highlights the important role Black women artists have played in advancing social justice. The African American Cultural Center, the Eta Omicron Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc. and the NC State chapter of the National Pan-Hellenic Council are sponsoring the March Like Martin event on Feb. 25. The event will celebrate the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as organizers march from Talley Student Union to Harris Field in front of the Witherspoon Student Center. These are just a few of the ways you can get engaged in exploring and celebrating Black history. For more events and opportunities, please see this calendar listing, subscribe to the Diversity Digest, and take time to explore all that our four community centers provide to the NC State community. Without doubt, there remains much to do in the world and here at NC State to achieve true equality for all. To move forward together, I believe it’s helpful to understand where we’ve been. Our university library has put together a timeline of African American history on campus. I encourage you to take some time to read through it and honor those who laid the foundation we build on today. Take a moment to also read the university’s vision and values, our core beliefs, which reflect NC State’s commitment to creating and sustaining a diverse, equitable and inclusive community in all that we do. I hope all in our Wolfpack will join in this month — and every month — to celebrate and honor Black history and progress at NC State and across our nation.
