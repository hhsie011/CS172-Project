Please scroll down for Turkish. Held in conjunction with the exhibition “Blue Voyagers,” this panel explores connections between the two featured modern artists, Romare Bearden (American) and Bedri Rahmi Eyuboglu (Turkish) and the issues of translation their work raises. Bearden’s “translations” of Homer’s Odyssey—centerpieces of the exhibition--foreground the translation from Ancient Greece to Modern America and from literature to painting. Both these painters “translate” tones and rhythms in music—in Bearden’s case specifically in jazz--onto canvas and paper. What do these artistic voyagers add to forms they bring in from cultures not natively their own? How do translation, adaption, and improvisation invite us to invite the other in? Date and time: April 16, 18:00 - 20:30 Venue: Sismanoglio Megaro. Istiklal Cad. No: 60 Beyoğlu - Istanbul Note that Turkish - English simultaneous translation will be provided during the panel Please RSVP to attend the panel by clicking here. Moderator: Robert G.

Bearden’nın, serginin de belkemiğini oluşturan Homeros’un Odyssesia destanı “çevirileri” antik Yunan’dan modern Amerikan’a, resimden edebiyata çeviri konusunu öne çıkarıyor. Bu iki ressam da müzikteki - Bearden'ın örneğinde cazda - ses ve ritimleri tuval ve kağıda aktarıp çeviriyorlar. Bu sanatçı seyyahlar kendilerinin olmayan kültürlerden nasıl besleniyorlar, bu doğrultuda kendi sanatsal formlarına nasıl katkıda bulunuyorlar? Sanat; çeviri, uyarlama ve doğaçlama üzerinden kendimize ve “öteki”ne bakışımızı nasıl şekillendirebilir? Tarih ve saat: 16 Nisan, 18:00 - 20:30 Yer: Sismanoglio Megaro Binası. Istiklal Cad.
