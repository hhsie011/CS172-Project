Baylor implemented web filtering in 1999 at the behest of University Regents and the President. Baylor ITS understands that filtering web content presents many challenges. Web filtering companies operate based on verified lists of categorized URLs. As noted, Baylor only blocks sites that fall into the adult content category. Since categorizing websites is not an exact science, mistakes are sometimes made causing a perfectly legitimate site to be blocked. If you receive the warning message depicted below when trying to access a non-pornographic site, contact HelpDesk+.
