One to help yourself, the second to help others.” –Audrey Hepburn Over the 25 years I have been at Cal State Fullerton, many have lent their hand to help us and our family… now it is our turn to help others by making a difference by donating to OUR University. Anh Nelson | Executive Assistant to the Vice President for Student Affairs Rick Nelson | Events & Facilities Use Program Administrator There’s no better investment than educating those who will succeed us, and supporting Cal State Fullerton today will pay dividends for many decades to come. As a retired New York Times editor who started as a Cal State Fullerton graduate and is now a faculty member, I’ve seen many Titans rise to the highest tiers of their professions. The opportunity to give back is my way of saying thanks to those who generously gave before me. Walt Baranger | Daily Titan Adviser I love working at Cal State Fullerton. It is truly a special place. I can’t think of a better investment than our students. Go Titans! Kelly Ford | Softball Coach As proud Cal State Fullerton graduates, we truly value the amazing education we have received and are so fortunate to be able to apply our knowledge every day as professionals here on campus. We invest in Cal State Fullerton and feel privileged to be able to see the future in the faces of the students. It doesn’t get any better than that. Titan Pride! Carlos Leija | Associate Vice President, University Advancement Gwen Leija | Business Manager, Athletics I give to CSUF to support the mission of the university and to express my gratitude for everything the institution has done for me. Quite frankly, as is the case for many of our students, I can't imagine my life without CSU Fullerton. With state support shrinking every dollar I give really matters, and I'm glad to do what I can. Emily Miller Bonney | Dean, Pollak Library and Professor of Liberal Studies “I give to Cal State Fullerton because it make me feel good knowing that my contribution is helping change a young person’s life. In some small way I know my gift has had a direct impact on a life by helping someone get a head without student load debit or by helping someone have a unique educational experiences they never would otherwise be able to experience. Cal State Fullerton and I share the same commitment to student success, which gives me great joy knowing my gift is making a difference!” Dale A. Merrill | Dean, College of the Arts I love the work we do at Cal State Fullerton to make higher education accessible, especially for first generation and underrepresented students. We strive not only to provide excellence in the classroom but to support students outside of the classroom. I give to programs in the Division of Politics, Administration and Justice to provide students with resources to succeed. When we are able to host events for our students so they can learn from alumni and professionals in our community, I know we’re helping our students realize their potential and discover long-term success.
