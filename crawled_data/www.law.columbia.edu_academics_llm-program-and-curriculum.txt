The possibilities for learning, networking, and growing professionally at Columbia Law School are endless. U.S. Bar Exams Lawyers with a foreign law degree who wish to take a bar examination after graduation should familiarize themselves with the eligibility and general requirements of the bar exam they wish to take. Completion of the LL.M. degree in itself does not guarantee eligibility to take a bar examination. Most states will require a J.D. degree from a U.S. law school in order to sit for the bar exam. In cases where a state does allow foreign law graduates to sit for the bar exam, including in New York, as a general rule, at least three years of legal study, not including the LL.M. degree, are required for eligibility. The Law School’s Office of Registration Services is responsible for the bar certification of any LL.M. student intending to sit for a U.S. bar examination. Click to Open New York Bar Exam For information on the New York State bar examination, contact the New York State Board of Law Examiners directly. The rules which govern the eligibility of foreign-trained lawyers who can qualify for the bar examination by earning a U.S. LL.M. are governed by Section 520.6 of the Rules of the Court of Appeals for the Admission of Attorneys and Counselors at Law (22 NYCRR 520.6). It is your responsibility to have your eligibility to sit for the bar determined by the Board of Law Examiners. You begin that process by completing the process described on their website. The first step is completing this evaluation and sending all supporting documentation. Only the Board can make the determination, and it takes generally around six months, so it is best to send your requests early. It is also your responsibility to make sure you meet all deadlines for applying to take the bar exam and to submit all of the required materials to the Board. Columbia Law School and the Office of Graduate Degree Programs are not responsible for monitoring bar exam deadlines or for updating you if the deadlines or rules for applying change. The Office of Graduate Degree Programs cannot make copies of your foreign law school transcripts, nor can we give you the copies we have on file. No exceptions will be made. It is your responsibility to obtain additional copies of your transcripts if you plan to take the bar exam. We recommend that you do this as soon as possible during the fall semester, if you did not request them prior to arriving at Columbia (as we recommended in our pre-arrival materials).
