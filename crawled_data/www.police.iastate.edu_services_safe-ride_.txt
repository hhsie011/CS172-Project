If walking to your car or residence hall leaves you feeling a little uneasy and apprehensive, call SafeRide. We will be glad to escort you to your destination. SafeRide is available throughout central campus and other university areas, including ISU-leased residence apartments, Greek parking lots and the basketball practice facility. Anyone on campus, including visitors, can request a ride. To obtain a SafeRide, call 515-294-4444 and DPS personnel will assist you in getting to your campus destination. If you are an Iowa State student, faculty or staff member, you can request SafeRide by downloading the free SafeRideISU app available for iOS and Android. Those requesting a ride through the app will receive on-screen notification of the pickup time, vehicle license plate number and a real-time map view that tracks vehicle progress to the pickup site. Answering the SafeRide summons will be ISU students who work for the police as community service officers. These uniformed students will pick up riders in university vehicles. Visitors and others who don’t have the SafeRide ISU app can request a ride by calling a SafeRide dispatcher at 515-294-4444. SafeRide reserves the right to refuse this service to persons who behave improperly, are abusive to SafeRide personnel, or abuse the service.
