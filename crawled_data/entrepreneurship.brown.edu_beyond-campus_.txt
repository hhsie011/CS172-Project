The Nelson Center for Entrepreneurship — in conjunction with BrownConnect and other partners — offers a variety of programs and initiatives, such as our Startup Synapse programs, that support students exploring these critical linkages from Barcelona to Silicon Valley. “From the people to the city, I could not have envisioned or planned a better experience. Barcelona Synapse was truly an opportunity of a lifetime. Aside from the exposure to the start-up culture, Synapse proved to be a catalyst for self-reflection and intergroup dialogue.” – Julia Sepúlveda-Ávalos ‘20, International Relations TOKYO The Nelson Center for Entrepreneurship partnered with our student club, Brown EP, for Tuesdays in Tokyo, 2022 a speaker series focused on the macro view of entrepreneurship in Japan with a focus on Tokyo. As part of our ongoing Synapse program, students met with founders, policymakers, and others via video conference. Students examined entrepreneurship in Japan through the lens of Japan’s social, cultural, policy, and financial structures. Students presented their findings to the greater Brown community over sushi at the end of the semester. It is our hope that the student cohort and our connections through Tuesdays in Tokyo will one day result in in-person visits and lasting relationships between the speakers in this series and Brown University.
