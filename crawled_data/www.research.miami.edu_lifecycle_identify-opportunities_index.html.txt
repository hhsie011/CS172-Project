The University provides access to global databases for research administration and funding opportunities. The Office of the Vice Provost for Research & Scholarship also collects proposals for limited submissions (opportunities for which only one team per institution can apply). Pivot Pivot is the most comprehensive and trusted source for global funding information. It saves searches and tracks opportunities, and allows you to discover collaborators and get tailored funding recommendations and alerts. Limited Submission Competitions Limited Submission Applications are funding opportunities for which an external agency limits the number of proposals an institution may submit. Corporate and Foundations Development and Alumni Relations helps connect researchers and scholars with philanthropists, corporations and foundations that share their interests and goals.
