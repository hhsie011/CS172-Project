Upstream Midstream & Downstream Alternatives & Enablers Policy & Management Upstream The upstream energy sector involves exploration and production of oil and gas, including underwater or underground crude oil, natural gas fields and drilling wells. Professionals in this sector include geologists and geophysicists, who determine where resources can be found; petroleum engineers, who work with geoscientists to understand geologic formations, and mechanical engineers, who optimize physics and materials science to design, examine and manufacture mechanical systems. Educational Program Undergraduate Graduate Doctoral Certificate Chemical Engineering ✔ ✔ ✔ Geographic Information Systems ✔ Geology ✔ ✔ ✔ Geophysics ✔ ✔ ✔ Geosensing Systems Engineering ✔ ✔ Hydrogeology ✔ Mechanical Engineering ✔ ✔ ✔ Petroleum Engineering ✔ ✔ ✔ Petroleum Geology ✔ Petroleum Geophysics ✔ Petroleum Technology ✔ Subsea Engineering ✔ ✔ Supply Chain Management ✔ ✔ Midstream & Downstream The midstream and downstream energy sectors comprise bringing oil and gas to distributors, conversion and storage of natural resources, refinement of fossil fuels, as well as marketing and distribution of fossil fuels. Professionals in this sector include construction managers, who maintain and operate pipelines and other modes of transporting energy resources; experts in geopolitics, for those interested in policy and law, and various technology regulations, and industrial and materials engineers, who refine fossil fuels for distribution.
