Not only do you get to come to work on a beautiful college campus each day, but there's also so much going on and plenty to do outside of work too. All benefits-eligible employees get discounts on season tickets to see the Red Raiders in action in football, baseball and men's and women's basketball. Employees also get discounts on green fees and memberships at The Rawls Golf Course, a premier golf course just north of campus. If the arts are more your style, employees also receive a discount to enjoy main stage performances by the Department of Theatre and Dance. Plus, the School of Art and School of Music have a full slate of shows, concerts and more. Finally, the Museum of Texas Tech is home to many world-class exhibitions as well as the Moody Planetarium, which features laser and astronomy shows. As you can see, there's always something going on at Texas Tech. For the full calendar, visit Events@TexasTech.
