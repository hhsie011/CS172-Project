We encourage graduate students to take advantage of Stanford's open course enrollment culture. Taking classes outside of your department can lead to broader knowledge, new skills, and a wider campus network. Many courses are designed to attract students from across campus and most faculty welcome the diverse perspectives that non-majoring students contribute. VPGE has identified courses that, based on their description in Explore Courses, appear to align with VPGE's Grad Grow Professional Development, Career Planning, or Interdisciplinary Learning portfolios. Grad Grow Professional Development Course Feeds These courses offer opportunities to build the skills and gain the experiences outlined in Grad Grow Professional Development. The teaching courses are also displayed in the Preparing for Faculty Careers section of the website. Communication courses Teaching & Mentoring courses Leadership & Management courses Diversity, Equity & Inclusion courses Professionalism courses Career Development courses Interdisciplinary Learning Course Feed These courses offer opportunities to work with students from across campus and to build your own interdisciplinary learning skills.
