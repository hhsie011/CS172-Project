Other tests ordered by your provider, including most blood work, are sent to an outside laboratory. The results return to your Medical Services provider, who will contact you through a secure web message. Eligibility All students who have paid the Columbia Health and Related Services Fee are eligible to use the Medical Services lab. There is no cost to students who have enrolled in the Columbia Student Health Insurance Plan. Students with outside insurance, for example those who remain on their parents’ insurance, will receive a bill sent to the primary insurance holder and can submit that bill to the insurance provider. Getting Started Medical Services providers who request lab tests will have the student proceed to the lab on the third floor of John Jay Hall. Check the lab hours, which vary during the academic term and summer recess. If lab tests are requested by an outside provider, we encourage students to have the specialist draw the labs or schedule a visit with an in-network facility that is covered by their insurance. Laboratory Hours During the Academic Year Monday–Thursday, 10:00 a.m.–5:00 p.m. Friday, 9:00 a.m.–4:00 p.m. During Summer Recess Monday–Thursday, 9:00 a.m.–4:00 p.m. Friday, 9:00 a.m.–3:00 p.m. Frequently Asked Questions Expand all Collapse all Does Medical Services offer x-rays and lab work? We perform some laboratory work at Medical Services in John Jay Hall, but if you need an X-ray or other imaging studies, your Medical Services provider will refer you to Westside Radiology or Columbia Doctors (various locations). Once results are available, we will follow up with you. How does the laboratory work with my outside physician? When outside specialists request additional lab tests, we encourage students to have the specialist draw the labs or schedule a visit with an in-network facility that is covered by their insurance.
