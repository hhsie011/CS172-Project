We provided advocacy, outreach, education, support, and community to LGBTQ+ students of all identities, backgrounds, and experiences. We envision a community where individuals experience a sense of community, empowerment, and inclusion and can thrive as their whole authentic selves. The resource center is located on North Campus in the 626 Thurston Avenue building on the 3rd floor. The physical space includes a beautiful lounge to socialize and a multipurpose room perfect for studying or holding a meeting. Professional staff is confidential and available for individual support during business hours or by scheduling an appointment using the links on our “About Us” page. The LGBT Resource Center also hosts events and programs that provide community building and educational opportunities throughout the year. We hope to see you in our space and at our events. Feel free to reach out with any questions through the contact information in our sidebar. Give to the LGBT Resource Center One of the best ways to ensure the legacy of the LGBT Resource Center and to demonstrate our commitment to supporting an open and inclusive campus climate for LGBT students is to give to our work and leadership within the Cornell LGBTQ+ community.
