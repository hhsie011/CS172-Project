Texas Tech University Directory Raiderlink A-Z Index eLearning & Academic Partnerships Menu Search TTU eLearning & Academic Partnerships State Authorization State Authorization Texas Tech University (TTU) has been approved by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board to participate in the National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements (NC-SARA). NC-SARA is a voluntary, regional approach to state oversight of postsecondary distance education. Please see the SARA Policies and Standards document for details of specific authorized activities. California is currently the only state that is not an NC-SARA member. As a public institution, TTU is exempt from state oversight in California and not required to register with the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education (BPPE). Complaint Resolution Student complaints should first be filed with Texas Tech University (TTU). Students may ask the NC-SARA complaint resolution contact in the state in which the student is located for assistance. View a comprehensive list of NC-SARA complaint resolution contacts by state. Please note that because TTU is exempt from state oversight in California, there is no complaint resolution contact in the state of California. TTU students located in California may file complaints with TTU or the Texas Higher Education Board. Professional Licensure By law, Texas Tech is required to notify students and potential students about the university's ability to meet licensure requirements in a state.
