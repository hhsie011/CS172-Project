Our research and teaching focus on how aquatic microorganisms interact with each other and their physical/chemical environment. Applications of this work include understanding geochemical fluxes, harmful algal blooms, water quality, and sea ice ecology. The Juhl Aquatic Ecology Lab is a diverse, inclusive and safe workplace.
