She studies U.S.empire and political culture, as well as transnational Asian American history. She is interested in how commonplace ideas or ideologies in American culture have supported U.S. domestic and foreign policy and how nonstate actors have reproduced and reinforced state goals. Research Statement Her first book, America's Geisha Ally: Re-Imagining the Japanese Enemy (Harvard 2006, pbk 2010, Chinese trans, 2012, 2nd Chinese trans, 2017), examines how Americans were able to accept the Japanese as valuable Cold War allies so quickly after a brutal and racialized war. Her current book project explores the orientalism in Cold War homophobia and seeks to understand why sexual practices became important for surveillance during the advent of the national security state. She has also written on Cold War ideology and Euromodernity. Funded Research Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship/Andrew W.
