Skip to main content Skip to primary site menu Department of Mathematics MathWise MathWiSE is the Math/Applied Math Department's affinity group of Brown's university-wide Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE) group. It was founded as both a community and a resource to encourage female undergraduates to pursue studies, and ultimately careers, in the mathematical sciences. In the past, we have sponsored events such as grad school info sessions, course advice Q&A sessions, and talks by professors, as well as social events like celebrations of Pi Day and Euler's birthday. We frequently collaborate with the MathDUG, WiSE, and other academic student groups. We welcome input from the Brown community regarding event ideas. In addition, we also engage our community with events like our semesterly Girl Scouts Math Workshop. Our events are open to all genders, concentrations, and class years (including graduate students and professors) and are sponsored by the Department of Mathematics. If you are interested in organizing a MathWise group, please contact Audrey Aguiar, Coordinator of Student Affairs.
