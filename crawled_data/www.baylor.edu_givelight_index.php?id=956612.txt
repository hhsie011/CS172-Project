Illuminate, Baylor's Academic Strategic Plan, challenges us to integrate academic and teaching excellence with an uncompromising Christian identity. Developed on the framework of Pro Futuris, the strategic vision Baylor adopted several years ago, Illuminate sets the course for our future and affirms "the world needs a preeminent research university that is unambiguously Christian - where such a commitment does not imply a lack of scholarly inquiry, but rather requires scholarship and creative endeavors at the highest levels of quality to complement and inform its teaching and service." Baylor exists to demonstrate that faith is not a deterrent to scholarship. Rather, faith is the very motivation for discovering the richness of creation. It compels us to engage with issues spanning the intellectual and ideological spectrum, fostering productive dialogues that ultimately bring our discoveries to bear on the most complex problems of today. Baylor is able to guide students in the consideration of crucial issues from every possible perspective - ethical, religious, social, and intellectual - and our faculty members can serve as open and persuasive advocates for the beneficial role that faith plays in their teaching and scholarly research. Collaboration is vital to finding solutions to the immense challenges facing our world. Baylor's Illuminate calls for faculty to engage in multidisciplinary academic initiatives and contribute as mentors to undergraduates and graduate students through high-impact learning experiences. Illuminate initiatives are developed around areas where existing collaboration among Baylor faculty members is yielding results and where continued work will galvanize interest among researchers and academic leaders on our campus. Health Among Baylor’s unique opportunities is the preparation of the next generation of Christian physicians, nurses, leaders, researchers, mental health providers, and policymakers at a time when a Christian voice can provide profound guidance. Data Sciences Through this initiative, faculty and students will interact more broadly with producers of data, and develop new methods to manage and interpret life sciences data, enterprise-scale business data, and data from other domains, as well as establish best practices for data analytics, integration, management, and security. Materials Science Materials Science is a cutting-edge field with high market demand for graduates and vast external funding opportunities. Materials Science research positions Baylor as a leader in technologies that make products faster, stronger, and lighter, providing solutions for enhanced quality of life. Human Flourishing, Leadership and Ethics The research and programs developed around human flourishing, leadership, and ethics will provide a single venue dedicated to addressing the ethical, social, and technological challenges facing the contemporary world. Baylor in Latin America The Baylor in Latin America initiative positions the University to be one of the most extensively engaged faith-based universities in the nation with regard to work in the Americas, further bolstered by the University’s strong ties to Baptist and Christian life, both in Texas and abroad.
