The Campus Safety Act, also known as the Jeanne Clery Act, requires universities to report annual crime statistics, provide timely warnings of serious crimes when there may be a threat to others, and to keep a public log of campus incidents. SDSU is in full compliance with this federal mandate, and our Safety and Security Report is available to the entire campus community. You may save and/or print a copy by downloading the links below. If you would like a paper copy of the current Safety and Security Report, contact the Crime Prevention Unit at (619) 594-1985 to arrange for one to be mailed to you. 2021 2021 Campus Safety Plan 2021 ASR SDSU San Diego Campus, SDSU Imperial Valley, and SDSU Georgia Annual Systemwide Report on Hate Incidents on Campus 2020 2020 Campus Safety Plan 2020 ASR Main Campus 2020 ASR Imperial Valley 2019 2019 Main Campus 2019 IVC 5500 Campanile Drive San Diego, CA 92182 Phone: 619-594-5200 A-Z Index Campus Directory Maps Parking Employment Media Relations Give to SDSU WebPortal General Contact Network Status Strategic Plan Newsletter Sign Up Copyright Â© 2021 San Diego State University Requires SDSUid indicates links which require an SDSUid.
