Legett & was constructed in 1911 and is the oldest residence hall on campus. Judge Legett was from Abilene, Texas, and a self educated man. In 1907, he was elected president of the Board of Directors & re-elected & served until January 1911. In 1908, he wrote a letter to the Governor stating “This is the only institution in the civilized world where a number of its students are forced to live in tents.” In 1910, after Legett had left the Board, the Directors authorized construction of a new dormitory bearing his name. Judge Legett is best known as a man whose energies and talents helped turn a wilderness into a habitable and productive country. 2021 – 2022 Rates Corridor Hall $2,569semester Double Room $3,653semester Single Room Visit our rates page to see the proposed rates for 22-23. × Female Description The building houses female residents only.
