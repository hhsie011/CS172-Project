These sessions will explore non-verbal and experiential healing techniques, self-calming tools, and guide participants in incorporating mindfulness into your daily lives. This Movement Medicine webinar is a virtual setting for survivors and co-survivors to move from their headspace into full-bodied presence through awareness of our breath, gentle stretches, and guided/free movement. By incorporating mindfulness and movement therapy practices, participants will learn tools to support the body, process emotions and trauma, and release stress. The class is open to all levels of movement. Throughout the workshop, soft and fast instrumental music will be played in the background. Instructor Renk Koctruk will be sharing affirmations, invitational language, and choice-making opportunities to bring participants closer to making decisions about their body.
