Instagram Financial Aid Incoming Students 2022-2023 Financial Aid Application for U.S. Citizens & Permanent Residents The financial aid application process is the same for both residential and online programs. To apply for financial aid at HGSE you must submit the following application materials by February 11, 2022. Late applications are accepted, but priority is given to those who meet our initial deadlines. Late applications are also subject to funding availability. The 2022-2023 HGSE Financial Aid Application will be available by the end of January 2022 and is completed electronically. The HGSE Financial Aid Office will contact you with information and instructions on how to submit your Financial Aid Application, and the HGSE Financial Aid Application is due by February 11, 2022. If you prefer to apply for federal aid exclusively (Federal Work Study and loans) you must only submit the 2022-2023 FAFSA (see below). We recommend completing both the HGSE Financial Aid Application and FAFSA so you are considered for the maximum sources of aid available. The 2022-2023 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is due by February 11, 2022. The FAFSA is submitted electronically, directly to the Federal Processing Center. When completing the FAFSA, please note that parental information is not required. To ensure we receive a processed copy of your FAFSA from the Federal Student Aid Programs you must list our full school name and Federal Institution Code- E00213- on your FAFSA. If you prefer to apply for Federal aid exclusively (Federal Work Study and loans) you must only submit the 2022-2023 FAFSA. Please note: The HGSE Financial Aid Office may request copies or transcripts of your Federal Income Tax Return as necessary. There also may be supplemental application documents requested upon review of your aid application materials.
