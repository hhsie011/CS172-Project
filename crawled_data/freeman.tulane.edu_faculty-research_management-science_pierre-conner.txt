It took several years of progressive triathlons and a full 9 months of intensive 2-3 times per day and up to 20 hrs per week of programmed workouts. After 2.4 mile swim, 112 miles on the bike and full marathon of 26.2 miles, crossing the finish into the arms of the great support team of my entire family is not something I will ever forget.
