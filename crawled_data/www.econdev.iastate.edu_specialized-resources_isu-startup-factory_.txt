Our goal is to help innovators and founders move from “tech-speak” to “business-speak.” The ISU Startup Factory is a true startup incubator where business ideas are developed, examined, and validated; and where entrepreneurs learn, pivot if necessary, and grow.   Entrepreneurs receive training, resources, guidance, and access to our network of mentors, alumni, and advisors. During the 18-week program, innovators will develop their business acumen, enhance their communication skills, and learn deeply about their customers. This curriculum will prepare them to pursue non-dilutive funding as they continue developing their technology and commercialization plans. Options to graduate to one of Iowa’s accelerators or other startup programs are available, along with programming to sustain regular mentorship, supported through the ISU Startup Factory.  Copyright 2022 Economic Development & Industry Relations
