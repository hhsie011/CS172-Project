Professional Development Certificate Students from the LBJ School of Public Affairs have opportunities to formally participate in a robust array of professional development activities and programming designed to give students an edge in their job search. The Professional Development Certificate Program requires both in-person and virtual participation throughout the academic year to complement their academic experience. Gain Core Competencies The LBJ School Professional Development Program features six main competency areas that will give students an edge in their careers in public service. Competency areas were identified through in-depth research and include recruiter, alumni and student feedback. Featured competency areas include: Communication Diversity and Inclusion Career Readiness Community Engagement Data Analysis Leadership Fully Customizable Experience The program is fully customizable and integrates programming options from our partners across LBJ and the UT campus at large, to allow participants to receive certificate credit for events they may already be attending. Opportunities to Expand Network Beyond the Classroom The sessions and workshops are curated from cross-campus offerings and provide students with the opportunity to meet students, faculty and community members beyond their program. Participants convene as a cohort at key points during the program to share knowledge gained in the program and support each other, creating a sense of community among their peers. Showcase Communications Skills to Employers As part of the program, students will learn how to articulate core skills such as communications and community engagement to an employer. Students can show recruiters they have taken extra steps to ensure they're prepared for a high impact role in public service.
