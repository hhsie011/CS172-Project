Its installation platform makes it simple for homeowners to have their Level 2 chargers installed by certified electricians and simplifies electricians’ work making their services more competitive. “Lectrium is built with sustainability & hustle at our core. During the 2022 Columbia Venture Competition, we were awarded for these values. We are honored to win first place in both the BlocPower Climate Challenge and the CVC Tournament of Champions,” said founder Peter Barba. “Receiving recognition in the contest sponsored by Donnel Baird and BlocPower is an honor, and we have a lot to learn and study from BlocPower and how they improve and electrify the built environment, especially in underserved communities. Following our Climate challenge win up by winning the Columbia Tournament of Champions also felt surreal, and I am grateful to have had the chance to compete against many incredible Columbia startups.” Lectrium is also the winner of the 2022 Columbia Venture Competition, BlocPower Climate Challenge, sponsored by Columbia Entrepreneurship and the BlocPower Community Corporation.
