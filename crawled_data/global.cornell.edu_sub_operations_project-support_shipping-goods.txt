Sending or taking controlled information, technology, and items outside of the U.S., whether temporarily or permanently, is considered an export and may require a license of authorization. Depending on the goods and the destination, vendors may not be able to ship goods to you based on specific restrictions or customs fees may be prohibitive, and buying locally may be a more suitable option. The export controls team can help navigate the international procurement and shipping process.
