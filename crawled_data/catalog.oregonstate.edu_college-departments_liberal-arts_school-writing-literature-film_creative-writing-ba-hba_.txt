Students develop their expertise in reading literature in conjunction with their development of writing craft. The program objectives are to produce majors who can think and write creatively and with imaginative power. They’ll have highly trained analytical, critical, technical, and editorial skills, preparing them for graduate work in a range of fields, from the MFA to law school, or for a job market with an increasing demand for imaginative thinkers and skilled writers who can construct masterful, meaningful narratives. Major Code: 092 Analyze craft in a variety of forms, genres, and cultural contexts. Apply aesthetic principles to their own creative work. Respond to the work of peers in oral and written critiques. Use practices of revision to produce polished and/or publishable manuscripts. Recognize and interpret a wide variety of literature and genres (may include visual material and inter-cultural texts) using a range of theoretical and interpretive strategies including close reading, and write effective arguments about these texts.
