Photo by Christopher Gannon/Iowa State University. Iowa State University is home to one of the largest campus public art programs in the United States. Over 2,500 public works of art make up the Art on Campus Collection, and are located across campus in buildings, courtyards, open spaces and classrooms. Iowa State’s public art is not required to be beautiful, but it is required to be intellectually relevant to the contemporary campus and utilized in curricula. The Art on Campus Collection and Program, formalized in 1980, includes acquisition, care and maintenance in addition to scholarship and educational programming. Address The Art on Campus Collection is located on the exterior and interior of buildings across campus at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa.
