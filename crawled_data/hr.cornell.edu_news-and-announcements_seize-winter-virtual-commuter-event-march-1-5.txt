Seize the Winter – Virtual Commuter Winter Event Friday, March 5, 2021 Virtual Event Monday, March 1-Friday, March 5 Register here Let’s seize this time of the year to move more during our day and re-establish boundaries between work-life and life-life. The Virtual Commuter Winter Event will challenge you to carve out time before your workday begins to move your body, perhaps what your active commute to work used to look like. You might choose a short winter walk, Yoga, or a virtual group fitness class through Cornell Wellness or CFC. At the end of your workday your challenge is to do a little more activity, as if you were actively commuting home. Maybe you choose to do some stretching after your last meeting or you take the dog and/or the kids for a winter stroll to end your workday. Along the way you will be given pro tips to enjoy winter activity both indoors and outdoors. You’ll also get support and resources for making this behavior change via emails on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. At the end of the week you will be asked to report in with what you did for activities that bookended your workday and your reflections on how it went.
