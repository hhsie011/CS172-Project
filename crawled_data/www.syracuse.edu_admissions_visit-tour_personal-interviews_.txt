You’ll get the chance to discuss your educational experiences and interests. An interview is an opportunity for you to ask questions and learn more about Syracuse University in a personal setting. It is also a great way to help us learn more about your personal experiences and goals. Interviews are available beginning July 6 through December using Zoom. Interviews typically last about 30 minutes and will be considered in our application review process. We highly recommend students participate in a campus visit or virtual information session before scheduling a personal interview. Students may only take part in one interview. Prospective First-Year Students We are no longer conducting interviews for Fall 2022 applicants. Interviews for Fall 2023 applicants will begin in July 2022. Prospective Transfer Students Meet with a member of the Transfer Team from the Office of Admissions. Submit a request by emailing transfertosu@syr.edu . We look forward to meeting you.
