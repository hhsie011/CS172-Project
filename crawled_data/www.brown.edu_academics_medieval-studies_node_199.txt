Medieval imaginations were inspired by great cities like Constantinople, Damascus, Jerusalem, Mecca, Paris, Rome, Sãmarrã, and Toledo. New cities like Bruges arose out of commerce, learning, arts, and migrations. Some medieval societies were built around city states, whereas others eschewed the urban for alternate social formations. In this course, faculty will focus on medieval cities from diverse disciplinary perspectives. A syllabus for the course may be obtained at the office of the Program in Medieval Studies, which is located in the Annmary Brown Memorial, 21 Brown Street.
