The Division of Applied Mathematics is no exception: by its nature, our work is and always has been inter- and multi-disciplinary. Some of our faculty have degrees outside mathematics, and we interact with many disciplines at Brown and elsewhere, including engineering, computer science, finance and economics, geology, chemistry, biology, physics, cognitive science, neuroscience, and others. Our research ranges from applied and algorithmic problems to the study of fundamental mathematical questions. Our research teams include faculty, postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduate students. The main research areas represented in the Division are: Computational Biology, Mathematical Biology, Neuroscience Differential Equations and Fluid Dynamics Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing Pattern Theory and Statistics/Applied Probability and Statistics Probability and Stochastic Processes Our faculty are also involved in various intra- and interdisciplinary centers and institutes such as: Carney Institute for Brain Science Center for Computational Molecular Biology Center for Computation & Visualization Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics Lefschetz Center for Dynamical Systems Brown University Providence RI 02912 401-863-1000 Quick Navigation Visit Brown Campus Map A to Z Contact Us Footer Navigation News Events Campus Safety Accessibility Careers at Brown The campaign for building on distinction Give To Brown © Brown University Brown University For You Search Menu Mobile Site Navigation Mobile Site Navigation Home About History Association of Women in Mathematics at Brown Position Openings Contact DEI in APMA Community DEI Activities DEI Committee Newsletter Support Undergraduate Concentrations Concentration Advisors Honors Directed Reading Research and Internship Opportunities Awards AMDUG Student Groups Undergraduate Student Groups Graduate Our Advisors Prospective Masters Students Prospective PhD Students Current Students Master’s Program in Data Science Ph.D. Program in Computational Molecular Biology Graduate Student Awards Internship Opportunities Student Groups Graduate Handbook Prelim Information People Faculty Visiting Scholars Postdocs Graduate Students Staff Research Research Areas Research Institutes and Centers Research Groups Research Grants Seminars/Events PDE Seminars Probability Seminars Combinatorics Seminars Applied Mathematics Colloquium LCDS Seminars Pattern Theory Seminars SEAM Seminars Scientific Computing Seminars News This Site Only All of Brown.edu People Search Search people Advanced Search Search Close Search Research Open details for Research Bookmark this Page
