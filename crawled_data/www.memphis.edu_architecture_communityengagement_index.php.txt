It is the policy in the Department that every design studio in the Master of Architecture degree program and every design studio in the undergraduate degree programs has at least one project per semester with a community partner. In each of these, the partner must be actively engaged including meeting with students and participating in design juries. Often, multiple sections of design studios are integrated so that each community partner (and the students) has the advantage of at least two faculty members involved. This collaborative model exposes students to a more realistic, practice-based situation similar to what they will find in the professional workplace after graduation. Community Engagement Partners (past several years) TERRA Demonstration House (LEED Platinum): At least 50 community partners, especially the Henry Turley Company, City of Memphis, MLGW, and DPC Construction, were involved in this over the seven semesters of design and construction and several have continued to work with us on post-occupancy monitoring.
