Mariana Souto-Manning Mariana Souto-Manning Associate Professor of Early Childhood Education | Teachers College PubMed My Contact Info Office: 302E Zankel, Teachers College [email protected] Mariana Souto-Manning Research Interest Research Interest: Arts and Humanities Mariana Souto-Manning, Ph.D., is Associate Professor at Teachers College, Columbia University, where she serves as Director of the Doctoral Program in Curriculum and Teaching and Director of the Early Childhood Education and Early Childhood Special Education Programs. She is also Chair of the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) Research Foundation. She directs the federally-funded Quality Universally Inclusive Early Responsive Education (QUIERE) Project. Before becoming a university-based teacher educator, she was an early childhood teacher in public (pre)schools in Brazil and in the United States. Prof. Souto-Manning is an early childhood teacher educator committed to racial and cultural justice. From a critical perspective, her research examines in/equities and in/justices in early childhood teaching and teacher education, critically recentering methodologies and pedagogies on the lives and experiences of people of color and other historically minoritized communities. She consider questions such as "critical for whom?" and "according to whom?" as she investigates issues pertaining to equitable teaching and learning, focusing on languaging and literacy practices in pluralistic settings. As she considers issues of colonization, assimilation, and oppression in schooling and society, she critically examines theoretical and methodological issues and dilemmas of doing research with communities of color. Souto-Manning regularly collaborates with teachers and engages in community-engaged research. She has published seven books, including the 2016 winner of the American Educational Studies Association Critics’ Choice Award, Reading, Writing, and Talk: Inclusive Teaching Strategies for Diverse Learners, K-2 (with Jessica Martell, a NYC public school teacher). In addition to books and book chapters, she has published over 60 articles in journals such as Linguistics and Education, International Journal of Qualitative Studies in Education, Journal of Teacher Education, Teaching and Teacher Education, Research in the Teaching of English, and Teachers College Record. She is the recipient of a number of research awards, including the 2011 American Educational Research Association Division K Innovations in Research on Diversity in Teacher Education Award and the 2017 AERA Teaching and Teacher Education (Division K) Mid-Career Award.
