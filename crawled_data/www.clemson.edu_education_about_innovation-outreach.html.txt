In collaboration with our state-wide partners, we find solutions that lead to success in education, industry and community well-being. From new degrees and certificates to professional development, internships and educational pathways, we work with school districts, universities, state entities and others to address teacher recruitment, preparation and retention – understanding that they are keys to this success. Our alumni also proudly serve throughout South Carolina - adding their expertise to make their schools and communities strong. We gladly engage in all of these efforts as part of Clemson's land-grant mission to serve South Carolina and its citizens. Recent Innovations Certificate of Online Teaching The College of Education offers a four-course Certificate of Online Teaching to help equip teachers and schools as they adapt to an ever-evolving digital learning environment. The certificate addresses foundational concepts such as instructional design and development, engagement strategies, and data collection and evaluation. In response to needs brought about by the COVID pandemic, two districts in South Carolina's Florence County provided an opportunity for cohorts of their teachers to participate in the program together. Ed.D. in Education Systems Improvement Science The Education Systems Improvement Science program is an applied doctoral research program designed to prepare PK-12 practitioners to meet complex challenges facing education. Students develop a knowledge base and research skills to design innovative solutions that benefit students, families, and communities in South Carolina and beyond. Offered in partnership with The Citadel, Coastal Carolina University and Winthrop University, the program offers Ed.S. graduates from these institutions a pathway to earning the Ed.D. that speeds their overall time of completion and spreads the impact of the program across the state in both rural and urban areas. Expressway to Tiger Town Expessway to Tiger Town is a partnership with Greenville County Schools and Greenville Technical College that opens a seamless pathway from high school to a degree in education from the College of Education. Students to take dual credit courses in high school and then spend one year at Greenville Tech and two years at the College of Education, allowing them to receive a bachelor’s degree in just three years. Students can spend an additional year at Clemson and earn a master’s degree through the college’s teacher residency program. The partnership is designed to address the teacher shortage and help future teachers save money on tuition and reduce student debt. Human Capital Education and Development Human capital is about the knowledge, skills and abilities essential for high performance in work and career in our knowledge- and technology-based economy. The hybrid (online and in-person) program is open to first-year freshmen, major changers, Bridge students, and technical college and other transfer students. This degree program includes an online option, flexible pathways of entry and exit, is industry focused, and leads to high-demand jobs. Perfecting Your Roar Understanding that teacher preparation and mentoring help keep teachers in classrooms, the College of Education created Perfecting Your Roar, a professional development program designed to support teachers during their first year in the classroom. The program offers seminars that address timely issues such as classroom and time management – as well as coaching by trained mentor teachers. The program is held in collaboration with partnering school districts. Teaching Fellows The College of Education is a proud participant in the South Carolina Teaching Fellows program. Sponsored by the Center for Educator Recruitment, Retention and Advancement, the program recruits talented high school seniors into the teaching profession and gives them state-funded fellowships to pursue an education degree and teach in South Carolina schools. The program has given the College of Education the opportunity to attract even more top students and prepare them to be change-agents in the state's classrooms and schools – addressing the critical issues of teacher recruitment and student success. Teacher Residency The Teacher Residency program – the first university-led program of its kind in South Carolina – allows students to complete a bachelor’s and master’s degree in five years, spending the fifth year in an extended, year-long student teaching experience with a trained teacher-leader. The program is already proving to be effective in teacher retention, with 100% of the first graduating class returning for a second year in the classroom.
