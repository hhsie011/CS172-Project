The curricula emphasize the management of human resources, managerial problem solving, and decision making. Within the management degree program, students choose to major in general management or human resource management consistent with their specific interests. The overall objective of these curricula is to prepare students for entry-level positions in small and large organizations, leading to line or staff management careers in either the public or private sector. Many graduates enter jobs as managerial associates, sales associates, or human resource management professionals. The department also offers a combined BS-HRM//MBA pathway that allows highly qualified undergraduate students in the human resource management major the opportunity to accelerate their coursework and take up to nine semester hours of graduate coursework, which may be counted toward both the BS and MBA degrees. A detailed description of the MBA program can be found in the Graduate Bulletin. Computer Skills Competency All undergraduates at Florida State University must demonstrate basic computer skills competency prior to graduation. As necessary computer competency skills vary from discipline to discipline, each major determines the courses needed to satisfy this requirement.
