The programming comp is completed in your first or third semester and is made up of a series of projects assigned in CSCI 0190. We strongly encourage you to attempt the comp in your first semester so you can fill in any gaps in your programming skills if you can't complete the comp on your first try. You must complete the programming comp by the end of your second year. In the past, there were five written exams in addition to the programming comp and research project, but these have been replaced by course requirements.
