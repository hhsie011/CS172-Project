I also truly feel the unparalleled 'people factor' of the folks who work within BC. Quality of utmost caliber and generosity of their talent, time and ideas. I loved meeting them back at school and now. Why did you get involved in your local chapter?: I love Boston College. I love the commitment to 'bettering' people's lives within the BC culture, and I was always very impressed with the folks who run the NYC chapter-their agileness to host on topic and current events and create a warm environment where everyone felt comfortable to join and get involved. What are your local favorites in your city?: I love Canoe restaurant, Aria, Houston's, Grapes and Grains, Chops, and more. I am 'newly' relocated here following the COVID situation affecting New York City and the company I worked for, so I have many places I want to try and I will have word back to you! I enjoy a gym routine and would like to try a pretty walk in the mountains. I am lucky to have irreplaceable friends from highschool and even from elementary school who stay in touch with. I enjoy volunteering for the Atlanta Ballet and would like to find a soup kitchen or other ways to get involved. I enjoy movies, exercise, reading, music, and art. Sports are fun to have on and to keep current with as well. I enjoy baking, reading recipes, and trying to cook. Ha ha ha. Fun Fact: I love music, art, and Broadway shows.
