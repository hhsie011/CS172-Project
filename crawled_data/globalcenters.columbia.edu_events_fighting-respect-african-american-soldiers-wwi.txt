"Fighting For Respect: African Americans in WWI" tells a compelling story of the African American soldiers who fought for democracy abroad in segregated US Army troops. Convinced that their much-praised heroism overseas would translate to civil rights at home, the returning veterans and their communities instead became the target of unspeakable violence waged by white supremacists during the fiery Red Summer of 1919. The complexity of this gripping story is retold through rare archival film footage, letters written home from the Front, and incisive commentary from academic experts. In addition, the focus on the experiences of several distinguished soldiers provides thought-provoking insight as to how African American participation abroad advanced the fight for equality, respect, and freedom in the United States. The film screening will be followed by a live concert featuring bassist Darryl Hall, vocalist Leslie Lewis, and pianist Vincent Bourgeyx.
