Duckworth Scholars Studio Special Collections Research Center Temple Rome Library Charles Library 1900 N. 13th Street Philadelphia, PA 19122 (215) 204-8212 asktulibrary@temple.edu Charles Library opened in August 2019, replacing Samuel L. Paley Library as Temple University’s Main Campus library. Named for entrepreneur and university trustee Steve Charles, KLN ’80, Charles Library is a stunning, state-of-the-art environment for interconnection and collaboration among disciplines as well as communities at Temple and across Philadelphia. Designed by internationally renowned architecture firm Snøhetta, in collaboration with local design and construction firm Stantec, Charles Library is filled with a variety of specialized and innovative spaces, including the Loretta C. Duckworth Scholars Studio and the Special Collections Research Center. For the first time ever, our Main Campus library is also home to a dedicated graduate student and faculty area, the Student Success Center, and Temple University Press. Charles Library also houses an abundance of flexible instruction and multipurpose rooms, reading areas and student study spaces, and a cafe and spacious 24/7 area. The fourth floor holds our browsing collection of approximately 180,000 volumes on open shelving. 1.5 million circulating volumes and 18,000 linear feet of special collections materials are housed in an Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS), also known as BookBot, from which items can be pulled for pickup.
