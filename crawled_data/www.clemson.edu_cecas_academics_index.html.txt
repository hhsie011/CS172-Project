Magazine Outreach Ways to Give Clemson Home College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences Current: Academics Your Future Begins Here Preparing students for a career in the 21st century means providing much more than specialized technical knowledge. Engineers and scientists must recognize the social and business implications of their work; they must be able to communicate their ideas, work effectively in teams, and be willing and qualified to provide leadership in solving society’s problems. Our college's unique blend of hands-on research, mentoring, work experience, and campus involvement all play a key role in shaping the student experience and preparing you for a vibrant career. Schedule a Tour Virtual Tour intro-arrow Hands-On Research Engaged learning allows students to solve local, national, and even international problems through team-based investigations. Though often led by a faculty mentor, some inquiries are regularly initiated by the students themselves, allowing participants to develop the ability to reflect critically while honing essential communication and presentation skills.
