Both policies and guidelines work their way through the appropriate sub-council or sub-councils, then go to the presidents council for approval. Approval at that level is all that is required to establish guidelines, which generally describe the process of policy implementation. Policies themselves must go on to the full board for consideration after being approved by the presidents council. All TBR Institutions are required to follow system policies and guidelines and incorporate them into their campus policies and guidelines. As the need arises, policies and guidelines are updated and re-posted to the website. Index Codes The following index is provided as an aid to finding the correct policy or guideline.
