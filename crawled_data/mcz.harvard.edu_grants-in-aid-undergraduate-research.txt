Projects in any subject area are eligible for support, although priority may be given to projects that utilize MCZ, HUH, or AA research collections, laboratories and other facilities, and to related fieldwork. Funds from the HUH are primarily available to support projects in the field of plant biology; funds from the AA primarily target research that utilizes its living collections. Projects that facilitate senior honors theses or associated preliminary studies are particularly encouraged. Awards range from $500 to $4,000 and may provide support for the academic year (fall and spring semesters) or summer. Awards support laboratory and field equipment and supplies, airfare and/or local travel to a research site, or a stipend during the semester.
