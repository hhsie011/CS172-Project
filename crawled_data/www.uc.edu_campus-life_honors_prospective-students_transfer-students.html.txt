If you are a current UC student enrolled in a baccalaureate program and wish to apply to the University Honors Program you must apply through the transition process. Applications from students who are transferring to UC are accepted year-round. Transfer students must apply at least one month before they begin courses at the University of Cincinnati. University Honors accepts only one application per candidate each academic year. Applications are now open for the Fall 2022 term. To be eligible for Fall 2022, you must submit your application by July 25. All decisions will be made after this deadline. To be eligible, applicants must have a minimum cumulative college GPA of 3.2 or above and be admitted into a baccalaureate program by a college at the University of Cincinnati. Currently, the University Honors Program is unable to admit to UC Online students. UC Online programs are completely online programs. If you are unsure if you qualify, please reach out to us before completing the application. Admission is very competitive and is based on the application, academic accomplishment, and involvement outlined in the resume. Meeting the eligibility is not a guarantee of admission to the University Honors Program. Questions? Contact us at honors@uc.edu or 513-556-6254.
