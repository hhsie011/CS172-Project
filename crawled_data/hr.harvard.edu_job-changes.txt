An overview of job changes, promotions, transfers, and other types of pay are outlined below. Job Changes/Reevaluation When substantive, measurable changes occur in responsibilities, a job review is in order. Reviews are handled at the local level through the HR office and may be requested by a supervisor, HR officer, or an employee. Once the request is submitted to HR, decisions are typically made within a reasonably short time period. In most cases, a salary increase is granted when a person is reclassified to a higher grade. Promotion A promotion is when an employee advances to a position that is classified at a higher salary grade, or in certain circumstances, an acknowledgment of significant greater responsibilities within the same grade. A salary increase is typically appropriate at the time of the promotion, based upon an evaluation of relevant experience, performance, relative position in the new salary range, internal equity, and external competitiveness. Transfer A transfer is when an employee moves to a position outside his or her current department. A transfer can be lateral (no change in grade), a promotion (increase in grade), or demotion (decrease in grade). Salary changes may or may not be warranted in the case of a transfer. Types of Pay In addition to regular pay, the following types of pay may be appropriate in certain circumstances: Bonuses Employees may receive bonus pay to reward exceptional work, initiative, or achievement. Bonuses depend on local guidelines and budgetary considerations in consultation with the local HR office. Extra work Extra work is Harvard work that falls beyond a regular job assignment. If the extra work is performed in a department other than the staff member’s home department, prior approval should be obtained from the home department. The work must clearly fall outside normal assignments, be performed outside the employee's normal work schedule, and not interfere with regular responsibilities. If the additional work is comparable to the staff member’s regular duties, normal pay rate apply. If the additional work is significantly different, the HR office should recommend an appropriate pay rate. Temporary adjustment Under certain circumstances it may be appropriate to make a temporary salary adjustment. This may happen when an employee temporarily assumes the duties of an additional employee or that of someone in a higher-level position. Once the temporary situation ends, the employee’s salary will be restored to the original rate. Union Members Employees who are members of a union at Harvard should consult their contract for addition information on Meal Allowance, Shift Differential and Overtime, as appropriate.
