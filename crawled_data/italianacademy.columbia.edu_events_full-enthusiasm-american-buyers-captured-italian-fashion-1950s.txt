Within just a few seasons, his presentations were dazzling hundreds of guests in the nearby Palazzo Pitti. His runway was seen as crucial to Italy’s boom in clothing exports, which shot up by 500% between 1950 and 1955. This exhibition of vintage photos traces this remarkable and little-known story.
