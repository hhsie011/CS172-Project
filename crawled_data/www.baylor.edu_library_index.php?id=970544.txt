Third Street Waco, TX 76706 What is Interlibrary Services (ILS)? It is physically and fiscally impossible for the Baylor Libraries to own every document or information resource needed to support all scholarly activities of its clients. Interlibrary Services is a dedicated team of men and women in the Libraries who try to locate the desired items in other collections around the world and then try to obtain them for temporary use by our clients. What is OsoFast? OsoFast is Baylor's interlibrary loan management system. Baylor students, faculty, and staff only need to have a valid Bear ID and password to access OsoFast. Distance education students now only need to use a single interface to request the information sources they need, including items owned by the Baylor Libraries.
