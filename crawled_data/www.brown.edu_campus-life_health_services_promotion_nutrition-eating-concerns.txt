We know which foods fuel us so we can perform at our best, and the ones we eat simply because we enjoy them. Unfortunately, we live in a diet culture that promotes the idea that there are “good” and “bad” foods, and tries to dictate what our bodies should look like. Diet culture disrupts our trust to know what is best for our own health and wellness. A Registered Dietitian Nutritionist can help you discern nutrition facts from fiction, learn to trust your body’s cues again, and get off the diet roller coaster for good (or perhaps avoid it in the first place!). Does your day feel consumed by thoughts about food, exercise, and/or counting calories? Have you missed out on fun social events because you’ve found yourself preoccupied by thoughts about food? Do you categorize foods as healthy or unhealthy, and feel guilty for violating self-imposed food rules? Are you concerned that your eating patterns have become disordered? The Registered Dietitian Nutritionist in Health Services can help. Nutrition visits are confidential and covered under your Health Services fee, so insurance is not billed, and there is no session limit. To schedule an appointment, please call 401-863-3558.

Intuitive Eating is an evidence-based, mind-body health approach, comprised of 10 Principles and created by two dietitians, Evelyn Tribole and Elyse Resch in 1995. It is a weight-neutral model with a validated assessment scale and over 90 studies to date (Tribole 2017). It’s thrilling to see all the research and gives me great hope. Intuitive Eating is a dynamic integration between mind and body. The principles work by either cultivating or removing obstacles to body awareness, a process known as interoceptive awareness. Essentially, Intuitive Eating is a personal process of honoring health by listening and responding to the direct messages of the body in order to meet your physical and psychological needs. by Evelyn Tribole, MS, RDN, CEDRD-S Read more about intuitive eating What is The Health at Every SizeⓇ Approach? The framing for a Health At Every Size (HAES®) approach comes out of discussions among healthcare workers, consumers, and activists who reject both the use of weight, size, or BMI as proxies for health, and the myth that weight is a choice. The HAES model is an approach to both policy and individual decision-making. It addresses broad forces that support health, such as safe and affordable access. It also helps people find sustainable practices that support individual and community well-being. The HAES approach honors the healing power of social connections, evolves in response to the experiences and needs of a diverse community, and grounds itself in a social justice framework. by the Association for Size Diversity and Health (ASDAH) Read about the HAESⓇ Principles Get Involved Meet Our Staff About Us Make an Appointment Brown University BWell Health Promotion Health and Wellness Brown University Box 1928 450 Brook Street Providence, Rhode Island, 02912 Phone 401-863-2794 Fax 401-863-7953 [email protected] © 2022 Brown University Connect: [email protected] Related Offices Brown EMS Counseling and Psychological Services Health Services Social Media BWell on Facebook SHAG on Facebook BURP on Facebook Health Services on Facebook
