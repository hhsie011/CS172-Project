The Florida State University Percussion Studio is comprised of 24 percussion majors (Performance and Music Education) at the Doctoral, Master's and Undergraduate levels, and is capped at that number to provide maximal learning opportunities for our students. Typically we have four graduate students in residence, all of whom are Graduate Teaching Assistants in charge of Instrument Storage, Applied Lessons/Percussion Methods class, FSU Percussion Ensemble/Chamber Ensemble coaching, and the Marching Chiefs Big 8 Drum Line. We average 20 undergraduate majors, or roughly five new students a year. Admission to our program is highly competitive at both the graduate and undergraduate levels (average of 40-50 graduate applicants and 35-45 undergraduates annually), and opportunities for performance with our nationally-acclaimed symphonic, jazz, and world music ensembles are open to all through auditions at the beginning of each semester. Additional performance opportunities exist with the Tallahassee Symphony Orchestra through annual auditions, as well as other regional per-service orchestras. Our Percussion Ensemble has been a winner of the PASIC 2007 and 2011 International Percussion Ensemble Competitions, resulting in showcase performances in Columbus, OH and Indianapolis, IN, and a select group of students accompanied Dr. Parks on his Carnegie Hall solo debut and East Coast tour in 2007. Volume One and Volume Two: Not Far From Here, recorded by the FSU Percussion Ensemble, were released in 2009 and 2013, and their highly-anticipated new CD Volume Three: Ten Windows was released in August of 2015 with recording in progress on Volume Four: Unknown Kind (2018).
