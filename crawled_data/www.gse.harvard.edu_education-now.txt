Widen Layout: wide Recent Episode Learning and Living in Polarized Times | May 18, 2022 Hosted by: Uche Amaechi As the nation has become more polarized politically, how are we talking with young people — at home, at school, on college campuses — about the values of democracy, about bridging our differences, and about finding common ground? How are we working to help young people make connections with and care for others who think very differently than they do? How can we learn to engage in the kind of “hard” caring that is central to a healthy society? Join us as we develop a new form of dialogue for our homes, schools, and communities — one that acknowledges divides while finding productive ways to cross them. Speakers Tania Israel, Professor of Counseling Psychology, University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB); author of Beyond Your Bubble: How to Connect Across the Political Divide Richard Weissbourd, Faculty Director, Human Development and Psychology, and Director, Making Caring Common Project, HGSE WATCH VIDEO Widen Layout: wide Our Hosts Uche Amaechi Lecturer on Education Junlei Li Saul Zaentz Senior Lecturer in Early Childhood Education Francesca Purcell Senior Lecturer Education Now features a rotating trio of faculty hosts who focus on topics in early childhood development, K-12 schooling, and higher education.
