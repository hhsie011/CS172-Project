Home Offices Diversity, Inclusion and Community Engagement Diversity, Inclusion, and Community Engagement The Miller School of Medicine is committed to fostering diversity. Diversity enriches the medical environment by building mutual respect and teamwork to prepare students, faculty members and staff for citizenship in an increasingly complex society. It strengthens the environment by providing opportunities for communication between people of varied backgrounds, promoting personal growth and a healthier community by encouraging critical thinking and challenging preconceptions. Furthermore, as a diverse community, the school is better prepared to face the challenges of the future, in advancing medical knowledge with research, and in dealing with the clinical needs of our society. Diversity Statement We believe in liberty and justice for all. We stand with our black students, faculty, staff, and every ally of the black community against systemic racism, racial injustice, senseless violence, and oppression. Task Force on Racial Justice The University of Miami Miller School of Medicine's Task Force on Racial Justice was created in 2020 in response to the political and racial climate that has permeated the country and our medical school.
