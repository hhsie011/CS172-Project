Graduate study in this department is geared toward earning a PhD in the History of Art and Architecture, and many areas of visual culture from the ancient world through the present. Work in the department of the History of Art and Architecture at Brown is conceived as an interdisciplinary undertaking, in which students are encouraged to become familiar with the variety of methodologies and practices that have historically been, and continue to be productive in our fields. We also maintain a longstanding commitment to museum studies and the study of objects through a close working relationship with the Museum of the Rhode Island School of Design. Interested students in this department have the opportunity to hold internships and (in the case of graduate students) proctorships at the museum.
