Full Text Research Research Overview Mary Gluck is an intellectual-cultural historian of nineteenth- and twentieth-century Europe, with special expertise in Central Europe and France. She has published extensively on Georg Lukacs, modernism, and avant-garde culture and the Jewish Question. Her latest book focuses on The Invisible Jewish Budapest: Metopolitan Culture at the Fin de Siecle. Research Statement Mary Gluck's research brings into critical juxtaposition a number of distinct, yet interrelated, disciplinary areas: the intellectual history of avant-garde art, the social history of urban modernity and bohemia, and the cultural history of the Jewish Question. These themes were already implicit in her first monograph on Georg Lukacs and His Generation, which focused on the genesis of a uniquely Central European form of modernist culture in pre-World War I Budapest. Exploring the close interrelationships between avant-garde aesthetics and radical politics in the context of growing anti-Semitism, the book raised a number of broad historical questions that led to subsequent research agendas. One of these was the general problematics of modernism both as an aesthetic practice and as a cultural experience associated with modern urban life. This inquiry resulted in a series of articles on different facets of European modernism and eventually in a sustained study of Parisian experimental culture entitled, Popular Bohemia: Modernism and Urban Culture in Nineteenth-Century Paris. A second, parallel research interest has been the relationship between urban modernity and the "Jewish Question" in fin-de-siecle Hungary, which has been published as The Invisible Jewish Budapest: Metropolitan Culture at the fin de Siecle.
