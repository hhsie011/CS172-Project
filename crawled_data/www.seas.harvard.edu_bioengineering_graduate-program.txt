Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences highly interdisciplinary. Students are free to collaborate and interact closely with other labs, centers and schools across the Harvard engineering and medical campuses. Our mission is to identify and attract the most promising students to form a dynamic and diverse community, and to shape them into visionary scholars, innovative educators, and creative leaders. Within the bioengineering program we focus on bioinspired robotics and computing; biomechanics and motor control; cell and tissue engineering, biomaterials and therapeutics. Graduate education is focused on individualized programs tailored to the interests, needs, and background of the student. Students are integral to the interdisciplinary and integrated approach to design, discovery and innovation. As such, students from diverse technical backgrounds are encouraged and welcomed to join us. Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences offers a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D) degree in Engineering Sciences: Bioengineering, conferred through the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
