It was founded in 2018 by a group of like-minded students from across the globe, representing the different programs of the Graduate School of Architecture Planning and Preservation. LatinGSAPP recognizes the importance and timeliness of impactful practice and research in the region of Latin America and by Latin Americans across the globe. Our primary objective is to raise awareness of this work and encourage cooperative involvement. We are interested in weaving a cross-functional network that facilitates collaborative thinking by connecting existing areas of expertise within and outside of the school. In turn, we provide support to that network by engaging with their projects and expanding their reach, enhancing opportunities for future cooperation. Similarly, we are focused on connecting with fellow Latin American organizations at Columbia University and beyond to find potential overlaps. LatinGSAPP seeks to reinforce its network by developing a continuous framework of strategies and events that can grow over the years. Some of our previous events include panel discussions, round table talks, social hours, happy hours, and meet-ups with other student organization. We are currently looking for fellow students from other programs to join the Latin GSAPP Association, so please contact us if you are interested! Visit our facebook group for more details.
