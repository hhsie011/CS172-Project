Texas Tech University Directory Raiderlink A-Z Index Graduate School Menu Search Giving Priorities Tech's continued prominence as leader in innovation and in helping meet nation's demand for a highly skilled workforce depends on the strength of our graduate programs. We must continue to recruit and support the very best students and assure that they acquire the skills they need to succeed while at Tech and after they graduate. To make this happen, we must grow our scholarship and fellowship offerings and continue to enhance our professional and career development programming. Fund for Excellence Preparing our graduate students with the professional skill set to be successful while pursuing their degree program and making them more marketable upon graduation is a signature element of the graduate experience at Tech. Gifts to the fund for excellence support professional and career development activities as well as travel to professional meetings and research/scholarly activities for graduate students across all academic disciplines. Graduate Scholarships and Fellowships Competitive stipends are essential to attracting the most talented individuals to our graduate programs. Adequate financial support also is critical for students to complete their degree. At present, Tech only supports about 30% of its graduate students. Increased support for scholarships and fellowships is paramount for Tech retaining its national competitiveness. Gifts are used to provide scholarships, summer support, and recruiting fellowships. Endowed fellowships provide a lasting legacy. Ways to Give Outright Gifts Gifts may be cash/checks, securities, investments, or appraised estate.
