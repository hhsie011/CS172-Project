Through the Hire Brown First initiative any internal candidate who applies to and meets the minimum qualifications of the position will be eligible to receive an interview. If an internal candidate is not selected for the position, the hiring manager will be responsible for providing feedback to the internal candidate to aid development opportunities. As a best practice, it is recommended that an internal candidate be in their current role for 9-12 months before seeking another opportunity. It is important to note that employees who are transferred or promoted through this process will serve a new three month probationary period. The possibilities are endless when you take the initiative to learn and grow as a professional at Brown University. The University provides extensive opportunities to develop your skills and grow—within or beyond your current role—throughout your entire Brown career.
