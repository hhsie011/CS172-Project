Please note the caveat in the policy below for all doctoral candidates planning to attend University Commencement Ceremonies. What is a Certified vs. Non-Certified Commencement? Certified Commencement requires a student to complete all degree requirements and be certified for the degree in order to participate in a commencement ceremony. Non-Certified Commencement provides the opportunity for a student close to completing all degree requirements to participate in a commencement ceremony. Participation in Commencement Ceremonies Students seeking a bachelor's, master's or Education Specialist degree, who were enrolled in or have completed sufficient coursework to complete degree requirements in a term, may participate as a degree candidate in commencement ceremonies at the end of that term. Since grades are frequently due following the commencement ceremonies, students are eligible to walk in the ceremony unless they have withdrawn from the term. Doctoral candidates, in the following programs, must be certified as having completed their degree in order to participate in commencement ceremonies at the end of a term: PhD PsyD EdD DMA DSC Revised October 13, 2021 Commencement Participation Questions Please contact your degree planner if you have questions regarding your eligibility to walk.
