His book-in-progress on the subject — Sounds as They Are — contributes to the fields of analytic aesthetics, music theory, and sound studies. He comes to Dartmouth after having taught music theory and composition at Harvard University for eight years, and having held posts as Valentine Visiting Professor of Music at Amherst College and Visiting Research Fellow at the Royal Academy of Music, London. He has given invited lectures at the Paris Conservatoire, the Centre for Music and Science at Cambridge University, Harvard University, The United States Consulate Shanghai Division, The Royal Academy of Music in London, The Shanghai Conservatory of Music, East China Normal University, The Steinhardt School at New York University, The New England Conservatory, Yale University, Boston University, Berklee College of Music, The University of York, and the Schweizerische Musikforschende Gesellschaft at the Hochscule, Luzern, Switzerland.

Recent papers presented at SMT/AMS 2016 in Vancouver, SMT/AMS 2018 in San Antonio, SMT 2019 in Columbus, and SMT/AMS 2020.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Music Undergraduate Music at Dartmouth Major and Minor Courses Spring 2022 Summer 2022 Fall 2022 Winter 2023 Spring 2023 Honors Honors Projects Funding Graduate Overview Apply People Current Students Performance Overview Individual Instruction Student Recitals Performance Laboratories Hopkins Center Ensembles Practice Rooms Instruments and Lockers Foreign Study Overview London FSP Vienna FSP News & Events News Events Arts Awards Leonard J.
