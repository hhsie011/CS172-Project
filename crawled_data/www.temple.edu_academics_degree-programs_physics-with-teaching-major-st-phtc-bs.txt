This 124-credit-hour, interdisciplinary bachelor's degree is offered through Temple’s innovative TUteach program. Physics with Teaching As a Physics Major, you’ll follow the same curricular requirements as the Bachelor of Arts in Physics. Over four years, you’ll study the fundamental principles of the discipline as well as the relevant mathematics key to understanding different physical models. You'll learn to teach in a traditional classroom setting and labs, and you'll gain the application skills needed to solve problems in specialized areas of physics, including atomic physics, classical and quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, optics and wave phenomena, statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, and special relativity. Temple TUteach TUteach is a collaboration between the College of Science and Technology and the College of Education and Human Development. TUteach integrates a secondary school (grades 7 through 12) mathematics or science teaching track so you can become eligible to take the Praxis certification exam upon graduation.
