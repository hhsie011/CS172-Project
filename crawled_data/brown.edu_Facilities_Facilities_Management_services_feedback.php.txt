We encourage all members of the Brown community to utilize our on-line system for submitting service requests. Our on-line application, Facilities Self Service (FSS), offers a web interface allowing customers to create, submit, and track the status of each service request they submit. Customers may also contact the Service Response Center directly for submitting service requests. In the event of a facility related EMERGENCY call the Service Response Center immediately at (401) 863-7800. The Service Response Center evaluates each service request upon receipt, prioritizes the request, and distributes the request to the appropriate Facilities Management area that will act on the request. Once the service request is scheduled it becomes a work order. Utilizing FSS, each customer may login and track the status, review histories, and perform queries of their service requests and work orders. In addition, email notifications are sent to customers to confirm receipt of each work order and to indicate when each work order has been closed. When submitting a service request you should be prepared to provide the following information: First and last name of the requestor Alternate requestor or contact person Telephone number The exact location of the work to be performed A full description of the work requested Time frame in which work is to begin and be completed Submit Service Request & Event Support Request Customer Service Operations and Maintenance Planning, Design & Construction Sustainability Event and Conference Real Estate Custodial and Moves More...
