Official Transcript Details According to the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, the transcript is “the official document issued by an institution with student information that is a complete and accurate reflection of a student’s academic career. It includes information such as GPA, semesters of attendance, courses taken, grades and credit hours awarded, degrees received, academic standing, academic honors, and transfer information.” The OSU official transcript is issued by the Office of the Registrar at the request of current and former students. Paper transcripts are available to former students for $8 via standard USPS shipping, with rush shipping options available for an additional charge. Expedited eTranscripts are available for $6 and are the fastest option for official transcript delivery. See our transcript ordering page for ordering details. We no longer process transcripts requests received via paper, email or fax. Current students pay mandatory academic records and maintenance fees and can request paper transcripts with standard USPS shipping at no cost from the student Self-Service system. Enrolled students can also purchase expedited eTranscripts or paper transcripts with rush shipping. See registrar.okstate.edu/transcripts/ for transcript ordering details. The legend on the back of the transcript explains the grades and symbols used on the transcript. It includes some of the following information.
