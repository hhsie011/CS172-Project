After Hours Campus Access Policy **This policy is suspended until further notice given enhanced restrictions described above** History Enacted April 2013; available annually in the Barnard College Annual Security Report. Executive Summary Access to the Barnard College main campus will be restricted during late-night hours to individuals holding valid Barnard College or Columbia University identification credentials. The main campus is bounded by Broadway, Claremont Avenue, 116th Street, and 120th Street. Reason for the Policy In order to protect the safety and security of the college community, and in consideration of the very limited number of college-sponsored classes or events during late-night hours, campus access will be monitored and controlled. Who is Responsible for this Policy Barnard College Community Safety. Who Is Affected by this Policy All persons seeking access to the campus between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. Policy Statement On a daily basis, beginning at 11:00 p.m., access will be restricted to the main gate at 117th and Broadway and the link gate at 119th and Claremont. All persons entering the campus must pass through those gates. Access will be permitted only to those presenting a valid Barnard College or Columbia University identification badge. Guests without such credentials are permitted with an escort; escorts must hold a valid Barnard College or Columbia University identification badge. Procedure At 11:00 p.m., Community Safety will close all gates and access to the campus, with the exception of the main gate at 117th and Broadway and the link gate at 119th and Claremont. At the main gate, one leaf of the gate will be closed. Any person seeking to enter the campus after 11:00 p.m. will be requested to present valid Barnard College or Columbia University I.D. Upon validation of the I.D., the person will be permitted to enter the campus. If a person does not have a valid I.D., they will not be permitted access.
