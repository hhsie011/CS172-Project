International Transfer & Post-Baccalaureate Applicants Spring Application Deadline: November 15 Fall Application Deadline: June 1 STEP 2: CHOOSE YOUR APPLICATION METHOD Baylor Online Application Common Application ApplyTexas Regardless of your application choice, you must create a goBAYLOR account to track your application status. This is where we will communicate what is needed to complete your application file and additional enrollment steps for accepted students. PRO TIP: Whatever email address you apply with will be used to communicate important information throughout the application cycle and in the summer after you graduate. We recommend using a personal, non-school-affiliated email address that you will check often and use long-term. STEP 3: REVIEW THE APPLICATION CHECKLIST Your goBAYLOR account will show exactly what items we have received and what is needed to complete your file by the deadline. 1. High School Transcripts We accept high school transcripts in these two ways: OFFICIAL: Official transcripts can be mailed from your high school in a sealed and signed envelope or sent digitally through a secure electronic source (Slate.org, Parchment, CommonApp, or TRex). UNOFFICIAL: Unofficial transcripts are sufficient to complete your application file, however, please note that final enrollment at Baylor is contingent upon receipt of an official transcript. If you would like to submit an unofficial transcript to complete your application file, simply upload a scanned copy in your goBAYLOR account or email admissions@baylor.edu and include as an attachment. Transcripts or mark sheets must include: years of enrollment, course titles and all marks earned for each course for 6 semesters. If your school's education system only has three years of secondary school, please have the previous year submitted as well. Transcripts should be submitted in the original language and accompanied by an official literal English translation. Although original documents are preferred, certified photocopies are acceptable when a signature and the stamp from the school or government official is included. Copies received through fax or email are not considered official. Students can self submit transcripts as long as they are in official, sealed envelopes from their secondary school. Applicants from schools with external exams or leaving certificates should have their exams or certificates submitted to Baylor directly from the testing agency (IGCSE, GCE, WAEC, CBSE, IB, etc.). If you are unsure about which transcripts or exams are required for your country's education system, see our Required Secondary School Credentials by Country page. If you have not yet taken your examination, your admission may be contingent upon our receipt of your exam results. If using outside credential evaluators, Baylor will only accept evaluations from Educational Credential Evaluators (ECE) or World Education Services (WES). If you choose to use one of these services, Baylor requires copies of the original transcripts to accompany the evaluation. 2. Submission of Documentation Electronic copies are only official if sent from TRex (for Texas schools), Parchment or through the Common App. Mailed documents should be sent to: Undergraduate Admissions One Bear Place #97056 Waco, TX 76798-7056 3. Official SAT/ACT Scores Important Note: Students are not required to submit standardized test scores for admission. When you apply, you will be required to choose the following when responding to the “Preferred testing plan” question: “I opt in to having my test scores reviewed for admission.” OR “I opt out.” The decision to apply with or without test scores should be carefully thought through and is considered final. However, given the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, Baylor will make every effort to be as flexible with applicants as possible. If an applicant has previously submitted test scores to Baylor but indicates on the application that they would not like their scores considered, test scores will not be viewed during application review. International students who apply without test scores have the option to complete an interview as part of the application process so that we may get to know you better. Learn more about our Test Optional policy. We accept SAT or ACT scores in these three ways: SELF-REPORTED: You may self-report your best test scores on your application for admission. We will use these scores when we review your file, so please make sure they are accurate and correct - entering false information, even by accident, could disqualify your application. If accepted, you will need to have the testing agency send your official scores to our office by May 1. SUBMITTED FROM THE TESTING AGENCY: Test scores can be sent through the College Board or ACT student website. Baylor's SAT code is 6032, and Baylor's ACT code is 4062. Please allow 2-3 weeks for delivery. SUBMITTED ON AN OFFICIAL HIGH SCHOOL TRANSCRIPT: We can accept test scores listed on an official high school transcript. If you plan on submitting test scores as part of your application, please be aware of the latest possible test dates we will accept based on your admission plan: Early Decision 1 and Early Action SAT – October 2 ACT – September 11 Early Decision 2 and Regular Admission SAT – December 4 ACT – December 11 4. Proof of English Language Proficiency To meet this requirement, submit one of the following items directly from the testing agency. Copies are not accepted. Official transcript (mark sheet) showing the completion of one year of full-time study at a school located in the United States Official statement of completion from one full year of full-time study at a school where English is the official language of instruction Official SAT 1 Critical Reading score of 470 (old SAT) OR new SAT reading score of 26.
