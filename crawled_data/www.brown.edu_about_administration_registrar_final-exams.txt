Final Exams Final Examination Schedule Final Exam Room Assignments by Exam Group for Spring 2022 Final Exam Room Assignments by Department for Spring 2022 Final Exam Room Assignments for Fall 2022 A period at the close of each semester is provided for final semester examinations for those courses for which such an examination is scheduled. Two examination periods are held each day. Specific information about exams such as exam group, date, time, and location (once assigned) can be found in the Final exam section for each course in [email protected]. NOTE WELL: Due to high student overlap in common multi-section exams there are occasions when an exam group for a course will need to be moved by the Office of the Registrar after the 2 week open add/drop period at the beginning of each semester from its original group. Accordingly, students should try to avoid making travel arrangements for earlier then the last day of the final exam period until after the second week of classes has ended.
