5:00 PM Columbia Global Centers | Beijing, 26, 1F Core Plaza, 1 Shanyuan Street, Zhongguancun, Haidian District, Beijing Event Brief On July 15, Columbia Global Centers | Beijing invites you to a book talk featuring Zak Dychtwald CC'12 and his recent book, Young China: How the Restless Generation Will Change Their Country and the World. Young China: How the Restless Generation Will Change Their Country and the World is a close up look on the Chinese generation born after 1990, exploring through personal encounters on how young Chinese people feel about everything from money and sex, to their government, the West, and China's shifting role in the world--not to mention their love affair with food, karaoke, and travel. Set primarily in the Eastern 2nd tier city of Suzhou and the budding Western metropolis of Chengdu, the book charts the touchstone issues this young generation faces. From single-child pressure, to test taking madness and buying an apartment as a prerequisite to marriage, from one-night-stands to an evolving understanding of family, Young China offers a fascinating portrait of the generation who will define what it means to be Chinese in the modern era. Young China has been featured in the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, and many other publications of note since its release in February of 2018. For a sample, you can visit Zak's feature on NPR Here & Now and CGTN The Heat. Speaker Zak Dychtwald is the author of Young China: How the Restless Generation Will Change Their Country and the World (St. Martin's Press; Feb 2018). He is also the founder of Young China Group, a consultancy and think tank focused on deepening understanding of the millennial mindset between China and the West. Zak also has spoken at conferences and summits on four different continents. Special Notice The event will be conducted in English.
