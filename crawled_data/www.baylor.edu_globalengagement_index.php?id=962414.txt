See below for several ways you can get involved. If you have any questions about various ways you can get involved with the ISSS office, please email Brandon Hoye, International Programs Coordinator, at Brandon_Hoye@baylor.edu. Baylor Faculty/Staff and Local Community Members Global Bears Week Baylor's orientation for international students provides an amazing opportunity to welcome incoming members of the Baylor family to campus. Each fall, hundreds of new international students arrive on campus and ISSS office relies on members of the community to help make their welcome as seamless as possible. As a volunteer during Global Bears Week, you can expect to do the following: · Help students move their luggage into their new living space on campus · Go on grocery store runs with the students to help them get the needed items for their new home · Help ISSS staff as needed in order to help the first day of Global Bears Week go smoothly Expect the time commitment for this event to be for about 3 hours on Monday, August 16th, 2021. Complete the Fall 2021 GBW volunteer form HERE. Global Friendship Program The Global Friendship Program (formerly known as the PAWS Program) is a longstanding tradition at Baylor. Local families have been connecting and building lasting relationships with current Baylor families for many years. We hear stories from both international students and their student friends and families that participating in the GFP has been a rewarding experience. As a GFP volunteer you can expect to do the following: · Must have intention to remain in program for at least one semester once matched · Be open and willing to engage in new experiences, and to share your culture and values To view more information about the Global Friendship Program click HERE. As a GFP partner, a unique way to serve students at Baylor is to make care packages for the students. Care packages go a long way in helping international students and scholars feel a sense of belonging. Care packages also evoke feelings of love and care away from home. A list of items that would be beneficial for international students and scholars in this care package include: Stationery (pencils, pens, erasers), canned foods, sweets (candy, biscuits, snacks), note of encouragement, mugs, toiletries, hand sanitizers and many others. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Current Baylor Students Global Bears Week Baylor's orientation for international students provides an amazing opportunity to welcome new incoming members of the Baylor family to campus.
