Our faculty artists are nationally and internationally recognized, and are also intensely engaged in teaching. We continually produce successful artists. We also hear from Visual Art alumni about the myriad ways in which lessons from our courses translate into a vast array of other creative enterprises. Our alumni fondly remember the many studio hours they spent in the List Art Building and note their development of critical thinking skills, technical proficiencies, and appreciation for both contemporary and historical art.
