This is particularly true with relatively small-size equipment because such equipment often is more expensive than is affordable on a research grant, but less expensive than those that can be funded through extramural equipment grant programs. The Small Equipment Grant Program is designed to strengthen research capacity and capability at Syracuse University. Up to $600,000 per year will be awarded through this mechanism as made possible by the Invest Syracuse Initiative. This document provides guidelines for the Small Equipment Grant Program.
