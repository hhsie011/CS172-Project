Unlike traditional disciplines in engineering and the mathematical sciences, the fields address the role of the human decision-maker as key contributor to the inherent complexity of systems and primary benefactor of the analyses. ISyE Fields of Specialization Interdisciplinary Research Centers ISyE Centers and Labs ISyE Postdoctoral Fellowship Program Georgia Tech pursues leading-edge research with industry, government, and community partners. At ISyE, we are a national leader in 10 core fields of specialization: Advanced Manufacturing, Analytics and Machine Learning, Applied Probability and Simulation, Data Science and Statistics, Economic Decision Analysis, Energy and Sustainable Systems, Health and Humanitarian Systems, Optimization, Supply Chain Engineering, and Systems Informatics and Control. Faculty/Staff Ph.D. Students Visitors Send A Thank You ISyE's faculty and staff members strive to provide a world-class educational experience for the Stewart School's undergraduate and graduate students, and to forge long-lasting relationships with ISyE alumni and industry partners. If you have benefited from a connection with an ISyE faculty or staff member, feel free to take a moment to send a thank-you note to that person via this web form. News Events Publications You can stay in touch with all things ISyE through our news feed, by reading one of our publications, or attending one of our upcoming events. ISyE employs some of the world’s most experienced researchers in their fields who enjoy sharing their perspectives on a wide variety of topics. Our faculty is world-renowned and our students are intellectually curious. Our alumni can be found around the globe in leadership positions within a wide variety of fields. Home Research ISyE Fields of Specialization Health and Humanitarian Systems Other Research Areas Advanced Manufacturing Analytics and Machine Learning Applied Probability and Simulation Data Science and Statistics Economic Decision Analysis Energy and Sustainable Systems Health and Humanitarian Systems Optimization Supply Chain Engineering System Informatics and Control Health and Humanitarian Systems Eva Lee, in conjunction with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, designed a real-time intraoperative planning system that improves the survival rate of patients with prostate cancer, and reduces costs to the healthcare system. This figure shows the improved 3-D seed location inside the prostate as determined by the operations-based treatment planning systems they developed. Faculty and students at ISyE are developing, applying, and disseminating advanced science and evidence-based approaches to improving health care systems and patient care, prevention of disease, public health decisions, and humanitarian systems within the U.S. and abroad through a variety of research activities. Our long-standing strengths across methodological areas are integrated with extensive knowledge of the domain and strong private and public partnerships to transform health and humanitarian systems, leading to new methods and analytical approaches, and positively affecting individual patients, population health, and health systems; as well as humanitarian systems (from disasters to development). The availability of data has risen exponentially. This data lays the foundation for improvements across health and humanitarian systems, including decisions at a variety of different levels. Research in health and humanitarian systems relates closely with many areas across ISyE, including methodology areas (e.g., simulation, optimization, and statistics) and application areas (e.g., supply chain engineering, analytics, and machine learning). Current research areas include Developing patient-centered solutions: Decision support tools for catch-up vaccination scheduling for children and adults or optimizing radiation treatment for tumors. Informing clinician decisions: Clinician guidance on which patients are at greater risk for nonconvulsive epileptic seizures using statistical techniques. Optimizing health care operations: Improving patient flow in clinic or hospitals, scheduling of medical residents, staffing decisions for nurse call centers, planning for disaster response in public health. Designing health networks: Optimizing sites for telemedicine to improve health care access or balance cost and equity over the system. Evaluating or informing policies: Evaluating the impact of school closures during an influenza pandemic, identifying areas with highest levels of childhood obesity, quantifying status quo of utilization and pathways of services, interventions to treat or prevent disease, analysis of expenditures.
