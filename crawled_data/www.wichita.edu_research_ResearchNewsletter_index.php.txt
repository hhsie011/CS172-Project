The voices, knowledge, and experiences of those who have been impacted by enduring racial inequities should be at the center of these proposals, including in, for example: project leadership and research positions, conceptualization of the proposal, decision-making processes, and the interpretation and dissemination of evidence and research results. The proposed work should provide positive outcomes for the individuals and communities engaged and should recognize peoples’ humanity, experiences, and resilience. Proposals need to consider systemic barriers to opportunities and benefits, and how these barriers impact access to, retention in, and success in STEM education, research, and workforce development. Competitive proposals will be clear with respect to how the work advances racial equity and addresses systemic racism, as these constructs may have different meanings in different settings.” Amount: Standard NSF Grant Funding Agency: U.S. Department of Energy: National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Title: Stewardship Science Academic Alliances Application Deadline: Letter of Intent due July 16, 2021 Purpose: “The Defense Programs’ Office of Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation within the Department of Energy’s (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), directs research and development activities to maintain the safety, security, and effectiveness of the nation’s nuclear weapons stockpile. This nuclear deterrent remains a vital part of our national security infrastructure. It maintains strategic stability, deters potential adversaries, and reassures our allies and partners of our security commitments. Since 1992, the United States has observed the moratorium on underground nuclear testing while significantly decreasing the size of its nuclear arsenal. National Policy required NNSA and its weapons laboratories to institute the science-based Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP) to ensure the safety, security, and effectiveness of the stockpile, while allowing the country to pursue a variety of nonproliferation and disarmament goals. The SSP combines sophisticated experiments, highly accurate physics modeling, and improved computational power to simulate and predict nuclear weapon performance over a wide range of conditions and scenarios. The Stewardship Science Academic Alliances (SSAA) Program was established in 2002 to support state-of-the-art research at U.S. academic institutions in areas of fundamental physical science and technology of relevance to the SSP mission. The SSAA Program provides the research experience necessary to maintain a cadre of trained scientists and engineers at U.S. universities to meet the nation’s current and future SSP needs, with a focus on those areas not supported by other federal agencies. It supports the DOE/NNSA’s priorities both to address the workforce specific needs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and to support the next generation of professionals who will meet those needs.” Amount: $50,000-$300,000 per year Funding Agency: National Institutes of Health Title: Data Generation Projects for the NIH Bridge to Artificial Intelligence (Bridge2AI) Program (OT2) Other Transaction Opportunity Announcement Application Deadline: Letter of Intent required by July 20, 2021; Full Applications will be due August 20, 2021 Purpose: “This Research Opportunity Announcement (ROA) invites proposals to the NIH Bridge to Artificial Intelligence (Bridge2AI) Program, soliciting Data Generation Projects to create flagship datasets based on ethical principles, associated standards and tools, and skills and workforce development to address biomedical and behavioral research grand challenges that require artificial intelligence and machine-learning (AI/ML) analysis.” Amount: The planned budget for this effort is approximately $96 million over a 4-year period.

Funding Agency: William T. Grant Foundation Title: Research Grants on Improving the Use of Research Evidence Application Deadline: Letter of Intent due August 4, 2021 Purpose: “Over the past decade, a growing body of research has illuminated the conditions that facilitate the use of research evidence in policy and practice. For example, studies find that when research is relevant to decision makers, deliberated over thoughtfully, and embedded in policymaking processes, routines, and tools, the findings are more likely to be used. Still, there remain many unanswered questions that are critical to understanding how to improve the production and use of research evidence. What’s more, there is a scarcity of evidence supporting the notion that research use in policy and practice will necessarily improve youth outcomes. Serious scientific inquiry is needed. We need to know the conditions under which using research evidence improves decision making, policy implementation, service delivery, and, ultimately, youth outcomes. In short, we need research on the use of research.” Amount: $100,000-$1,000,000 Funding Agency: William T. Grant Foundation Title: Research Grants on Reducing Inequality Application Deadline: Letter of Intent due August 4, 2021 Purpose: “Our focus on reducing inequality grew out of our view that research can do more than help us understand the problem of inequality—it can generate effective responses. We believe that it is time to build stronger bodies of knowledge on how to reduce inequality in the United States and to move beyond the mounting research evidence about the scope, causes, and consequences of inequality. Toward this end, we seek studies that aim to build, test, or increase understanding of programs, policies, or practices to reduce inequality in the academic, social, behavioral, or economic outcomes of young people. We prioritize studies about reducing inequality on the basis of race, ethnicity, economic standing, language minority status, or immigrant origins.” Amount: $100,000-$600,000 Funding Agency: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Title: Trash Free Waters – Preventing More, Picking Up Less Application Deadline: August 6, 2021 Purpose: “This Request for Applications (RFA) solicits applications from eligible entities for grants and/or cooperative agreements to be awarded.

Stankovic: Towards Ambient Intelligence in Smart Healthcare: September 30, 2021 Talk Abstract: Is the Internet of Healthcare Things (IOHT) hype or on the cusp of a healthcare revolution? We believe that wearables, in-situ sensors, machine learning, natural language processing, and the Internet are providing the technological backbone to achieve a true revolution in healthcare. Many challenges remain due to numerous factors including the complexities of human health and the realism of deployment of the technology especially for the elderly. This talk describes our progress towards establishing an ambient intelligence for healthcare. Descriptions of several wearables and conversational-based solutions that support taking medications, exercising, and quality of handwashing will be presented. Voice will be a major modality for this coming revolution. We present a solution for detecting emotion via speech even at significant distances from a microphone and in realistic settings. We also present a novel bi-directional LSTM with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) for detecting anxiety from speech. We conclude with several observations concerning multi-disciplinary research that requires in-home deployments.

This virtual event will be held on Thursday, November 18, 2021 at 11:00 AM Eastern. This presentation will address emerging opportunities for nanotechnology to meet a growing need for safer and more affordable decentralized water treatment and reuse. Through control over material size, morphology and chemical structure, nanotechnology offers novel materials that are nearly “all surface” and hence can be more reactive per atom than bulk materials. The vision is that these enabling technologies will be leveraged to develop compact modular water treatment systems that are easy to deploy and can treat challenging waters to protect human lives and support economic development.

For the purposes of this FOA, the term “complex” can refer to a multifactorial contribution to risk (e.g., polygenic and/or environmental) and/or highly distributed functional features of the brain disorder. Studies may be either hypothesis-generating (unbiased discovery) or hypothesis-testing in design and may utilize in vivo, in situ or in vitro experimental paradigms, e.g., model organisms or human cell-based assays. While behavioral paradigms and outcome measures can be incorporated into the research design to facilitate the characterization of intracellular, transcellular and circuit mechanisms, these are neither required nor expected. Studies should not attempt to “model” disorders but instead should aim to elucidate the neurobiological impact of individual or combined risk factor(s), such as the affected molecular and cellular components and their relationships within defined biological process(es). This can include the fundamental biology of these factors, components and processes. The resulting paradigms, component pathways and biological processes should be disseminated with sufficient detail to enrich common and/or federated data resources (e.g., those contributing to the Gene Ontology, Synaptic Gene Ontology, FAIR Data Informatics) in order to bridge the gap between disease risk factors, biological mechanism and therapeutic target identification.” Amount: The combined budget for direct costs for the two-year project period may not exceed $275,000.
