The Incubator was a co-working space at the New Museum’s NEW INC. in Lower Manhattan from 2015 through 2019, at which time it transitioned to the GSAPP Incubator Prize in order to help the development of innovative alumni-led projects by offering direct financial support to selected recipients. In this form, the Prize advances domestic and international alumni projects dedicated to critical modes of practice that engage the challenges and opportunities facing the built environment today. The Prize encourages a wide range of experiments initiated by Columbia GSAPP graduates while focusing on a specific topic of inquiry each year. In 2019, the School awarded six alumni prizes of $10,000 each to advance projects dedicated to Climate Change at the Building Scale, spanning a range of creative approaches to tackling environmental urgencies through architecture and urban thinking, design, and practice—from material explorations to novel agricultural systems to resilient coastlines. In 2020, the Prize was dedicated to the topic of Climate, Health, and Cities, and the School awarded sixteen alumni prizes of $10,000 each to support projects that engage these pressing issues through a range of approaches spanning critical discourse, research, and active practice in architecture and its related fields. In 2021, ten Prizes of $10,000 will be dedicated to supporting new forms of anti-racist professional practice by funding alumni-led initiatives that critically redefine community engagement and participation. As a platform for entrepreneurship and expanded modes of practice, the Prize supports projects that bridge critical discourse and active practice and engagement.
