Are you interested in working with multi-disciplinary teams on tackling creative challenges? The Design and Innovation Management program provides undergraduate students with an understanding of how to creatively lead the management and development of solutions and systems for 21st century design and business challenges. Our design and innovation management degree focuses on the intersection of design and business, bringing together analytic and creative problem-solving skills through a human-centered design lens. Students study and apply tools and organizing frameworks from multiple disciplines including design thinking, project management, marketing principles, ethics, sustainability and social responsibility. Management of design and innovation entails working with creative teams and stakeholders to build and transform customer and user experiences within any size company or organization. This collaborative process starts with the identification and understanding of important systems, service and product challenges that affect businesses and organizations. Managers then organize, direct and apply processes that create and develop improvements to these challenges or create completely new products, services and business models. Graduates work in a variety of sectors including: design consultancies, user-experience and social-innovation analysis, nonprofits, startup companies, educational institutions, government research agencies, entrepreneurship in green industry and social ventures, and graduate studies in design, social sciences, engineering, management. Design and innovation management is a major offered in Corvallis. Options: Once you enroll in the design and innovation management program, you can select an area of focus from the following options: Dean's Academy The Dean’s Academy is an academic forum for high-achieving first-year students, transfer students, and current undergraduate students who wish to maximize the educational and experiential aspects of their college experience.
