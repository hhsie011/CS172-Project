Infectious Disease May 19 2022 Columbia University Honors School's Pandemic Leadership On May 19, Columbia University President Lee Bollinger awarded the Nicholas Murray Butler Gold Medal to 21 members of the President’s Advisory Task Force on COVID-19. The group, whose members include Dean Linda P. Fried and Wafaa El-Sadr, is charged with ensuring the health and safety of the University community, maintaining financial stability in unprecedented times, and providing facilities equipped to manage the threat of the COVID-19 virus. The Butler Medal was established in 1914 to honor Columbians who have made distinguished contributions in academic administration or in furtherance of the work of the University. Several Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) faculty were also honored as members of the Task Force. They include Donna Lynne, DrPH '03, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of CUIMC and adjunct assistant professor of Health Policy and Management; Melanie Bernitz, Senior Vice President for Columbia Health; and posthumously, Scott Hammer, who served as chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases. In presenting the honor, President Bollinger said: “The group’s guiding principle was to maintain the mission of the University while preserving the health of our community. These colleagues worked and continue to work tirelessly with humility and steadfast commitment in support of Columbia’s faculty, staff, and students. With genuine gratitude for the extraordinary ways in which the President’s Advisory Task Force on COVID-19 served the University community throughout this unprecedented period in our history, we present each of them with the Butler Medal.” Related Stories Our Experts Help Explain the Monkeypox Outbreak Survey Finds High Rates of Depression Among Latin American Health Care Providers BARDA Support to Speed Development of Next-Generation Sequencing-Based Diagnostics Platform Related Faculty Linda Fried Dean of the Mailman School of Public Health and DeLamar Professor of Public Health Practice, Professor Epidemiology and Medicine Wafaa El-Sadr University Professor, Dr. Mathilde Krim-amfAR Chair of Global Health Epidemiology (In ICAP) More in Infectious Disease Our Experts Help Explain the Monkeypox Outbreak Survey Finds High Rates of Depression Among Latin American Health Care Providers BARDA Support to Speed Development of Next-Generation Sequencing-Based Diagnostics Platform Columnbia Mailman Connect with Us Public Health Now News Events Publications Topics Student Voices Academics Departments Degrees Course Directory Calendar Policy & Procedures Office of Education Research Featured Research Global Health Centers Programs Grants & Awards Corporate Partnerships People Our Faculty Current Students Friends and Supporters Partners Alumni Become a Student Meet Our Faculty Life & Community Degree Finder How to Apply Career Services More Information Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health | 722 West 168th St. NY, NY 10032 Site Map Privacy Columbia University Irving Medical Center Copyright © Columbia University 2019 Information For Current Students Faculty & Staff Alumni Employers
