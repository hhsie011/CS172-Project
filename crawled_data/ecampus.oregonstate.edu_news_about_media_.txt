Our beginnings Oregon State University’s roots in distance education stretch back to the 1880s when the university delivered “farmers’ institutes” in rural communities throughout the state. Oregon State’s first complete distance degree program was offered in liberal studies via correspondence and video in 1982, and OSU Ecampus – as the unit exists today – began delivering degree programs and courses online in 2002. Learn more about our history in our interactive timeline. Our students Ecampus proudly serves adult learners in all 50 states and more than 60 countries. The people who enroll in Ecampus courses and programs consist of distance (off-campus) students – whose life situations make it difficult for them to attend courses on Oregon State’s Corvallis or Bend campuses – and campus-based students who may take an occasional online course due to a schedule conflict or preference for online learning. Here is a student demographic breakdown for the 2020-21 school year: Approximately 24% of OSU distance students live in Oregon. The average age of OSU distance students is 31. OSU students enrolled in 406,505 credit hours online, a 20% increase from the previous year. Distance students took 54% (218,003) of all Ecampus credit hours.
