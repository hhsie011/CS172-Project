Software Engineers "The upperclassmen in DALI have provided invaluable mentorship, from teaching the actual technologies to giving career tips and linking me to previous employers." — Annie Ke D‘19 digital designers “I love the creative freedom we are given to work on different projects with amazing individuals!” — Danny Kim D‘18 Project managers “As a PM at DALI, you run into challenges that don’t really occur in classroom settings.” — Shirley Zhang D‘19 Our Mission To elevate learning through the transformative process of building digital solutions from discovery to impact. We challenge ourselves to care — for each other, for the craft we are learning, for the problems we are solving, for the reality we live in, and for the future we envision. Our Values We step up: Meet challenges, pursue learning opportunities, choose to take initiative in big and small ways. We are tenacious: Commit to bring our best effort despite setbacks, and persevere through the bugs, the crits, and the occasional lack of snacks. We believe that difference is a strength: Challenge biased norms and be inclusive of a variety of people, perspectives, ideas, approaches, and projects. We adapt: There’s no recipe - be ready and willing to change course and iterate. We create thoughtfully: Investigate the value and consequences of what, how, and why we make. Set a high bar, technically and ethically. We invest in each other: Be generous with your time, knowledge, and emotional support. Learn from your teammates and give back through mentorship. We risk being genuine and vulnerable: Admit weakness, ask questions, be open when asking for and giving help, trust others and yourself. Code, laugh, love: Don’t take life too seriously.
