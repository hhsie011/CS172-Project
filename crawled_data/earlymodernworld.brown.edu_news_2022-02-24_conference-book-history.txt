This is a great opportunity for students to meet other peers interested in these topics at area institutions and to take advantage of the well-oiled machinery of the Harvard Book History community, in particular. If you have any additional questions, please direct them to Elizabeth_Nielsen@brown.edu (grad student, History) who is the graduate student convenor at Brown.
