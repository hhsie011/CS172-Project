However, students may contact our office and request an in-person meeting (masks required). Students can best reach us through email at [email protected] or directly at our individual email addresses. We are also available by phone at 401-863-2653. Meetings with the Director can be scheduled here. In response to the pandemic, we have worked to ensure we have processes and practices in place that reflect our values of caring for others in our community, educating students, and using restorative approaches to our work. More information about university operations, resources, and what to expect around campus can be found here. Students who have returned to campus are expected to follow required public health practices and understand that disregard of public health practices is a conduct violation that could result in removal from campus. We have put in place COVID-19 Procedures for addressing behaviors that are contrary to the policies and practices put in place to safeguard the health and safety of our community.
