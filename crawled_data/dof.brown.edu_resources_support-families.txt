Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account Flexible spending accounts allow faculty members' dependents to work, seek work or study as full-time students. Dependent Care Travel Fund Dependent Care Travel Funds support faculty attending academic conferences and/or conducting research away from campus who have dependent care responsibilities.

Learn more Parental Teaching Relief Brown University provides one semester of classroom teaching relief for faculty members who are primary caregivers for newborn children or newly adopted children. This is not considered to be a leave, and the faculty member’s responsibilities to conduct research, advise students and participate in University and departmental affairs remain unchanged. Faculty members wishing to receive teaching relief should contact their department chair and the Dean of the Faculty's office, preferably six months in advance of the requested relief, and also complete the Parental Teaching Relief online form. For more on this policy, go to The Handbook of Academic Administration (Section 7.8.3).
