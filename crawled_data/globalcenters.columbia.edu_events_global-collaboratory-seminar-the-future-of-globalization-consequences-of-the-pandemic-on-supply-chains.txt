What are the consequences of threats to the collapse of supply chains and international trading systems, particularly in food, medicine, technology, and data? What is the impact of the global crisis and the U.S.-China trade war on the future of supply chains? What does history teach us about supply chains as a physical manifestation of globalization and an interconnected world? This seminar is brought to you by Columbia Global Centers as part of the Global Columbia Collaboratory, a new initiative developed in partnership with the Center for Undergraduate Global Engagement designed to give students the skills, understanding, and networks to grow into the leaders our world needs to thoughtfully address our increasingly complex challenges.
