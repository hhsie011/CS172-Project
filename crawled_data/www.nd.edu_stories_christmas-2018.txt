Chesterton Stones, crafted by God, can be rough and misshapen. No one exactly like another. But when placed side by side, they can form a cave so strong, yet so humble. It’s fit for the birth of the Prince of Peace. In a cave alongside animals, the infant Jesus came into the world to teach us how to love God and one another. This Christmas and always may we remember to love each other in all our roughness for we are all crafted by the hand of God to be, as the scriptures say, “living stones” built into a spiritual house. Standing together, we too can be a dwelling place for Christ our Lord. Merry Christmas from Rev. John I. Jenkins, C.S.C.
