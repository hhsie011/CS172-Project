By networking, you share your story, interests, and aspirations with people who may have similar professional interests. These relationships can bring new perspectives, more connections, and opportunities that help you with your career journey. We encourage you to start networking by talking to your peers, classmates, faculty, and advisors. Reaching out to alumni and professionals in the field can also expand your network and understanding of your interests.
