The Leadership Alliance was founded by Brown University in 1992, to address the shortage of underrepresented students in competitive graduate programs and academic careers and the professoriate. The Leadership Alliance’s members include predominantly white institutions working closely with historically Black colleges and universities, minority-serving institutions, and industry partners who are committed to developing underrepresented students into outstanding leaders and role models in academia, business, and the public sector. Brown’s participation in the Leadership Alliance through its Summer Research – Early Identification Program helps guide outstanding students to Brown graduate programs. To date, more than 20 SR-EIP students have enrolled in graduate programs with the Brown departments that hosted their undergraduate research experience. Departments/institutions that are actively working with the Leadership Alliance include Alpert Medical School, Biomedical Sciences, Chemistry, Computer Science, the Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences (DEEPS), Institute at Brown for Environment and Society (IBES), the Population Studies and Training Center (PSTC) and others. We also offer opportunities in multiple Humanities and Social Sciences departments.
