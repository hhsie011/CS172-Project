Commonly known as a “central science,” chemical research has led to new discoveries in agriculture, manufacturing, medicine, technology and more. The 123-credit-hour Chemistry BA or BS degree prepares you for the path of your choice after graduation. Temple is the ideal location for a Chemistry Major—there are a large number of chemical and pharmaceutical companies based in the Philadelphia region. Many graduates pursue work in the biotechnological, chemical or pharmaceutical industries. As a Chemistry Major, you’ll study analytical chemistry, biochemistry, inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry and physical chemistry, in addition to courses in the College of Science and Technology chemistry labs. Both degrees emphasize expertise to write scientific reports, investigation and problem-solving skills, laboratory skills in four of five subdivisions of chemistry, material from foundational course work in four of five subdivisions of chemical research, research and chemical literature, and the ability to analyze data and apply results in a broader scientific context and real-life situations. Upper-level coursework provides opportunities for independent research under the guidance of program faculty, including the potential to present findings at national meetings. You’ll also have hands-on, experiential opportunities in a variety of laboratories. You can collaborate with faculty and peers on research involving innovative technology, such as smart detectors, spectroscopy and ultrafast laser chemistry. Choosing between a BA and a BS The Bachelor of Arts in Chemistry is for students who intend on pursuing careers in chemistry or a related field that is not associated with research. Students learn how to craft scientific reports, analyze the data and connect these results to a range of scientific contexts. The 53-credit-hour Chemistry BA covers the fundamentals of chemistry, mathematics and physics, and prepares graduates for advanced study in a number of fields. Alternatively, the Bachelor of Science in Chemistry prepares students for graduate or medical school, and employment in the biotechnological, chemical or pharmaceutical industries. Students learn a wide array of topics in chemistry, mathematics and physics. Chemistry BS Majors are required to take more laboratory classes during their third and fourth years in the program. The BS degree requires between 70 and 74 credit hours and is accredited by the American Chemical Society.
