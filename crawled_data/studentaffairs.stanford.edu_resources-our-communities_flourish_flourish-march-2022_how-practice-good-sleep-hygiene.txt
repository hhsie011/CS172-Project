Avoid consuming caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine - These act as stimulants and interfere with falling asleep. Avoid naps during the day - If you do need a nap, try to keep it less than an hour and before 3pm. Have an electronics curfew - Do not use electronics 60 minutes prior to bed. If this is too much, try starting with 30 minutes or 10 minutes prior to bed. Create the right space - Make your bed and bedroom quiet and comfortable for sleeping; create a quiet and dark place. Keep the bed for sleeping - Do not use your bed for anything other than sleeping and sex. Develop bedtime rituals - Try relaxing stretches or breathing exercises 15 minutes before bed; Try showering, brushing teeth, or putting on lotion. Get up and try again - If it’s been 30 minutes or more, try getting out of bed and doing something that calms and relaxes you until you feel sleepy again. Avoid watching the clock - Checking the clock during the night can wake you up and reinforce negative thoughts about not being able to sleep. Avoid catastrophic thinking - If you do not get the recommended amount of sleep, do not stress over it. Keep trying new things to help you get to bed earlier.
