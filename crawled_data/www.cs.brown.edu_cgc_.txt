Center for Geometric Computing Objective The objective of the center is a long-range coordinated effort, carried out at Brown, Duke, and Johns Hopkins, aimed at facilitating an effective technology transfer from Computational Geometry to relevant applied fields. The center has received major support from the Army Research Office from 1995 to 2001. Accomplishments of the center include: A methodology for robustness, based on the exact evaluation of geometric predicates, efficient adaptive-precision filters, and certificates for geometric constructors. Practical algorithms with low arithmetic demands. A methodology for I/O-scalable geometric algorithms. Prototypical high-quality software, as a seed for a geometric library.
