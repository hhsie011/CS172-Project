Established in 1898, the School is now among the largest civil and environmental engineering programs in the country. Students on the civil track train to tackle projects like roads and bridges, sure, but they also work on technologies for green buildings, strategies that help us recover from disasters, and projects to alleviate poverty. Environmental engineers may focus on issues like clean drinking water, air-quality monitoring and pollution controls.
