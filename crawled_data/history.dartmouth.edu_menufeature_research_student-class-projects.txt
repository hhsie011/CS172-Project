Winter 2022 | Professor Winston HIST 87/LACS 76: Culture and Identity in Modern Mexico Explore the collection of digital exhibits created by the students in Culture and Identity in Modern Mexico with Professor Bryan Winston. Visit the exhibition here. Fall 2021 | Professor Barlow Robles Digital Exhibition: The Kitchen in the Cabinet kitchen_in_the_cabinet.jpg The Kitchen in the Cabinet interactive homepage, designed by Australian graphic designer Katie Dean. In Fall 2021, Whitney Barlow Robles, a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of History and Society of Fellows, launched a digital exhibition titled The Kitchen in the Cabinet: Histories of Food and Science. The exhibition is the product of a collaboration among Robles, Australian graphic designer Katie Dean, and three Dartmouth undergraduate students—Fatema Begum, Lauren Dorsey, and C.C. Lucas. The Kitchen in the Cabinet investigates the intimate ties among food, natural science, imperialism, and slavery in the early modern period through the stories of centuries-old food artifacts. Despite their perishable nature, these objects survived to the present by being preserved in scientific collections such as natural history museums. During the pandemic, the team set out on armchair expeditions, virtually mining the websites of museums from across the globe and reaching out to curators in pursuit of food artifacts that had survived against the odds. Some of the items they found include a specimen of breadfruit, intended to cheaply provision enslaved individuals in the eighteenth-century Caribbean; a block of dehydrated "portable soup," the likes of which fed sailors and helped stave off scurvy on circumnavigations of the globe; and burnt fragments of persimmon seeds from George Washington's Mount Vernon estate, one of the few foods on the plantation to be eaten by both the enslavers and the enslaved. The website is best explored from a laptop or desktop computer, which allows users to engage with an interactive homepage designed by Dean and coded by Dorsey. When visitors arrive at the site, they are greeted with a scene based on an etching and engraving from Denis Diderot and Jean-Baptiste le Rond d'Alembert's famed Encyclopédie, a major contribution to Enlightenment print culture that, in the process of striving to catalogue all human knowledge, visualized the worlds of craftspeople. Dean populated the print with the exhibition's featured objects, drawing attention to their latent food and craft nature. By hovering their cursor over individual objects, visitors can read short synopses and click through to each object's full story. The image on each individual artifact's page has a rollover function, likewise activated by one's cursor, that draws attention to the instability of the object's categorization as a scientific specimen rather than a food object. While the exhibition targets specialists in food studies and the history of science, it also engages a number of contemporary issues, ranging from the continued exploitation and cruel labor conditions in today's food industry—as described, for example, in Begum's feature on Ernest Hemingway's tuna specimen—to the effects of climate change on archives of food, as probed by Dorsey in her feature on a bottle of horseradish preserved by Antarctica's snow and ice. Fall 2021 | Professor Meléndez-Badillo HIST 5.13/LACS 1.10: Modern Latin America & HIST 82.04/LACS 46.6: Transnational Utopias: Latin American Anarchisms 21f-class-projects.jpg Students in HIST 5.13/LACS 1.10 produced a podcast. Students in HIST 82.04/LACS 46.60 created a virtual social study center. Explore the digital humanities class projects from students in Professor Meléndez-Badillo's courses in Fall 2021. Students in Modern Latin America produced a podcast, Ediciones del Norte Frío, and students in Transnational Utopias: Latin American Anarchisms created a virtual social study center. Read Professor Meléndez-Badillo's description of the class projects below: The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted our lives in multiple ways. Teaching online during the lockdown forced me to reconceptualize my pedagogies. It gave me a space to experiment with digital humanities in ways I had not done so in the past. Each class had at least one digital humanities assignment, from a Twitter account to interactive maps and timelines. These exercises allowed students to work collaboratively and to challenge their preconceived notions of what constitutes legitimate forms of knowledge production. The success of these assignments in garnering student interest convinced me to continue experimenting with digital humanities when we went back to the classroom. In my Modern Latin America course, which took place in Fall '21, students collectively created a podcast titled "Ediciones del Norte Frío." The name was a tribute to a publishing house that operated out of Hanover, NH, and published key texts in the world of Latin American letters in the 1980s and 1990s. The podcast was the culmination of students' collaborative work throughout the term. Influenced by pandemic life, I divided the 35-student class into seven pods during the course's first week. This structure guided the assignments and classroom discussions. I would often pose a few questions for students to discuss in their pods, later coming together and sharing impressions. By the second half of the term, students commented that they felt a sense of community in each one of the pods. The assignments were also structured in a way that allowed students to build on the topic they would research in their final project. Towards the end of the term, each pod brainstormed ways that their individual topics intersected to give each podcast episode cohesion. Ultimately, students created a podcast in which they researched, wrote, and produced all the episodes. In the Transnational Utopias: Latin American Anarchisms class, students created a sense of community organically. This was facilitated by the class size; 11 students. Throughout the term, students engaged with the ways that anarchists, workers, and intellectuals built global networks of information and alternative pedagogical projects. One of the projects that we paid particular attention to in class were "Social Study Centers." While we originally wanted to occupy a space on campus to build a physical infrastructure for the class' final project, we decided on creating a virtual center. The website served two different roles in terms of class assignments. Students conducted research and produced a final paper but instead of using the traditional format, each one of them produced a 'zine. Short for magazines, zines are an important element in countercultural knowledge production. They are also part of an abolitionist pedagogy. While the zines were the virtual center's core, we also divided the class into smaller pods that generated additional educational content for the website. The final product included an interactive map, media gallery, resources, and micro-syllabi. These assignments allowed students' learning experience beyond the classroom while fostering a sense of community and experimenting with different forms of knowledge production. Fall 2020 | Professor Ericson HIST 5.05: The Emergence of Modern Japan emergence_of_modern_japan.jpg History 5.05, The Emergence of Modern Japan, taught by Professor Steven Ericson, is a survey of Japanese history from the mid-nineteenth century to the present. Topics include the building of a modern state and the growth of political opposition, industrialization and its social consequences, the rise and fall of the Japanese colonial empire, and the postwar economic 'miracle.' In Fall 2020, several students created digital media projects from their research.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of History Undergraduate Overview History FAQs for First Year and Transfer Students How to Declare a Major or Minor in History Major Modified Major Minor Transfer Credit Policy Course Descriptions First-Year Seminars Introductory Africa, Asia, Latin America & The Caribbean (AALAC) Europe (EUR) Interregional & Comparative (INTER) United States (US) Seminars & Colloquia Independent Study & Honors Course Schedule 2021-2022 Schedule 2022-2023 Schedule 2023-2024 Schedule Course Syllabi Honors Thesis Program General Timeline Guidelines for the Class of 2022 Guidelines for the Class of 2023 Honors Theses By Year Phi Alpha Theta Honors Society Prizes After Graduation Alumni Update Research Overview Faculty Research Initiatives Dartmouth History Institute Student Research Initiatives and Resources The Dartmouth Vietnam Project History Librarian Research Funding Resources Undergraduate Research Database Student Class Projects Foreign Study News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
