In addition to the new look, individual sections of the audit can be collapsed and expanded at will. The requirement status symbols have also changed, but they still use the familiar red/blue/green color coding. Like the previous version, these circles will display immediately to the left of each requirement. Additionally, the audit will indicate whether a course is a repeat. Please note that all repeats are notated with “(R)” despite their official transcript indicator. For more details about different types of repeated courses please visit the Official Transcript Details website. Process & Progress Circle Process New is now just Process, and the progress bar has been replaced with a progress circle: Class History & GPA Estimators The Class History and GPA Estimators have moved to the top right corner of the audit: What-If & Look Ahead (Future Classes) The What-If and Look Ahead (now called Future Classes) tools have been combined. They can be used together or independently.
