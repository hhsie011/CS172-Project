Lecturer Office: Daniel 416 Phone: Email: wcratli@clemson.edu Educational Background M.A. Communication University of Dayton 2021 B.S. Communication, Technology, and Culture Bridgewater College 2019 Courses Taught Communication 2500 - Clemson University Communication 100 - University of Dayton Profile Will Ratliff earned his M.A. in Communication from the University of Dayton (Ohio), having served as a graduate teaching assistant in the basic communication course from 2019-2021, as well as serving as the assistant to the basic course director during the 2020-2021 academic year. Over the course of that time, he became convinced of the importance of instructional communication as a field of study, as well as the value of the basic course in the university setting. As such, Will's research interests rest largely in the instructional communication realm, having conducted multiple studies on the topic of student engagement and instructional success. Most recently, he studied student perceptions of instructional communication strategies during the early portion of the COVID-19 pandemic. Will is a native of the Appalachian mountains of Virginia, loves spending time with his family, delights in the outdoors, and can often be found enjoying the trails around Clemson's campus.
