A minor in Chemistry offers students the opportunity to explore a number of the diverse areas in this "central" science. For some students who have fulfilled chemistry pre-med requirements, the minor can be fulfilled by taking just two additional courses; however, in accordance with A&S policy, a student must have at least 15 credits in the minor program that are not used to fulfill requirements for another major or minor. The minor in Chemistry in the College of Arts and Sciences consists of six courses: 2 General Chemistry or the equivalent (CHEM1109-1110 or CHEM1117-1118, with associated laboratories) 4 Additional 3-credit chemistry (CHEM) courses (plus 1-credit co-requisite lab courses, when necessary) that are 2000 level or above. Normally, two of the four courses would be Organic Chemistry I and II with associated laboratories, but other selections might be better choices, depending on the student’s objective in attaining the minor. The following courses for non-science majors cannot be used to complete the minor: CHEM1102 Intersection of Science and Painting, CHEM1103 Chemistry in the Marketplace I, CHEM1104 Chemistry in the Marketplace II, CHEM1105 Chemistry and Society I, CHEM1106 Chemistry and Society II, or CHEM1161 Life Science Chemistry. The following research courses cannot be used to complete the minor: CHEM4491-4492 Introduction to Undergraduate Research I and II, CHEM5591-5592 Undergraduate Chemical Research I and II or CHEM5593-5594 Undergraduate Biochemical Research I and II. Courses are to be chosen in consultation with a faculty advisor and approved by the Director, Professor Lynne O’Connell (Merkert 111, ext. 2-3626, oconnell@bc.edu) Updated 10.2.14 Back To Top Back To Top Chemistry Department Merkert Center 617-552-3605 Twitter Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences Gasson Hall 140 Commonwealth Avenue Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 About Undergraduate Graduate Faculty & Research Departments Contact Departments Art, Art History, and Film Biology Chemistry Classical Studies Communication Computer Science Earth and Environmental Sciences Economics Engineering English German Studies History Mathematics Music Philosophy Physics Political Science Psychology Romance Languages and Literatures Slavic & Eastern Languages and Literatures Sociology Theatre Theology Giving to Chemistry Apply Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Accessibility Emergency Contact Notice of Nondiscrimination Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Boston College
