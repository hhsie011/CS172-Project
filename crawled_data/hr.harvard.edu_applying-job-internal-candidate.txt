You’ve taken classes, brushed up your resume, networked, and identified a position you’re interested in. It’s time to take the next active step in your career. Before You Apply As you get ready to apply and get into the applicant pool for your next career step, do a quick review by asking yourself these questions: Have I been in my current position long enough to cultivate good relationships and prove my abilities? Hiring managers look for a stable work history. They prefer candidates who have been in their positions for at least 6 months to a year. How strong is my performance in my current job? If your current rating is not strong, think about ways to improve it first. Cultivate a reputation for getting things done while maintaining good relationships. What are my skills, strengths, and passions? Be realistic about your strengths, professional passions, and preferences. They’ll help you recognize potential fit in a job opening. Do I have high-quality, up to date application materials? Have a well-written, relevant resumé and cover letter, and a prepared list of references. Make sure your LinkedIn page is up to date. Am I ready for an interview? You’ll need to be prepared, rehearsed, and appropriately dressed for every interview. Learn as much as you can about the department and the job ahead of time, so you can be specific and enthusiastic about the position.
