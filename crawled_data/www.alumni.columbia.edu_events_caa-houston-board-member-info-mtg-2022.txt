Mtg 2022 Share Add to Calendar: Calendar / Outlook Google Yahoo March 5, 2022 America/Chicago Off-campus This gathering will be an informational session about our club and how you can get involved. We're a lively bunch and we're looking to add more people to the fun by inviting you to join us at Holman Brew Hall on February 10. We'll spend the time getting to know each other and discussing upcoming events and share a little on our open board positions. We will also use the time to plan the calendar for the rest of the year. We'd love your input! If you're interested in getting more involved and meeting new people in the city, please join us on February 10. We will send out a reminder email a few days beforehand. Before we meet, we'd like to get to know you all a bit better and see what interests you. Please fill out this survey so we can craft events that suit our alumni.
