Building, protecting, and enhancing the brand requires desire and a disciplined approach to ensure its integrity and relevance. +What is a Brand? It's a feeling. It's a perception. It's the culmination of each individual element of an organization that is experienced by someone. For Iowa State, it includes our wordmark, the sound of the Campanile bells on a spring day, our websites, the way we answer the phone, and everything in between. Each element is critical to the cumulative success of the overall university brand. +The Iowa State University Brand Our brand is built to further the mission of our inaugural land-grant university heritage and convey the student-friendly adventure we've become known for.
