If a non-Political Science course is taken to fulfill the methods requirement, it will not count as one of the outside courses - it becomes a 13th course.

Three additional 1000 level track courses from within the department Subfield breakdown Two 1000 level courses from outside the department which relate to track. Outside courses are chosen with the approval of the concentration advisor from appropriate 1000 level courses offered in other departments, such as, but not limited to: African-American Studies American Civilization Anthropology Classics Economics History International Relations Philosophy Religious Studies Sociology Your concentration advisor may approve a course from another department if it clearly meets the intent of the outside course requirement. Concentration worksheet Points to Remember Course Count Courses may count twice to fill two separate requirements provided the total number of Political Science courses is ten. Freshman Seminars Students can use one freshman seminar only as an elective. Freshman seminars do not count as track courses or as Intro courses. Senior Capstone Course The course used toward the concentration requirements must fall in the student’s subfield track. Moreover, the course must be taken at Brown DURING STUDENT’S SENIOR YEAR. Students may continue to receive credit for seminars taken abroad or at other institutions to meet other concentration requirements. Seminar Overlap A student cannot count as a senior seminar a course that overlaps significantly with the freshman seminar he/she is using as an elective.
