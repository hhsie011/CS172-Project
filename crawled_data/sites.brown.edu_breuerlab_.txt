Congratulations to Alex and Ilan on receiving the Halpin fellowship New paper on airflows in passenger cars Welcome to Cameron and Xiaowei Welcome Welcome to the Breuer Lab at Brown University! We are a lively group of researchers, active in a variety of research, loosely centered on the theme of experimental fluid mechanics, and covering topics that include: Animal flight â€“ the mechanics and dynamics of bat and bird flight Fluid structure interactions, with a special focus on the interactions of fluids with extremely compliant structures, such as membranes Vortex dynamics, particularly, the formation, growth and behavior of leading edge vortices at high Reynolds numbers Renewable energy harvesting, Innovative, bioinspired engineering Micron scale bio-fluid mechanics, including active matter and bacterial cell motility Our lab is located on the West end of Prince Laboratory on the campus of Brown University, in Providence Rhode Island.
