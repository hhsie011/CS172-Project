Your generosity makes this commitment—and the dream of a Notre Dame education—possible. When you make a gift to financial aid, you deliver the dream of a world-class Notre Dame education into reach for today's best, brightest, and most deserving students. Last year, 69 percent of undergraduate students received some form of financial aid—and gifts of $200 and less funded the full cost of tuition and fees for 47 Notre Dame students. A Notre Dame education changes lives in a way few other experiences can. Unsurpassed academic opportunities, internationally renowned faculty, a unique campus experience, and an enduring spirit of kinship—through your generosity, financial aid makes all of this possible for thousands of Domers each year.
