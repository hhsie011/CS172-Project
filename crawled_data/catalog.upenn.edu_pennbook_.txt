These policies govern academic activities such as grading and exams, provide guidance on the use of campus resources, and explain expectations for membership in the university community. The two most important policies in the Pennbook are the Code of Student Conduct and the Code of Academic Integrity. These two policies outline the general responsibilities of being a student at Penn. All students are expected to have read and understood both policies before coming to campus. If you live on campus, consult the Residential Handbook for the policies, rules, and regulations that govern living in Penn’s residential community. For policies governing faculty, please consult the Faculty Handbook. For those governing Penn employees, see the Human Resources Policy Manual.
