By tightening entrance and degree requirements, Sears tactfully phased out the aspects of Wayland’s educational reform that had weakened the caliber of the University’s education. Sears also allowed students more freedom, earning their affection at the same time. As historian Walter Bronson summarized: “He was not a son of thunder, like President Wayland; but in sunshine as well as in thunder there is power.” Brown University Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA Phone: 401-863-1000 Maps & Directions / Contact Us © Brown University X
