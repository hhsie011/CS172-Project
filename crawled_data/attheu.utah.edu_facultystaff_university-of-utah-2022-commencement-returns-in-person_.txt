The University of Utah @theU University of Utah 2022 Commencement returns—in person Rebecca Walsh University of Utah Communications April 27, 2022 The University of Utah’s celebration of the Class of 2022 will take place in person after two years of virtual pomp and circumstance necessitated by the coronavirus pandemic. The 153rd general commencement will be held at 6 p.m. on Thursday, May 5 at the Jon M. Huntsman Center. In-person college convocations also will resume in the Alumni House, Huntsman Center, Kingsbury Hall and Union Building on May 5 and 6. Schools of Dentistry and Medicine and the colleges of Law and Pharmacy will hold their ceremonies later in the month. Three years of college for the Class of 2022 have been impacted by COVID-19—including remote and online classes, changing masking policies and the development, and requirement, of vaccines. Still, this year’s graduates have persevered, said Taylor Randall, president. “We want to recognize the incredible circumstances this class of students took head on,” Randall said. “These graduates have shown amazing grace and resilience, pushing through and succeeding in spite of historic challenges and uncertainty. It’s time to celebrate their achievements!” The U will celebrate 8,609 graduates, including student speaker Samuel Aguilar, a “Dreamer” under DACA. The first in his family to attend college, Aguilar enrolled at the U as a traditional high school graduate, but had to drop out in 2013 when he couldn’t afford his tuition. He returned six years later to complete a double bachelor’s degree in kinesiology and writing and rhetoric studies. For the past nine years, Aguilar has worked at ARUP Laboratories in client services, working his way up to becoming a supervisor, co-managing a group of 150-plus employees. He says the challenges he has overcome are representative of the graduating class. “The last three years being back were not easy. I know we struggled through the pandemic and adapting to the new normal,” Aguilar said in his speech. “But we made it, and that is something to be proud of.” Read more student stories from the Class of 2022 here. Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser, an alum from the Class of 1984, will deliver the keynote speech. “I can’t wait to celebrate our graduates in person after two years of virtual commencements,” said Lori McDonald, vice president for student affairs. “Many of these students had their college experience interrupted by the pandemic more than once. I’m so glad we’re able to honor that strength and perseverance with an exceptionally exciting commencement ceremony.” About the graduating class (These numbers are based on data available prior to graduation and are subject to change.)
