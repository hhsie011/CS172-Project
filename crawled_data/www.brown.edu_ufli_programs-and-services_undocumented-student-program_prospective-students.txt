Please consult with Admission and the Financial Aid Office (please see the bottom section of this link for more information). Prospective Graduate Students Please visit the Graduate School sites for more information. Prospective undocumented and DACA students may also contact [email protected] and ask to be connected to a Graduate School Dean. Prospective Medical Students Students with DACA are welcome to apply to the Warren Alpert Medical School through the regular admission process. Unfortunately, due to eligibility requirements that are part of medical school, we are unable to accept applications from students who are undocumented. If you have additional questions, please contact Joanne McEvoy, Director of Admissions.
