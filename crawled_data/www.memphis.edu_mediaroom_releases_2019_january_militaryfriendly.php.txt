The UofM was ranked gold status among Tier 2 research institutions. The list honors the top colleges, universities and trade schools that are doing the most to embrace military service members and veterans as students and ensure their success on campus. Among the UofM's military-friendly features are: a Veterans and Military Student Services Center which assist veterans and military service members with the transition from a military environment to a positive academic community that supports their success on campus; a wide range of online courses and degree programs; participation in the Yellow Ribbon Program; seamless transfer of credits from community colleges; and three ROTC programs – Army, Navy and Air Force. In addition, the Memphis area is home to Naval Support Activity Mid-South and its strong military community. The University recently announced that it is accepting the Folds of Honor scholarship, a $5,000 annual award, as payment in full for tuition. The Folds of Honor scholarship supports higher education for spouses and children of America's fallen and disabled service members. The UofM is the first institution of higher learning nationally to partner with Folds of Honor. The list of Military Friendly Schools is compiled through extensive research and a data-driven survey of employers, schools, franchise systems and cities nationwide.
