He explores how Islamic thinkers have asked and answered such questions as: Does religion need philosophy? How can religion coexist with rationalism? What does it mean to interpret a religious narrative philosophically? Is there such a thing as an Islamic state, or should Muslims reinvent political institutions that suit their own times? The book shows that throughout the centuries philosophizing in Islam has meant a commitment to forward and open thinking. 212-854-5573 [email protected] Genre Nonfiction Topic Religion Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
