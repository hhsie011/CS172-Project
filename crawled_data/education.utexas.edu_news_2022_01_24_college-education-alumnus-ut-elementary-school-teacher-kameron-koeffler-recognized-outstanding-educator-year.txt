Koeffler, a fifth-grade teacher at University of Texas Elementary School, is an alumnus of the College of Education at The University of Texas at Austin where he received his bachelor’s degree in applied learning and development. Koeffler first taught third-grade language arts and social studies at UT Elementary School, and was honored with a Rookie of the Year award in 2017. He currently teaches both fifth-grade language arts and social studies at the school as well as assists students with learning disabilities (LD). For his exceptional efforts, he was nominated for the award by Jessica Toste, associate professor in the Department of Special Education, and a fellow of the Reading Institute within The Meadows Center for Preventing Educational Risk. "As a trained special educator, I have seen Kameron translate his knowledge of evidence-based practices and disability into his classroom as a general education teacher. For his commitment to students with or at-risk for LD, as well as his passionate pursuit of diversity, equity and justice in education, I can think of no teacher more deserving of DLD's Outstanding Educator of the Year Award than Kameron Koeffler. He is truly the teacher that every parent dreams their child could have,” Toste remarked.
