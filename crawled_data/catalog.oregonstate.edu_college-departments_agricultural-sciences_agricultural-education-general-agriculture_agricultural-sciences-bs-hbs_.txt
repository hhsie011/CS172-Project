The Agricultural Sciences major gives you the freedom to design your own degree! As part of the degree program, you can choose from various agricultural-based credits and electives. You can go broad with exposure to all areas of agriculture, go deep within two or more emphasis areas — or do a combination of both. Our major allows you to customize your degree and take courses from different areas throughout our College of Agricultural Sciences. The agricultural sciences major allows our students to create a purposeful course plan, crossing several areas of study, to meet their individual career goals. Students use this major to prepare to return to their family operation, teach agriculture, develop agricultural communications materials, work in Extension, go into industry, sell equipment/insurance, start their own businesses, or work for state or federal agricultural programs. Major Code: 259 Demonstrate professional skills/competencies and ability to adapt to diverse audiences and diverse work environments. Demonstrate an ability to apply scientific, and computer literacy knowledge. Analyze and communicate effectively how agricultural sciences integrate with contemporary, social, economic, political, and environmental issues.
