We plan to do another sweep through campus laboratories to pick up any spare samples of the following types of face and eye protection: Face shields (medical, not welding) and glasses-like eye protection. If you have such items you would like to donate, please contact David Weindorf (david.weindorf@ttu.edu), David Dorsett (david.dorsett@ttu.edu), or Matt Roe (matt.roe@ttu.edu) and we will respond to either pick up donated materials or coordinate a time/location for drop off. We have also received an appeal from LISD regarding bags to hold meals for qualifying LISD students. If you have grocery-type bags or even lunch-sized brown bags you don't need, please let us know.
