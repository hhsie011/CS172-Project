Develop leaders. Connect your faith and work. Watch as Cheryl Gochis, Vice President & Chief Human Resources Officer, shares more about Baylor's partnership with RightNow Media. What is RightNow Media? RightNow Media is an extensive video library with access on demand from your TV, computer, tablet, or phone. It is similar to Netflix, but with a distinctive difference. RightNow is faith-based and covers issues from leadership, teams, and dealing with change, to topics such as marriage, parenting, finances, and even recovery. This free resource gives you access to over 5,000 videos from leaders such as Patrick Lencioni, Marcus Buckingham, Zig Ziglar, John Maxwell, Dave Ramsey, and Francis Chan. There is even a family section with thousands of shows and cartoons for kids to enjoy. How do I access RightNow Media? Baylor provides RightNowMedia@Work at no cost to support and enhance every faculty and staff member’s personal, professional, and spiritual wellbeing and development. As an additional benefit, you are also able to invite everyone in your household to have their own login. While this resource is completely optional, you are encouraged to register, log in, and explore all that’s available. When you receive the invitation email, you will be asked to register and to create a password. For security reasons, it is necessary to use a unique password different from your Bear ID password. Create your account. If you have any questions or do not receive the email invitation, please contact askHR (askHR@baylor.edu or x2000).
