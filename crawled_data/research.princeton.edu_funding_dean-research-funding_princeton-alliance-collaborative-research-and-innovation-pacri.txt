PACRI establishes several innovation funds at Princeton University to support research projects co-led by principal investigators from Princeton and from a PACRI partner institution. The PACRI partner institutions are Howard University, Jackson State University (JSU), Prairie View A&M University (PVAMU), Spelman College and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES). Learn more about PACRI. Faculty from all disciplines, including humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering, are encouraged to apply. Proposals should be developed jointly by a project team consisting of Princeton and partner-institution faculty members. The proposal must be submitted by the Princeton faculty member on behalf of the project team. PI Eligibility Projects must include at least one PI at Princeton University and one PI at the PACRI partner institution. All Princeton faculty and staff eligible for PI status are encouraged to apply. Dates Proposals are due by June 30, 2022 Creating Your Proposal Princeton University faculty with questions about PACRI should contact Kelly Freidenfelds in Corporate Engagement and Foundation Relations at Princeton University at kellyf@princeton.edu. Faculty from PACRI partner institutions are encouraged to reach out to their campus liaison: Howard University Pamela Clarke pamela.a.clarke@howard.edu Jackson State University Almesha Campbell almesha.l.campbell@jsums.edu Prairie View A&M University Ramaswamy Krishnamoorthi rakrishnamoorthi@pvamu.edu Spelman College Tasha Inniss tinniss@spelman.edu University of Maryland Eastern Shore LaKeisha Harris llharris@umes.edu Funding Projects will receive funding from Princeton University for two years, up to a maximum of $250,000 per project. The project start date will be September 1, 2022. Allowable Expenses Allowable expenses include support for research assistants, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, faculty research visits, and equipment, materials and supplies directly connected to the research project. Budgets should include travel expenses for the PACRI partner institution’s PI and/or research team to attend an annual PACRI program meeting, expected to be held on the Princeton campus in 2023 and a TBD location in 2024. Princeton’s core research facilities and library resources may be used for projects, and these fees should be included in project budgets. Capital expenses, tuition, indirect costs and salary for Princeton faculty are not allowed. Equipment purchases and salary for the PACRI partner institution and other collaborating faculty will be reviewed for each project. Proposal Preparation Instructions Applications should be brief, no more than three pages, plus a budget spreadsheet and a c.v. for each PI. The budget should be submitted in the budget template, which can be downloaded as an Excel spreadsheet from the application portal. Complete the budget justification tab within the spreadsheet to explain how the funds will be used at the PACRI partner institution and Princeton University. Princeton PIs are strongly encouraged to work with their departmental grants managers to develop the budget and budget justification. Submission Information The Princeton PI must submit one complete proposal (3-page narrative and c.v. for each PI, combined into a single PDF) and budget spreadsheet through the application portal. Review Criteria A committee comprised of faculty members from Princeton and the PACRI partner institution will review the proposals and make funding recommendations based on quality, originality, and potential impact. Successful proposals will demonstrate a commitment to genuine collaboration, reflected in the research plan and budget. Call for Proposals Deadline June 30, 2022 Funding Up to a maximum of $250,000 per project Submission Princeton faculty members should apply on behalf of the project team through the application portal (NetID required to log in).
