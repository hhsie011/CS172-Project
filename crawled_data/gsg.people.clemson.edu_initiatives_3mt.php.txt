Clemson University's Graduate Student Government and the Graduate School co-hosted Clemson’s first 3MT competition in April 2014 as one of the premier events of the University’s first Research and Innovation Month. Each entrant was judged on delivery and content by a panel of judges that included staff, faculty, and community members. Since, 3MT has become a traditional event for graduate researchers to give crisp presentations about the innovations happening in the university, with the winner representing Clemson University at the regional level competition. Clemson University 3MT® Competition (2021) The 2021 3MT® competition at Clemson University will be held in two stages – a college level qualifying stage, and a final competition. This year's 3MT® champion will receive $1000 and attend the CSGS Regional competition in the Spring. We welcome everyone to join us at the Watt Center Auditorium on Clemson Campus November 19th, 9-2 PM for our in person 3MT Finals.
