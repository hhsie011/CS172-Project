In this Collaborative Collision we aimed to provide space and time for members of the campus community to highlight their AEI-related research and provide opportunities for future collaborations across disciplines. In addition to the exchange of ideas we hope that highlighting AEI-research will lead to a greater understanding of the need to pursue and support research that is innovative, compelling and can provide informed direction to practices and policies that are rooted in social justice. Collaborative Collision focuses on the individual's research background and interests. Our Research Profiles discuss each participant's expertise, and specific ways they can help, or be helped by, a collaborator. Download Participant's Research Profiles Who attended? Collaborative Collision: AEI featured presentations from research community members who have completed or are conducting research related to AEI. Key focus areas included health, education, criminal justice, gender, religion, veterans, disability/ableism, politics, and economics.
