We also offer co-op and international programs that take experiential learning to the next level. Undergraduate Co-Op The undergraduate co-op program offers students additional personal and professional growth opportunities through one-on-one mentoring from experienced preceptors in various clinical settings. Students gain valuable, hands-on experience and further develop interpersonal and professional skills. New graduates enter the workforce even more prepared to function independently in clinical settings, delegate appropriately and supervise unlicensed assistive personnel. Additional benefits: Ability to explore career options Experience at higher levels of responsibility Opportunity to establish professional contacts The co-op program does not extend the traditional four-year degree timeline. Students apply in January of their third year and serve in the program from June through graduation.

This close collaboration between the college and partnering clinical organizations provides students with clinical experiences that more closely model how nurses practice in the real world. Laura Brausch, MSN, RN, CDCES DEU Lead Instructor laura.brausch@uc.edu International Clinicals The college offers students opportunities to study abroad in various locations. Designed to develop responsible citizens of the world, participants earn course credits while enhancing their cultural competency and challenging their understanding of global health issues and disparities. In recent years, students have traveled to destinations in Ecuador, India, the United Kingdom and Tanzania. Partial scholarships for participants are available through UC International.
