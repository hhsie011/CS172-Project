If you have a state-issued ADA hangtag and have difficulties purchasing a parking permit in your preferred lot, please fill out the ADA Parking Form. Temporary The university may provide short-term parking to faculty, staff and students with disabilities by offering temporary ADA permits for parking on campus. To request parking based on temporary disability, please complete the temporary ADA parking permit request form, which will require this information: 1. A request including name, university ID and the length of time the temporary accommodation is being requested. 2. Upload documentation supporting your request for a temporary ADA parking permit. (This may include doctor’s request on letterhead or Physical Disability Parking Placard Application signed by a physician.) Please don’t include any information related to the diagnosis or reason for the ADA permit. This is not necessary to process a temporary ADA permit. After these items have been submitted and approved, Parking & Card Services will campus mail the approved temporary accommodations permit. If you have any questions please contact our office. Proper Display of Parking Permits Upon registration, a parking decal will be issued that is to be affixed to the vehicle on the inside, lower portion of the passenger-side, front windshield. For motorcycles, mopeds and scooters, the decal must be attached to the right-hand, upper arm of the cycle’s right-front fork. If the permit has been purchased but the decal is not properly affixed to the vehicle, it is considered to be the same type of violation as the “No-permit” category. Please note: Parking decals take three to five days to be mailed to the address you provided when you purchased your permit. You may print a temporary parking permit that should be displayed on the inside, lower portion of the passenger-side, front windshield.

Waitlist for Parking Permit If, after completing your parking selection registration you would like to seek availability in another lot, place yourself on the waitlist. This, too, will be prioritized based on lot availability and request order. As spaces become available, individuals on this list will be contacted by Parking & Card Services to make this change.
