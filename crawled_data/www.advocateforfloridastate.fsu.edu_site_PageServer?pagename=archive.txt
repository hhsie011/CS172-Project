The outcome is best characterized as the good, bad, and (maybe) ugly. There are several important victories secured by Florida State University, but it was not higher education’s best session, by any means. The Good FSU received $5.4 million in recurring revenue in a special legislative line item called National Ranking Operational Enhancement. A bill passed the House and Senate (SB 1080) promoted by FSU to enhance penalties on hazing and creating immunity from hazing prosecution for anyone that calls law enforcement or renders life-saving medical aid. The act was named “Andrew’s Law” after FSU student Andrew Coffey who died as a result of an off-campus hazing incident. Universities and colleges secured more flexibility to spend operating dollars on maintenance and renovations, previously restricted in law. This flexibility will help FSU invest our resources in much needed projects which is particularly important in light of the reduction in state support and prohibition on raising tuition. The Bad The Florida House of Representatives initially proposed a $135 million recurring cut to universities budgets., the Senate wanted to increase funding by $80 million. Ultimately the legislature met in the middle, which resulted in a $35 million base budget cut spread across all universities, resulting in a $5.6 base budget cut to FSU. The budget cut was almost completely erased by the special appropriation we received through the National Ranking Enhancement line, but we certainly did not see the increases that we have received in the past. FSU did not receive any new building funds this year. We were in good (or rather bad) company. One half of the universities received no building funds. The tax source for university building funds has dwindled exponentially in the last decade. There is cause for concern for the future of state building funds. The Legislature passed sweeping laws to restrict future building projects. Fortunately, FSU has two projects that have received funding in the past, and though we did not receive funding in this legislative session, we believe there is still support for finishing our projects. The (maybe) Ugly Of great concern is the legislature’s departure from appropriating funds according to formulas established in law. Specifically, they did not provide university performance funding or preeminence funding. There was not a great deal of discussion for this departure. What we do know is that the Legislature has commissioned a study to revamp the entire university funding structure, with a special emphasis on investing in preeminent universities. What we don’t know is what this new structure will look like, and what type of financial commitment legislators are ready to make for higher education. The uncertainty is uncomfortable, but there is reason to be optimistic. U.S. News and World Report recently identified the state of Florida as having the number one higher education system in the nation. We are contributing to the economic, social, and fiscal success of Florida. We are already retooling and reengaging state leaders on the value of higher education, particularly the value, efficiency, and excellence of Florida State University, We look forward to enlisting your help to spread the word. The next legislative session begins in January. We expect better days ahead. Thank you for your support of Florida State University. Your participation in the process is key to our future success. 2019 Quick Budget Guide 2018 Legislative Priorities Toggle Priorities Priority Request Maintenance $20,000,000 Preeminence $25,000,000 World Class Faculty and Scholars $25,000,000 Professional and Graduate Degree Excellence $20,000,000 Facilities Interdisciplinary Research & Commercialization Building $22,225,899 Legacy Hall Business Building $17,000,000 STEM Teaching Laboratory $6,966,187 FAMU-FSU Joint Use Engineering Building $15,200,000 Tallahassee Campus Projects FAMU-FSU Engineering Integrated Advancement $6,394,000 Panama City Campus Project Hurricane Michael Repair and Restoration $3,800,000 Rural Northwest Florida Public Health $578,544 2018 Budget Guide 2017 Legislative Priorities and Outcomes Toggle Priorities Preeminence Funding - $20 million Florida State University has used preeminence funding in the past to make considerable investments in the quality and stature of the university, and it’s working. In 2016, we had the greatest rise in national public university rankings, climbing 5 spots. FSU has a goal to become a Top 25 university and a leader in student career readiness. Preeminence funds will allow us to continue the strategic investments, particularly in the STEM fields. Outcome - $19.5 million Faculty Retention & Lowering Student/Faculty Ratio - $31.5 million Florida State University’s current student faculty ratio is 25 to 1, which places us at 168th in the country according to US News and World Report. Investments in new hires combined with faculty retention would lower our ratio to 21 to 1. FSU’s ultimate goal is 17 to 1, which is the level that Top 50 universities provide. This investment would improve student success and promote growth in key academic areas. Outcome - World Class Faculty and Scolars Program -- S11 million Graduate and Post-Doctoral Students - $18.5 million Florida State University has a disproportionately lower number of graduate students and postdocs than our Public Research I peers. Graduate students and post-doctoral research associates (postdocs) are integral to the research activity of top universities. Our current graduate student-to-undergraduate student ratio places us at 59th out the 81 amongst these peers. Our postdoc population is currently around 65% of the average Public Research I university. FSU is committed to dramatically growing its research activity, but this is not possible without significant expansion of the graduate student and postdoc populations. Outcome - $9 million Performance Funding - $10.6 million Florida State University has responded to performance-based funding by aligning key efforts and resources to strengthen student success. Performance funding has enabled FSU to make considerable investments in elevating our retention and graduation rates, raising our retention rate to 94% and four-year graduation rate to 65%. FSU is ranked in the top 15 of all public universities in the country on this specific metric. Continued performance funding will extend FSU’s trajectory and enable even more students to receive the support and engagement needed to graduate and succeed in the job market. Outcome - $12.5 million Strategic Academic and Research Buildings EOAS $29 million This investment will complete the Earth, Ocean, Atmospheric Science Building. Outcome - $16,040,737 IRCB $10 million Total state cost for the Interdisciplinary Research & Commercialization Building, funded by a 50%-50% partnership of state and private funds. Outcome - $6,774,101 College of Business Legacy Hall $10 million Planning and Engineering for an $83 million building funded by a 50%-50% partnership of state and private funds. Outcome - $5 million STEM Teaching Lab Building $5 million The facility will allow FSU to address the critical shortage of quality teaching labs on campus and to provide inventory of instructional space with modern systems that can support the STEM disciplines. Outcome - $4,233,813 Land Acquisition $5 million The FSU Master Plan identified strategic land purchases that will enhance the opportunities for research and learning buildings on the main campus. FSU has one of the most densely populated campuses in the entire SUS. Outcome - $4 million VETOED 2016 Legislative Priorities Toggle Priorities Each year, Florida State University administrators identify priorities determined to be vital to the operation and growth of the university. Below were the top priorities for the 2016 Legislative Session, which began on January 12th and ended on March 11th. Session outcomes are listed after each priority. 1. Increase Preeminence • $10 million The legislature established criteria for state universities to meet in order to achieve preeminent status. FSU meets all 12 of the 12 metrics required for preeminence, which supplements the university’s annual base budget with $25 million in preeminence funding. This enhancement has, to date, allowed Florida State to hire 57 new faculty members in STEM fields and other disciplines, and take on 23 campus-based entrepreneurs, who teach students how to turn their ideas and innovations into practical enterprises. Boosting preeminence funding by an additional $10 million will allow FSU to stay nationally competitive in its efforts to attract top-tier faculty, particularly in STEM fields, and move into the Top 25 among public universities. In addition, performance-based funding is allocated to state universities that exceed Board of Governors benchmarks and FSU anticipates again surpassing these standards, making performance-based funding an ongoing priority for 2016. Outcome: The legislature appropriated an additional $10 million for preeminence to Florida State, for a total of $35 million in annual recurring preeminence funding. In addition, $500 million in performance funds, which are tied to a set of BOG metrics distinct from the legislature’s preeminence metrics, also passed this session. 2. Florida State University Facilities A number of factors have negatively impacted state revenue sources dedicated to the construction, renovation and expansion of educational facilities. As such, facility priorities at Florida State include: Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science (EOAS) Building This complex, which has been partially funded for construction, is designed to create an environment where earth-science disciplines can interact in a collaborative and interdisciplinary manner to provide instruction, conduct research, and expand public service. The EOAS facility will include classroom space, teaching labs, study space, research laboratories, and administrative and academic-support services. Also, by placing these three major divisions under one roof, Florida State will be able to eliminate three antiquated buildings (saving significant maintenance dollars), provide instructional innovation, increase research potential, and grow the number of STEM degrees. Construction completion request: $35 million Outcome: $12 million was appropriated for this project Interdisciplinary Research and Commercialization Building (IRCB) STEM faculty in the physical sciences and engineering typically share core facilities, such as research labs, since these arrangements facilitate collaborations across departments that can lead to unanticipated discoveries. Through construction of the IRCB, Florida State will take a significant step toward this new model of cooperative space that is open and flexible, and has the ability to grow and adapt to change. Additionally, the IRCB will provide incubator space for the development of startup companies based on university inventions and discoveries, and the commercialization of its intellectual property. Construction phase request: $36 million Outcome: Was not addressed College of Business The development of a new complex for the FSU College of Business will provide significant and necessary increases to the instructional, technology and collaborative-learning spaces required for robust commerce-focused and research-based instruction to future business leaders. This facility will house seven departments, including the Dedman School of Hospitality, along with entrepreneurial space to accommodate advanced networking and career development opportunities. Planning phase request: $2.5 million Outcome: Was not addressed Deferred maintenance/renewal of facilities To keep timeworn classrooms and labs functional and supportive of the university's mission, Florida State requires substantial investments in capital maintenance/renewal projects just to address the existing backlog. According to the 2015 Sightlines Report, these investments will significantly reduce day-to-day repair and maintenance costs, provide greater reliability and efficiencies, and extend the life of existing buildings, systems and equipment. Current backlog: $30.7 million Outcome: $61,804,669 was appropriated for State University System projects, of which $8,825,475 will go to FSU. 3. Courtelis Facilities Matching Gift Program • $10.5 million In 2011, the Courtelis Matching Gift program was suspended and, consequently, no gifts from that point forward qualified for a state match. However, Florida State still had more than $10.5 million in prior gifts waiting to be matched before the suspension. These donations are critical to facilities construction and Florida State requests this program be reinstated and the prior-gift backlog be fully funded. Outcome: Was not addressed 4. College of Law Scholarships/Faculty • $1 million FSU requests that last year’s $1 million non-recurring allocation be made recurring. This revenue will be divided between student scholarships (approximately $600,000) and two additional faculty hires (approximately $400,000) to enhance the Law School’s ability to attract and retain high-achieving students, improve its student-faculty ratio, and maintain the FSU College of Law’s Top 25 national standing among public law schools. Outcome: The legislature funded this project. 5. FAMU-FSU College of Engineering • $6.6 million To improve the academic quality, research rigor, efficiency and efficacy of the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering, critical investments are required. These funds will allow for the hiring of five additional faculty members in areas of strategic need, and address the cost of equipment, technology, labs, and other research essentials for all newly hired engineering faculty. Benefits to the state include marked increases in degree-holders in core engineering fields, levels of external-grant funding, number of patents filed, startup companies launched, and the commercialization of research products. Outcome: Was not addressed Additional Outcomes: Black Student Union Renovation The legislature appropriated $1.5 million for this project.
