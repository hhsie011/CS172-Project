We are committed to freedom of inquiry-the freedom to think, to question, to criticize, and to dissent. We will pursue excellence in our research and educational missions with the single-mindedness that marks great commitments. We will prepare our students for rewarding lifelong careers and will instill in them a continued and permanent dedication to the search for knowledge and the search for truth. We will provide them with the foundations for ethical citizenship and service to others, a respect for differences among people, and a commitment to high standards of thought and communication. We will provide service to our community and beyond, including the delivery of high-quality, compassionate care through an academic health system. We will strive to transform the world in positive ways through innovative education, impactful research and scholarship, and the translation of knowledge into solutions. Founded in 1925 by a group of Miami citizens who believed that an institution of higher learning was necessary for the development of their young and growing community, the University has matured into a major research university and academic health system. Located within one of the most dynamic and multicultural cities in the world, the University is a distinctive community with a variety of races, ethnicities, customs, genders, and faiths. Its geographic location uniquely positions the University to be both local and global in outlook and outreach. We aspire at the University of Miami: to be a global university with an intentionally hemispheric strategy, pursuing inclusive engagement as a bridge across the Americas to the rest of the world; to be an excellent university, striving to achieve the highest standards of performance in every aspect of our work; to be a relevant university, connecting scholarship to real-world solutions; and to be an exemplary university, offering a model to society through the steadfast achievement of our mission.
