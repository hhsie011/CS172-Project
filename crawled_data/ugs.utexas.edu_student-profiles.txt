It’s harder to go out there and change the world if we stay in our comfort zone. Pranav Atreya Major: Computer Science and Physics Graduation Year: 2023 Don’t be afraid to do research in an area you don’t know much about or think is not that interesting. It may be that over the course of your research you develop a deep interest for it! Nitya Kopparapu Major: Biochemistry and Elements of Computing Graduation Year: 2022 It has been the most incredible experience to be able to do research, present it, and win awards for it. Quynh-Tram Nguyen Major: Medical Laboratory Science Graduation Year: 2024 To those thinking about research, I would tell them to not be afraid and to just go for any opportunity they are considering because it will surprise them how natural and welcoming research can be. It is not a competition, but rather a supportive and patient community ready to welcome any contributions from passionate minds. Yangxinyu Xie Major: Computer Science and Mathematics Graduation Year: 2021 I really encourage students to try out different research projects to find ones that interest them the most and then stick to those projects, as the more you persevere, the more you learn and enjoy. David Park Major: Chemistry Graduation Year: 2023 Research something you are passionate about. Don’t research something that you’re not interested in because you want to build your resume or you want to publish a paper. Passion really shows in research. Meesh Boston Major: Neuroscience There are a lot of people who will be quick to say you can't do this with kids, but you absolutely can. Christella Villatoro Major: Psychology and Sociology Be proactive and keep open communication with your professors. Richard Champlain Major: History Find your balance. You need time to study, but you also need to spend time with your family and, occasionally, time away from both school and family. Kristin Godfrey Major: Mathematics I love the pride my children have when they tell others that their mom is a Longhorn.
