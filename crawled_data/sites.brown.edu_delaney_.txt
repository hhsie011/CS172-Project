Skip to content Delaney Laboratory: Chemistry and Biology of DNA Repair Menu Research People Publications Meetings News Photos Alumni The Delaney Laboratory at Brown University aims to establish a chemically logical roadmap to understand how DNA damage relates to genetic change and human disease. With a focus on the biochemistry and enzymology of DNA repair we exploit our abilities to synthesize modified DNA nucleobases and study their properties within well-defined systems. We are particularly interested in the role of packaging of DNA into chromatin and how that packaging influences repair of DNA damage. Proudly powered by WordPress / Theme: Shoreditch by Automattic.
