As part of that commitment to inclusion, Penn provides access and support to undocumented students, including those with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) status. We have established a phone number and email address for questions and referrals to DACA resources and support: 215-573-3222 (3-DACA) and DACAinfo@upenn.edu. If you require immediate assistance – e.g., if you or someone you know has been taken into custody by immigration or law enforcement – contact 215-898-4357 (215-898-HELP) for 24-hour assistance to be connected to necessary services.
