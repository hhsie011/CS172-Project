Our Programs offer students an interdisciplinary approach to a liberal arts education, and the opportunity to pursue a nontraditional, undergraduate experience. Students in these Programs are able to immerse themselves in two distinct academic, social, and cultural environments while earning two undergraduate degrees in four years. Explore the academic programs below: SCIENCES PO DUAL BA PROGRAM As the first transatlantic dual degree program, the Sciences Po Dual BA Program has a longstanding history of offering students a global undergraduate experience. During the first two years of the program, our students' studies focus on social sciences and language instruction in the campus-specific region of study, before attending Columbia where they complete the University's Core and major requirements. Learn More TRINITY COLLEGE DUBLIN DUAL BA PROGRAM The Trinity College Dublin Dual BA Program students access an international experience that draws on both the traditional and innovative, that is both challenging and allows them to develop a deeper understanding of an increasingly globalized world.

VISION The International Dual Degree Programs encourage students to challenge their own ideas and assumptions through different teaching styles, methods, and experiences while offering them the opportunity to hone their resilience, develop their character, and allow them to recognize their own agency and ability to help others.

MEET DUAL DEGREE PROGRAM STUDENTS Dual Degree Program students are nontraditional by choice, making a deliberate decision to pursue an education that exposes them to diverse cultures, customs, and contexts. The programs attract bright, adventurous, diverse, and mature students with a willingness to listen and learn from different perspectives and adapt to changing environments. “Like college everywhere, this experience is what you make of it—you will be faced with challenges, but if you keep working through them, it might just be the best thing that could ever happen to you." - Abby Edwards '21GS, Sciences Po Dual BA "Being in Ireland has given me the chance to travel to new places, learn more about the world around me, and see things that I wouldn’t have seen at a typical American college." - Quinn Houlahan '23GS, Trinity Dual BA "My Columbia journey so far has taught me a remarkable lesson: be bold and stay confident. No matter how insignificant the changes may seem to be, we should always believe in our ability to make a difference." - Eric Wong '20GS, CityU Joint Degree International Dual Degree Programs Admissions Students interested in the International Dual Degree Programs in partnership with Sciences Po, Trinity College Dublin, and Tel Aviv University must apply by January 2 for fall enrollment.
