During the Give Light Campaign, the School of Education will focus their fundraising efforts in the following areas: Endowed Scholarships to meet the needs of students and open doors for those called to be teachers. Endowment and expendable funds to bolster programmatic capacity and provide global learning experiences. The following are the School of Education’s highest priority fundraising projects that are being highlighted in the current phase of the Give Light Campaign. The School will bring forward other opportunities for the Baylor Family to support the talented students and faculty within the School of Education. Endowed Scholarships Teachers can have a transformational impact in the lives of their students. They fulfill a great need in society. But to attain their dreams of becoming a teacher, Baylor’s education majors must have the support of scholarships. For those who have significant financial need, the debt associated with seeking a degree in a helping field such as teaching can be daunting. Investment in today’s students will ensure tomorrow’s classrooms are filled with highly skilled, compassionate professionals who value education’s impact on society. The School of Education is calling upon members of the Baylor Family to support our students through the following two ways: Endowed Scholars Fund: A gift of $500,000 to establish a named Scholars fund to provide enhanced learning opportunities within the context of a scholarship program within the School of Education.

Endowment gifts provide sustaining, permanent funding, helping to ensure the continued impact of the School’s programs and services.
