Curriculum IPB Minor Curriculum Apply Publications Home Bassham, Walley, and Yin labs: BAF1 mediates BES1 degradation via autophagy About Plant Biology The Interdepartmental Plant Biology (IPB), previously Interdepartmental Plant Physiology Major (IPPM), educates scientists in basic plant biology, including but not limiting to plant molecular biology, plant cell biology, plant physiology, and plant organismal biology and provides training in the most state of the art methods and technologies. Graduate study in IPB, leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. Degrees, is offered through eight participating departments: Agronomy, Biochemistry, Biophysics & Molecular Biology (BBMB), Chemical and Biological Engineering (CBE), Chemistry, Ecology, Evolution and Organismal Biology (EEOB), Genetics Development & Cell Biology (GDCB), Horticulture, and Plant Pathology.
