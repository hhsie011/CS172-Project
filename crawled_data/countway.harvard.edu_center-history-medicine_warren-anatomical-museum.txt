See renovation page for details. The Warren Anatomical Museum is one of the last surviving anatomy and pathology museum collections in the United States. In 1847, Harvard anatomist and surgeon John Collins Warren retired and donated his teaching collection to Harvard Medical School. Until 1999, the Museum was in the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology. It is now an integral part of the Countway Library's Center for the History of Medicine. No longer a brick and mortar museum, the collection lives on as a teaching and research resource. Within the larger Center, it still manages Harvard's historical anatomy and pathology collections. The Museum continues to grow and it collects the artifacts and history of the Harvard health science community. Its mission is to inform contemporary medicine, the Harvard health community, and the public.
