PreviousNext THE ALFRED E. WATSON TROPHY Presented annually to Dartmouth's top male student-athlete of the year. Winner: Jalen Mackie (Football) Entering his senior year with a total of just 10 tackles to his credit, Mackie emerged as the focal point of the Big Green defense this fall, leading the Ivy League with nearly 10 tackles per game. Seven times the linebacker recorded the most tackles in a game during the season, twice collecting a career-high 13, including in the 31-7 victory over previously undefeated Princeton. He was named the Ivy League Defensive Player of the Week on two separate occasions and had at least 10 tackles in a game five times. Eight of Mackie's stops were for a loss with one sack, and he even added an interception in the season opener. A first-team All-Ivy League and All-New England selection, as well as a finalist for the Buck Buchanan Award, which is given to the top defensive player in the FCS, he earned his place on the Stats Perform All-America Third Team. https://dartmouthsports.com/news/2022/5/16/athletics-dartmouth-holds-2021-22-celebration-of-excellence.aspx Departments African and African American Studies Anthropology Art History Asian Societies, Cultures, and Languages Program Biological Sciences Chemistry Classics Cognitive Science Comparative Literature Computer Science Earth Sciences Economics Education Engineering Sciences English Environmental Studies Film and Media Studies French and Italian Geography German Studies Government History Humanities 1 & 2 Institute for Writing and Rhetoric Jewish Studies Latin American, Latino and Caribbean Studies Linguistics Mathematics Medieval and Renaissance Studies Music Native American Studies Philosophy Physics and Astronomy Psychological and Brain Sciences Religion Russian Sociology Spanish and Portuguese Studio Art Theater Women’s and Gender Studies Inclusivity “Dartmouth’s capacity to advance its dual mission of education and research depends upon the full diversity and inclusivity of this community…Diversity and inclusivity are necessary partners. Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Sociology Undergraduate Overview Majors Minors Honors The Thesis Proposal Past Honors Theses Courses Course Schedule by Term First Year Seminars Introductory Courses Methods Theory Lower Division Upper Division Culminating Experience Prizes & Awards Research Awards Transfer Credit Careers Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story What is Sociology?
