A complete application file for first-time concurrent students includes all information listed below. Continuing concurrent students must submit a new online application and signed concurrent approval forms for each semester they plan to attend. Application fees, transcripts and test scores do not need to be resubmitted. Apply Pay application fee or submit fee waiver Oklahoma State University accepts application fee waivers from ACT, SAT and NACAC. You can have your high school guidance counselor forward your application fee waiver through email at admissions@okstate.edu, by fax at (405) 744-7092, or through the mail to the address listed above. Oklahoma State University also accepts application fee waivers from students based on demonstrated need (for example: a student on free or reduced lunch programs). Your high school guidance counselor should send a letter that explains the demonstrated need through email at admissions@okstate.edu, by fax (405) 744-7092, or through the mail at the address listed above. Submit official transcripts & test scores Have your high school send Oklahoma State University your official transcript. Send Oklahoma State University your official scores from ACT and SAT when you take the test by including OSU's official code of 3424 for ACT and 6546 for SAT. We also accept test scores reported on your official high school transcript. OSU does not consider the essay component of the ACT/SAT for admission criteria listed above. Beginning in summer 2022, students have the option to apply to OSU without consideration of a test score. Students who select this option on the application will be considered for admission based on a full review of their high school transcript. Class rank is not required for test optional admission. This option also applies to home school, private, parochial or other non-public high schools which are not accredited by a recognized accrediting agency. Submit a signed concurrent approval formOnce you've completed your online application for concurrent enrollment, you will need to get approval from a parent or guardian, as well as a high school official to approve your participation. You can submit an electronic approval request form available upon completion of the online application.
