Skip to main content Skip to primary site menu Department of Mathematics Math DUG The Math Departmental Undergraduate Group (DUG) is a group of undergraduate students who enjoy math and want to take part in the mathematical community at Brown. We help math enthusiasts at Brown form a cohesive community and sponsor events that help to get more people interested in math. Primarily, we present accessible, fun math talks by people in the department — professors, grad students, and often undergraduates — where you can learn about some aspects of math that you don't normally see in class. These talks occur about every two weeks. The Math DUG also hosts the annual SUMS conference in the spring, an opportunity for undergraduates at Brown and from all around the Northeast to present mathematical research they've done. You don't have to be a math concentrator, or even be taking math classes, to participate in the Math DUG - anyone who is curious about mathematics is welcome and encouraged to come! Check out our Virtual Day on College Hill!
