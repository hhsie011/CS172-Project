APPLY GET INVOLVED Search this Website Search FADC Student Project Support The Fine Arts Diversity Council (FADC) supports and collaborates with the COFA units in the design and implementation of strategies that advance diversity. By actively establishing and fostering a culture of inclusivity throughout the College community, the council assists in the development of recruitment and retention strategies for underrepresented students, faculty and staff; provides forums for mutual respect, an appreciation of differences, and cross-cultural understandings; and prepares our community for a changing global society. We welcome proposals from COFA students for projects that will further the FADC mission. Up to $1,000 will be available for each proposal submitted; Proposals with complete information must be submitted at least four weeks before the proposed project. Proposals will be reviewed three times a year on Oct. 1, Feb. 1 and May 1. Proposals (with a detailed budget) will be reviewed by a COFA/FADC review team, and the council will respond within two weeks of proposal deadline. Students whose proposals receive funding will be expected to provide FADC with documentation of and images from the completed project. As part of their documentation, students are asked to submit a written reflection, final budget summary and any associated media including fliers, video clips, photos, announcement, etc. If you do not see the above form due to ad blockers or other browser issues, please access the form at: https://utexas.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0enIA7cVPLLlMtD Back to top Dean's Welcome Mission and Vision Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Fine Arts Diversity Strategic Plan Fine Arts Diversity Council Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Programs and Initiatives FADC Guest Artist Initiatives Proposal FADC Student Project Support Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Resources Directory Campus & Community Fine Arts Student Council Donors & Friends Advisory Council Fine Arts Parents Council Who We Are Dean's Welcome Messages from the Dean Mission and Vision Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Fine Arts Diversity Strategic Plan Fine Arts Diversity Council About FADC Fine Arts Diversity Committee Members FADC Early History Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Programs and Initiatives FADC Guest Artist Initiatives Proposal FADC Student Project Support Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Resources Directory Department of Art and Art History Staff & Faculty Butler School of Music Staff & Faculty Department of Theatre and Dance Staff & Faculty School of Design and Creative Technologies Staff & Faculty Texas Performing Arts Staff University of Texas at Austin Directory Campus & Community Fine Arts Student Council Donors & Friends Established Endowments The Doty Society E.
