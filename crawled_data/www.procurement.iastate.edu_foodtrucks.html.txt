ISU Procurement Services manages the food truck contracts and works with ISU Facilities Planning and Management and the ISU Parking Division to assess and find locations for the suppliers and to provide amenities (picnic tables, power, concrete pads) for the suppliers. Food trucks are generally available Monday thru Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Individual suppliers may open or close earlier or later, depending on customer traffic. Weather may also change availability. Suppliers may also choose to operate during break and summer session. Food trucks may also be available to provide catering/food for special events. Please contact the supplier directly to obtain pricing and availability. Note, you may still need to work with ISU Facilities Planning and Management or ISU Parking if space, parking, or other accommodations are needed for the food truck to serve your event.
