Full Text Research Research Overview My research concentrates mostly on late 19th and early 20th Century European and American Architecture. I am interested in the entire scope of architectural production and debate, from the minutiae of building technologies to the transatlantic discourse on skyscrapers and urbanism throughout the 20th Century. My publications on the history of film set design and architectural illumination have helped to define new approaches and fields of research. Research Statement I am currently finishing a monograph on the German-American Architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (Yale University Press).

In addition, I teach a lecture course about the history of movie set design, called "City and Cinema." Undergraduate Seminars often deal with different aspects of the Architectural History of Providence, but I have also taught seminars on individual architects such as Louis Sullivan, Frank Lloyd Wright, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, or about architectural movements such as "Deconstructivism in Architecture." Graduate seminars have dealt with questions of methods or, most recently with the design and execution of an exhibition about a local architect, Friedrich St. Florian. The exhibition opened on May 25th in the Bell Gallery at Brown University and its catalogue appeared at the same time. For the last three years I have taught each spring at Yale University's architecture school as the first Vincent Scully Visiting Professor of Architecture. I am currently the president of the Society of Architectural Historians.
