Information Technology Leadership Council (ITLC) To enable alignment of IT across the University, ITLC meetings are held with IT leaders representing 33 colleges, schools, institutes, University affiliates and major departments at Columbia. Bi-monthly meetings are held to discuss strategy and direction for University-wide projects and initiatives. Council members join working groups that meet to plan and discuss resources for relevant initiatives. Please ask your IT leader if you'd like to be involved. The ITSC (Information Technology Security Council) also convenes throughout the academic year, with a similar structure but instead focusing specifically on IT security.
