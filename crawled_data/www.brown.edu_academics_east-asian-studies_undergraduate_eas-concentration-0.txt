Recent graduates of the concentration have gone on to employment in public service, the media industry, finance, and consulting. A significant percentage of our concentrators continue their studies in graduate and professional schools within a few years of graduation.

Focus Requirement: In order to ensure intellectual coherence and focus in the concentration, at least three of the eight electives must focus on the geographic region associated with the student’s language study/expertise. For example, a concentrator studying Japanese language should take at least three courses focusing on Japan. Breadth Requirement: At least one of the eight electives must focus on content in an East Asian country or culture other than those associated with the language the student is using to satisfy the concentration’s language requirement.
