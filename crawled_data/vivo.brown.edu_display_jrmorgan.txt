Full Text PubMed Research Research Overview The Morgan lab invented a new method to grow living cells in three dimensions (3D) and is using this technology to answer fundamental questions in 3D tissue engineering, 3D cell-cell mechanics and 3D drug transport. These areas are relevant to important medical needs including the shortage of organs for transplantation, the lack of effective treatments for fibrosis, multi-drug resistance in cancer and the quest to find new and less toxic drugs while reducing the use of animals in research. Research Statement The Morgan lab has devised a new method for culturing cells in three dimensions (3D) and is using this technology to answer fundamental questions in three synergistic areas: 3D tissue engineering , 3D cell-cell mechanics and 3D drug transport . These areas are relevant to important medical needs including the shortage of organs for transplantation, the lack of effective treatments for fibrosis, multi-drug resistance in cancer and the quest to find new and less toxic drugs while reducing the use of animals in research. It has been widely recognized that cells cultured in 2D do not adequately mimic native tissues and organs and in recent years the field of tissue engineering has developed new methods for growing cells in 3D. The Morgan lab invented the 3D PetriDish®, now commercially available Microtissues, Inc (Sigma-Aldrich) to grow cells in 3D using micro-molded agarose gels. Unlike most methods in tissue engineering that attach cells to a scaffold, cells attach to each other in the 3D PetriDish®. Cells are seeded into micro-molded nonadhesive agarose gels where they self-assemble 3D multi-cellular microtissues of varying sizes and shapes from simple spheroids to more complex honeycomb structures in typically 24 hours. Like native tissue, cell density is high and cell-cell interactions such as mechanics and signaling are maximized. The Morgan Lab as well as many others has shown that this platform technology works for many different cell types including primary cells, cancer cell lines and stem cells. In 3D tissue engineering , the Morgan lab has shown that micro-molds can produce microtissues in complex shapes such as toroids and honeycombs and that these microtissues will fuse to one another when placed in close contact. These structures with their open lumens that mimic an element of the vasculature are intriguing and we are investigating whether these microtissues can be used as building blocks to fabricate larger tissues and eventually organs. In 3D cell-cell mechanics , the Morgan lab is making microtissues with various shapes such as loop ended dogbones, rods, and toroids-on-cones to investigate the mechanical forces that cells exert on one another in the context of a 3D multi-cellular microtissue. We have used the toroid-on-cone assay to quantify the work performed by a multi-cellular toroid as it contracts up the cone and shown that mixtures of fibroblasts and hepatocytes exert surprisingly high levels of force; a result relevant to fibrosis. In 3D drug transport , the Morgan lab is using 3D spheroids to quantify the uptake and diffusion of various drugs through the multiple layers of cells as well as the role of drug efflux pumps that pump drugs out of cells. Drug transport is of fundamental importance to the efficacy and toxicity of all drugs and so is of great interest to the pharmaceutical industry. Moreover, some of these efflux pumps are upregulated in cancer which can lead to multi-drug resistance, an important clinical problem in need of new and more effective inhibitors.
