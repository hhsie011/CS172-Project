Surveillance data suggest over one in five (21.6%) MSM in Malaysia are li ving with HIV. Contributing to this epidemic is the low uptake of HIV test ing and pre-exposure prophylaxis among Malaysian MSM. Technology-based app roaches\, such as chatbots\, are innovative strategies for improving linka ge to HIV testing and prevention services. In this session\, we will intro duce a culturally-tailored chatbot that was developed to increase HIV test ing and prevention among MSM in Malaysia. The facilitators and barriers to MSM's acceptance of chatbots and their preferred features will be introdu ced.\n\nSpeakers:\nZhao Ni\; Jeffrey Wickersham\n\nAdmission:\nFree\n\nDet ails URL:\nhttps://medicine.yale.edu/event/cira-talk-developing-a-chatbot- to-promote-hiv-testing-and-prevention/\n DTEND;TZID=Eastern Standard Time:20220602T100000 DTSTAMP:20220601T184009Z DTSTART;TZID=Eastern Standard Time:20220602T090000 LOCATION:URL: https://bit.ly/3KKL3MI SEQUENCE:0 STATUS:Confirmed SUMMARY:CIRA Talk: "Developing a Chatbot to Promote HIV Testing and Prevent ion" UID:ab5b51b5-2a05-47a1-b452-db866e8c6f74 END:VEVENT END:VCALENDAR
