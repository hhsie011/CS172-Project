Skip To Main Content ISU Police Search the website Open Search Box Open Mobile Menu Search the website Open Search Box ISU Guardian The Iowa State University community has a virtual guardian to walk you home on and off campus. ISU Guardian is an app with a full contact list of emergency and non-emergency personnel, push notifications about campus activity and crime, and a tip button for easy submissions to ISU Police. Simply download the app from the Apple App Store or Google Play. Determine and set your “guardians.” Guardians are notified they’ve been designated and can follow your GPS location on a map. The guardian does not need to have the app to be designated. When traveling during a time you’d like to have a guardian, set the timer for your expected travel time. The timer can be extended or reduced by the user. In order for the safety timer to work accurately, the GPS function within the app needs to be turned on. Allowing this function will give a more accurate location as to where assistance is needed and will help ISU Police respond more efficiently in a crisis. If you are experiencing a crisis situation, there is a button that links directly with a 911 dispatcher. In a non emergency situation, all of the community, campus, and police phone numbers are listed under the call directory icon. ISU Police are available to act as a guardian from 6:00 pm to 5:30 am. Anyone with an Iowa State NetID is able to use the app. Download it now.
